# Apprentices

In your pursuit of the art of magic, you are likely to want an apprentice. Though the Code of Hermes requires that you devote a season a year to teaching your apprentice

![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)

rather than doing research, the apprentice in turn is required to help you do your lab work. In addition, an apprentice provides you close human companionship and the chance to leave a living legacy when you die. Your apprentice will likely be the closest thing to a son or daughter that you, as a magus, will ever have.

## Minimum Competence to Teach an Apprentice

You may only have an apprentice if you are competent enough to teach someone every magical Art. Without a score of at least 5 in each of the Arts, you are not familiar enough yourself with the Arts to initiate someone else in their use.

## Finding Your Apprentice

Once you determine that you qualify to teach an apprentice, the next step is to find one. Among the common people there sometimes appear rare individuals with the Gift—those who have innate magical power. Only these individuals can become apprentices and eventually magi. Luckily for those magi who seek them, these people inevitably stand out from the crowd. They are almost invariably intelligent and curious, causing them to fit in poorly with the mass of ignorant, superstitious society. Also, most potential apprentices somehow attract supernatural attention to themselves. In many populations there is a youth who is prone to wandering alone at night, who is the subject of much town gossip, and who displays a precocious wit. Chances are that such a person is a potential apprentice.

Searching for an apprentice can lead to good storytelling and roleplaying possibilities, especially if the search is complicated by enemy forces or uncooperative members of the child's family. However, if you do not wish to make a story out of finding an apprentice, you may determine the results of the search with a die roll. For every season you spend searching for a potential apprentice, make a stress die and add your Perception. If the result is 6+, you find one. If you botch, you may think you've found a child fit to be an apprentice but are somehow duped, either by the child or by some power that replaces your child with its servant.

Your student should be between eight and seventeen years old at the beginning of apprenticeship (if you wish, roll a simple die + 7). Children younger than eight rarely have the discipline required for apprenticeship, and young adults older than seventeen are almost invariably set in their ways to the point that they are no longer fit for Hermetic training.

Being taken away by a magus to parts unknown is always disturbing and frightening to a new apprentice, even to one excited or relieved to be free of a miserable living situation. Some children chosen for apprenticeship are kidnapped by their masters, some are coaxed away with promises of knowledge and power, while others are actually offered (or sold) to magi by families who cannot handle the youngsters' strange ways. Though most children chosen to be apprentices come willingly and freely, the Code of Hermes does not require that they do. Strictly speaking, magi are allowed to obtain apprentices in whatever manner they wish.

### Training Your Apprentice

Once you have your apprentice, the training begins. Each year, according to the Peripheral Code of Hermes, an apprentice is guaranteed at least one season worth of training. If you do not provide this training, the apprentice is free to go to another magus, and you lose all that you have invested.

Use the rules in the Experience and Advancement section of the Storyguide chapter to train your apprentice, remembering that you must spend at least one season a year directly teaching. Keep in mind that you should try to impart a broad base of skills—refer to the house templates in the Character Creation chapter to give you an idea of what level of apprentice competence you should be shooting for.

You'll need to start with basic skills, like Scribe Latin, before your apprentice can even begin to learn more. Magic Theory is also important, not only for your apprentice, but for you—after all, the more he knows the better help he will be in the lab.

Of course, you don't have to do all of the teaching yourself. Your apprentice can study from books that you have, and you can certainly "farm out" your apprentice to others in the covenant to learn certain skills.

### Fleshing Out Your Apprentice

The basic benefit that an apprentice provides you is the addition of his Intelligence and Magic Theory scores to your Lab Totals ([see page 94](../page-refs/page-94.md)). If all you want is a lab assistant, you only need to keep track of your apprentice's Intelligence and Magic Theory scores, and after fifteen years, your apprentice becomes a full magus and leaves your service.

However, if created as a full character, an apprentice can be developed as the saga progresses into both a very important companion to your magus and a valuable member of the covenant. To create your apprentice as a character, determine Characteristics, Virtues and Flaws, and Abilities for a character of young age. You will want to leave some Virtues and Flaws open for Hermetic Virtues and Flaws that become manifest as the apprenticeship continues. Choose Abilities that the character learned in his childhood. As the saga progresses, update the apprentice's Abilities, magical Arts, spells known, and other statistics as you train him, just as you would those of any other character.

### The Value of an Apprentice

Aside from performing many tedious mundane tasks for you, such as cleaning up your lab, your apprentice helps you in the laboratory, adding his Magic Theory to your own. [See page 94](../page-refs/page-94.md) for more details on how an apprentice can help you in the lab.

### The Apprentice in Play

A fully developed apprentice makes a playable character. If you want to play an apprentice, keep in mind that you have no natural niche in the story. Grogs fight, companions provide skilled assistance, and magi have powerful spells. As an apprentice you are outclassed in all areas. Nevertheless, some stories are made exciting by an apprentice character or characters, as apprentices are interesting individuals, especially if there's no magus around to overshadow the apprentice's magic with his own.

When you are a magus and teacher, some of the best roleplaying opportunities for your apprentice arise when he is interacting with you. To encourage this, you may want to let another player roleplay your apprentice, or you may consider your apprentice a troupe character to be played by different members of the troupe at different times, much as a grog is.

### The End of Apprenticeship

Normally, an apprentice leaves after fifteen years of service, though one can leave at any time with the master's permission, or after learning all fifteen magic Arts. In some traditions, an apprentice must undergo a battery of tests by a tribunal of magi before being officially recognized as a magus; this famous **“apprentice's gauntlet”** has come to be dreaded by many a student.

## Basic Laboratory Activities

You use one sum, called the Lab Total, frequently in calculating your ability to accomplish various laboratory tasks. This total varies from task to task because it uses the Technique and Form appropriate to the task at hand. For instance, your Lab Total when learning a Rego Terram spell includes your Rego and Terram scores. Spell requisites might also apply, as can other modifications, depending on the specific activity.

Your basic Lab Total is:

**TECHNIQUE + FORM + INT + MAGIC THEORY**

### Arcane Studies

Knowledge of Magic Theory and the magical Arts are important to magi—so much so that many spend their entire lives in study. Magi may increase their Art scores in several different ways. Each is described in turn in the "Experience and Advancement" section, which begins on [page 185](../page-refs/page-185.md).

### Spells

Formulaic spells are a major measure of your power because they determine those things you can do easily and predictably. As a magus, you may learn the spells of others and invent your own.

#### Learning Spells

If another magus has written out a spell and you have a copy, you can try to learn it. The notes of most magi are incomplete, so learning spells from their private grimoires is difficult (see "Translating Spells," below). Assuming that you can read the spell in question, you can learn it in one season if your Lab Total equals or exceeds the spell's level. You get a bonus to your Lab Total for knowing a similar or variant spell (see "Similar Spells," [page 69](../page-refs/page-69.md)). If the spell is of the General level, your Lab Total is modified by +1 for every five levels of the spell you already know.

In addition to learning spells from written copies, you can be trained in individual spells by magi who know them. See "Training" on [page 187](../page-refs/page-187.md).

Requisites listed as part of a spell's description count for learning spells just as they do for casting them.

#### Inventing Spells

Inventing a spell is more difficult than learning one, but of course you don't need a copy of the spell to do it. First, decide the effects of the spell you wish to invent; you may pick a spell described in the Spells chapter to invent (to save you from having to find a copy), invent a variant of a spell listed there, or you can make up something completely on your own.

If you want to duplicate an existing spell, use the statistics given for it in the Spells chapter, but include your wizard's sigil (see "Sigils" on [page 60](../page-refs/page-60.md)).

If you create a variant of a spell in the Spells chapter (change its range, say, or allow it to affect a different kind of target), first refer to the spell that you are basing your spell on. Then determine whether you are changing the spell's range, duration, target, or a combination of those. The new spell's level is determined based on how radically the new spell is different from the old one. The method for determining the new spell's level is described under "Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets" on [page 104](../page-refs/page-104.md).

When you invent a completely new spell you must describe it fully, both in terms of its mechanics (range, duration, and target) and how it fits into the medieval paradigm. You must make sure that it takes into account the limits of magic ([see page 67](../page-refs/page-67.md)). To determine the new spell's level, you must first determine its Technique and Form. This should be a matter of common sense. Next, refer to the general guidelines for that Technique/Form combination, found in the Spells chapter. This will provide a list of what sorts of effects correspond to each spell level. Once you have determined this base level, check the default range, duration, and target for your Technique/Form combination. If you would like your spell to have a different range, duration, or target, refer to the guidelines for changing them under "Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets" on [page 67](../page-refs/page-67.md).

For example, say a magus wishes to create a spell that lights a fireplace. The spell is obviously Creo Ignem—it creates fire. Turning to the guidelines for Creo Ignem, we see that igniting something flammable (like wood) takes a level 5 spell. We also see that the basic range for Creo Ignem is Near, the basic duration is Momentary, and the basic target is Small. The magus wishes to be able to do this from across the room, so the range Near makes sense. He wants it to set logs on fire, but the magic need not sustain the fire—wood will burn by itself once ignited. The duration is therefore Momentary, as per the default. The magus decides that the target Small is not large enough to ignite the large fireplace in his covenant's great hall. Therefore, he must move the default target of Small up one step to Individual, adding five levels. The final level of the spell, then, is 5 (the basic level of the effect) + 5 (to move the target from Small to Individual), for a total of 10.

Once you have determined the specifics of the spell you are trying to invent, you must determine if you can actually invent it. Then, you must figure out how long it will take. You can only invent a spell if your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level. You get a bonus for knowing a similar or variant spell (+1 per five levels of similar spell—see "Similar Spells" on [page 69](../page-refs/page-69.md)), and you may also add your aura rating as a bonus to your Lab Total. Any requisites that the new spell has also count in figuring your Lab Total. For each point that your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level, you accumulate one point per season. When you accumulate points equal to the level of the spell, you invent it.

#### Copying Spells

All magi have grimoires containing their spells. These spells are not immediately useful to others, however, as they include all sorts of personal abbreviations and shortcuts that others cannot understand. (Remember that everything is written by hand in the Middle Ages.) In addition, some magi sprinkle their magic texts with bits of misdirection, which they can recognize and ignore themselves but which endanger others who take these parts of the text as genuine.

If you would like to copy a spell of yours so others can read and learn it, you can spend a season writing up to (Scribe Latin x 20) levels of spells to make them usable by others. Also, in one season, you can copy (Scribe Latin x 60) levels of spells that are already written understandably.

#### Translating Spells

If you want to translate the spells of another magus whose secrets and abbreviations you do not know, you must first roll to "break the code." For most magi's texts, the "code" is merely the author's personal style, so you only need to make an simple Intelligence + Scribe Latin roll of 6+ in order to learn the spell. If the author intentionally obscured the work, add the author's Intelligence to the ease factor of your roll, or raise it even higher if the information is actually in code. If you have broken a given magus' code in the past, you get a +3 modifier to decode other spells.

Once you have broken the author's code, you can determine the nature of the written spell. Upon breaking the author's code, you automatically determine the Technique and Form of the spell (as long as it is a Hermetic spell). To find out what the spell's level is, and what its effects are, you must roll a stress die + Lab Total and exceed the spell's level (which is known by the storyguide). Once you know the spell's Technique, Form, level, and effects, you can write a copy of the spell that may be read and used by others.

You get one roll to decode and one roll to translate a spell per season. If both rolls succeed, the process takes the length of a season. If either roll fails, the translation attempt fails and the season is wasted; the spell remains untranslated (although you may automatically try the second roll again in another season if you've already succeeded in the decoding roll). If you botch your translation roll, not only do you lose the season but something horrible happens. The copy of the spell may be ruined, or maybe you accidentally trigger only a part of the spell that adversely affects you or others.

You may spend a season to obscure up to (Scribe Latin x 20) levels of your own spells. There is rarely any benefit to obscuring a spell unless the spell is created as a trap or you have to share your library and want to keep your spells to yourself. To create a spell that's a trap, you must invent the spell as you do any other.

You may occasionally acquire a non-Hermetic spell, and wish to identify it. Non-Hermetic spells can be identified in a manner similar to that for Hermetic spells, but with much more difficulty. Even determining the Technique and Form may prove impossible without prolonged study. The actions required to identify any non-Hermetic spells are up to the storyguide.

### Vis Extraction

You can extract raw vis from a magical environment (that is, any area with a magical aura) by focusing the magical energy into a physical form. For each season that you spend extracting vis from the environment, sum your Creo + Vim + Magic Theory + (3 x Aura). For every full ten points in the result, one point of Vim vis is produced.

## Magical Enchantments

Physical creations, as surely as magical knowledge, can increase your power as a magus. In addition to talismans, which you can use to concentrate your magical powers, you can create invested devices, which mimic the powers of spells; potions, which affect those who use them; and longevity potions, which extend your mortal life. Since magical enchantments are unique creations that follow the logic of individual magi, determining how to use one that someone else has created can be a lengthy and even dangerous process.

Magical enchantments are created through a type of ritual magic, and therefore require a great deal of time, effort, and magical resources. You must take the time to prepare your lab for the task, gather all the necessary materials and equipment, and then craft your work in earnest, exercising great care with the details of the enchantment. In the end, you have an item that is independent and that generates its own magical energies in order to function, but that is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. Your magical signl figures just as prominently in the effects produced by your magical enchantments as it does in the effects produced by your spells.

It often requires raw vis to create magical enchantments. The process of enchanting an item transforms the vis, linking the magic power inexorably to the item in which it is instilled. Vis used for enchantments is thus transformed so that it is no longer usable for any other purposes, and it can never be extracted from the enchantment it is used to create. Magi sometimes refer to the magic of enchantments as "cooked," rather than "raw," vis.

Because the act of enchantment is itself a ritual, effects matching those of ritual spells may not be placed in any enchantment.

### Enchanted Devices

Enchanted devices come in three types: talismans, which enhance and focus your magic powers; invested devices, in which you instill effects that mimic the powers of spells; and lesser devices, which may be instilled with effects as invested devices but which are more limited in power and require fewer resources.

#### Form and Material

The first thing you must do for any magical device is choose the physical form of the item you wish to enchant—both the shape of the item and the item's component material. (Do not confuse the form of an item with the subset of arcane Arts that are called Forms). Look at the Form and Effect Bonuses Table to see what sorts of items have bonuses relevant to the types of enchantments you wish to place. You should also pay attention to mundane criteria as well as magical. Enchanting a gold sword might appeal to you, but such an item would be too heavy and soft to use in combat. And while a diamond might be perfect for your ring, do you have a diamond? You might have to go out into the dangerous world to find your materials, especially if your covenant is poor.

| Material | Base Points |
|----------|------------|
| cloth, glass | 1 |
| wood, leather | 2 |
| bone, soft stone | 3 |
| hard stone | 4 |
| base metal | 5 |
| silver | 6 |
| gold | 10 |
| semi-precious gem | 12 |
| precious gem | 15 |
| priceless gem | 20 |

| Size | Example | Multiplier |
|------|---------|-----------|
| tiny | ring, bracelet, pendant, any gem | x1 |
| small | wand, dagger, belt, cap | x2 |
| medium | sword, tunic, boots, skull | x3 |
| large | staff, shield, cloak, skeleton | x4 |
| huge | boat, wagon, human body, small room | x5 |

**Example:** To prepare a silver shield for enchantment would require one season and 24 (6 for the material x 4 for the size) pawns of Vim vis.

Before you begin the process of enchantment, you must acquire the item you will enchant, and note its size and composition.

#### Preparation for Enchantment

Talismans and invested devices are powerful items that require special preparation before any effective enchantments can be performed on them.

Once you have the physical item to enchant, you must spend a season preparing it. To do this, you must simply expend the time and a number of pawns of raw Vim vis equal to the number derived from the "Material and Size Table" for the form you have selected.

It is possible to enchant only part of an item. For example, you can enchant a ruby on the end of a staff. Because it is on a staff, the gem gains bonuses appropriate to the shape (but not the material) of the staff (see the Form and Effect Bonuses Table), and you don't have to enchant the whole staff. However, any effect that relies on the attachment of

### Talismans

Talismans help you concentrate and extend your magical powers. A talisman is a very personal item that contains magics and materials that tie it intimately to you and that can be used as a channel for your magical power.

To create a talisman, you must first choose the item's physical form and prepare the item for enchantment as described above. Once you have prepared the item for enchantment, you must simply spend one season attuning the item's mystical energies to your own. At the end of this season, you have a talisman that may be used to aid your magic.

Talismans have several powers. First, your talisman is an extension of your touch as long as you're in contact with it. When you cast a spell of Touch range, you may reach your target by touching him with your talisman. Thus, if your talisman is a staff, your reach is increased by the length of the staff. Second, you always have an arcane connection to your talisman, making it easy to find if it is lost (but also making it a hazard if it falls into enemy hands). Third, your talisman is fully protected by your Magic Resistance if you are touching any part of it. Thus, while an outstretched staff can extend outside the radius of your usual Magic Resistance, it is still fully protected. Finally, even when you're not touching your talisman, it receives the Magic Resistance offered by your Form scores.

In addition to the basic powers of a Talisman, you may also, at any time, spend a season to open your talisman to one kind of magic attunement, based on the shape and material of the talisman. Use the "Form and Effect Bonuses Table" to determine what attunements are possible. Your talisman may be able to accept more than one kind of attunement, and can hold more than one attunement, but you can only invest one new attunement per season. For instance, a magus can enhance his staff talisman by spending a season to attune it to spells that control things at a distance. He then gets a +4 bonus on rolls with spells that control things at a distance (because that is the bonus listed on the Form and Effect Bonuses Table). He could further enhance it to give him a +3 to project bolts and missiles (for example), but that would take another season.

Bonuses from attunements only apply when the magus is touching the talisman. They do not apply to Magic Resistance or any laboratory activities. There's no limit to the number of attunements a talisman can have at one time, though remember that you can only add one per season. There's no roll involved in giving your talisman an attunement bonus; you must simply spend the time to get the bonus.

You can only have one talisman at a time; one must be completely destroyed before you can make another, and you cannot make a talisman for someone else.

You can instill effects into a talisman (see "Invested Devices," below), and because the talisman has already been set up to have an intimate connection to your magic ability, you receive a +2 bonus to your Lab Total to invest it with effects. You can also turn an item already invested with magical powers into your talisman. Whether you invest an item with effects or whether it already has magic powers, an item only needs to be prepared for enchantment once. When that has been done, you simply need to spend the season to make it your talisman.

Note that a talisman is different from a spell focus. A talisman is personalized to a magus and can give a bonus to many of his spells. A spell focus, on the other hand, is specific to a given spell (see those listed in the Spells chapter). You can, if you wish, make a spell focus into your talisman—it retains all the benefits of both.

#### Instilling Effects into Talismans

Once an item has been prepared for enchantment, you may spend time and magical resources to bestow magical powers upon it. When you do so, you create an invested device.

The number of Vim vis points spent during preparation of your invested device (outlined under "Preparation for Enchantment," above) sets a limit on the magical effects that can now be enchanted into the device. Each effect you bestow on the device requires a number of pawns of raw vis. The total number of pawns spent to bestow effects on the device cannot exceed the number of pawns spent to prepare the device in the first place.

### Invested Devices

#### Designing the Effect

First, choose an effect to be invested in your device and determine its level. An effect is like a spell, and must be fully defined, as a spell is. You may base the effect on a spell from the Spells chapter, or may invent your own effect. If inventing a new effect, you must design the effect carefully, as if inventing a new spell. The level of the effect is the equivalent of its spell level. You should confirm your effect level with the storyguide. Also, remember the effect's starting level. The actual level of the effect may change as you define the parameters of the effect, but the starting level is essential to scores, like Penetration, that are needed when the effect is used.

After laying out the parameters of the effect, you must decide how frequently you use the effect. Consult the "Effect Frequency Table." The number you choose corresponds to a modifier, which is added to the level of the effect. Next, if the effect is not of Constant Use, you must specify a triggering action or ritual of some kind to activate the effect. The trigger must be specific about exactly what actions need to be performed. A trigger can involve a command word or phrase, moving the item in a specific way (for example, waving or pointing a wand), a stance to be adopted, or anything physical that you can imagine. The enchanted item cannot read thoughts, so the trigger action must be physical, not mental.

Finally, choose any effect modifications you wish to apply to the device (see below), adjusting the level of the effect for each modification.

#### Effect Modifications

You have some options on how effects in an invested device operate. They are listed below. These modifications defy the "standards" for invested devices which are described under "Using Invested Devices," below.

| Frequency | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 use per day | 0 |
| 2 uses per day | +1 |
| 3 uses per day | +2 |
| 6 uses per day | +3 |
| 12 uses per day | +4 |
| 24 uses per day | +5 |
| 50 uses per day | +6 |
| Unlimited. | +10 |
| Constant use. | +5 |

*Note: constant use can only apply to effects that can function constantly, such as invisibility.*

**Vis Pumping In the Field:** When investing an effect, you may leave the effect open, giving the item's user the option to use vis "in the field" to increase the effect's range and duration. For each factor of range and duration that you want to leave open to accept vis in the field, add +3 to the effect's level. For instance, a healing wand only heals damage temporarily unless vis is used with it (the same amount of vis that is required for the spell being imitated). Therefore, you must leave the user the option to add vis to extend the duration of the effect, thereby adding 3 levels to the effect. The number of pawns of vis that may be used in the field to extend range and duration is limited. The wielder may only expend a number of pawns of vis equal to his score in the Art that corresponds to the type of vis being used.

**Penetration:** You may elect to have the effect make Penetration rolls using the Art scores you had when the effect was originally invested, rather than using the device's own power, by adding +4 to the level. (Of course, this means you must record these scores for future use.) You may also elect to have the effect Penetrate according to the current Art scores of its wielder. This adds +8 to the effect's level.

**Concentration:** When investing an effect, you can arrange to have the device maintain concentration on the effect for the wielder. This option adds +5 to the effect's level. Note that the wielder still needs to concentrate to change how the effect is used. For instance, a levitation belt that does not require concentration can hold someone in the air, but to move up or down the wielder must concentrate. Effects left to their own concentration start to wear off at sunset and sunrise. At these times the wielder must concentrate on the effect for a few moments to perpetuate it until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first.

**Effect Use:** You can restrict the use of a device's effect to a specific list of people (for example, to you and all your current apprentices) by adding +3 to the level of the effect. Otherwise, invested devices can be activated by anyone who knows their trigger actions.

**Charges:** It is possible to instill an effect whose power expires after a given number of uses. The following table lists Lab Total modifiers to place a given number of charges in a device. Each time the power you have instilled is activated, one charge is used up. When all the charges have been used, the item stops functioning.

*Note that you must still choose a number of uses per day when you instill an item with charges. Thus such an item is restricted in how often and how much it can be used. You cannot give charges to an item of Constant Use.*

A device that uses charges can be made rechargeable by adding 5 levels to the level of the effect. Actually recharging the effect takes one season and costs an amount of vis equal to that which was originally spent investing the effect. In order to recharge a device, you must either have the lab text (see below) from the device's creation, or you must successfully investigate the power which you are recharging.

| Number of Charges | Effect Level Modifier |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | –5 |
| 2 | –4 |
| 3 | –3 |
| 6 | –2 |
| 12 | –1 |
| 24 | 0 |
| 50 | +1 |
| 100 | +5 |

**Effects that Govern the Device Alone:** Some effects work only on the device in which they are placed, such as a staff that grows thorns like the spell *Transformation of the Thorny Staff*. If the effect only works on the device containing it, the total effect level, after all other modifications, is divided by 2.

#### Instilling the Effect

Once you have designed the effect that you want to invest in your device, you have to perform the ritual of joining. Your Lab Total (based on the Form and Technique scores appropriate to the effect) is compared to the total modified level of the effect. Several other modifiers apply to your Lab Total:

- If the effect you are investing mimics a spell with casting requisites, those requisites apply to your Lab Total.
- If one of the bonuses listed on the "Form and Effect Bonuses Table" for the material or form of the device you are using matches the effect being invested, that bonus is added to your Lab Total. For example, if you were enchanting a lamp to constantly produce magical light, you would add +7 to your Lab Total.
- Add the strength of your magic aura (probably that of your covenant) to your Lab Total.
- For each effect already in the device that has a Technique and/or Form in common with the effect being invested, add +1 to your Lab Total.

You can only invest an effect if this modified Lab Total exceeds the modified level of the effect. For each point by which your total exceeds the level, you accumulate 1 point per season. When you accumulate points equal to the effect's modified level, you invest the power. (Thus, if your Lab Total is double the modified level of the effect, you can invest it in one season.)

For every 10 points, or fraction thereof, of the modified level of the effect, you must also expend one pawn of raw vis of an Art appropriate to the effect being invested. This vis is expended in the first season you begin investing the effect. But remember, a given item can only hold a limited number of effects. If the amount of raw vis required to instill an effect brings the total amount of raw vis used above the total used to prepare the item for enchantment in the first place, the effect cannot be invested. So if you are enchanting a silver dagger (which takes 12 pawns of vis to prepare for enchantment), you can only put 12 pawns worth of effects in it. If the dagger already has 10 pawns worth of effects, an effect that requires 3 pawns of vis (that is, an effect of level 21 to 30) does not fit; you cannot put it in the dagger.

### Using Invested Devices

Several rules apply to all invested devices, unless an effect modification has been made, and specifically states otherwise.

- If your effect is based on a spell that has two ranges or durations listed for it, the shorter is used for each.
- When you use a magic effect against someone or something with Magic Resistance, you have to make a magic Penetration roll, as you do with a spell. It is the power of the effect itself that attempts to penetrate, though, not your own power. The device's Penetration score equals the starting level of the effect (the level of the spell being duplicated, not modified by frequency of use or other factors).
- Unless otherwise specified, an effect that duplicates a spell requiring concentration to maintain also must be concentrated on to be maintained.
- All Targeting rolls demanded by a device's effects are made by the wielder of the device, using the wielder's Finesse score.
- If a person gains possession of your magical device and knows the triggering actions of its effects, that person may utilize the device. Even if the possessor does not know the triggering action, he may investigate your item in the lab to learn its effects.
- You can use one effect from one item each round, using the appropriate trigger action for each. You must make any Targeting or magic Penetration rolls that are necessary, but do not roll for Fatigue.
- If the enchanted device is broken, all its powers are lost.
- You may use an enchanted item before it is "filled up" with effects and still add effects later.

### Lesser Enchanted Devices

Invested devices, because of their great power, take a great deal of time and vis to create. Lesser enchanted devices are a more limited, but less expensive type of magical device.

To create a lesser enchanted device, choose the shape and material of the item as for an invested device, but you need not take a season to prepare the item for enchantment. You merely perform a limited preparation on the device and instill a single effect in it, both within the same season. No initial Vim vis is spent to "open" the item to enchantment.

The amount of vis you may instill in the device, and thus the level of the power you may instill, is limited both by the material and size of the item (as per the Material and Size table) and also to your Magic Theory + Vim score.

You must design the effect you are instilling just as carefully as you do when instilling an effect in an invested device. Indeed, all the modifiers for invested devices apply here. If your Lab Total is twice the level of the effect (after all modifications), you enchant the effect into the item. If not, the effect is beyond your ability to instill in this limited manner; you must prepare and enchant the item as an invested device, or choose a power that is more within your capabilities (both of which are projects for another season). If you attempt to instill a power and fail, your vis is wasted.

After a single season, your work is complete. You may never instill any other powers into the item, even if the material and size of the item allow for more. A lesser enchanted device may never be used as a talisman.

### Charms Against Magic

Even though there is no spell to do so, magi can invent magic devices (invested or lesser enchanted) to protect the bearer against magic. The effect uses the Arts Rego and Vim, and the level of the effect is equal to the Magic Resistance it provides. The charm works continually on the bearer of the device (though Constant Use must still be chosen for the effect frequency). The effect works like the Parma Magica, but is incompatible with Parma Magica or any other type of magic resistance. Thus, the bearer may not add his score in a Form to the charm's Magic Resistance. If the bearer has a Magic Resistance of his own, the higher of the two protections, that of the bearer or that of the charm, overrules the other.

### Potions

A potion is a specialized, single-use type of enchantment that affects whatever it is applied to. Manufacturing potions is relatively easy, requiring you to alchemically combine, refine, and distill the magical essence of mundane ingredients. Creating potions requires no vis, and you can often brew several doses of a potion in a single season.

Making a potion involves fully describing an effect, as you do when inventing a spell, and concerns your Lab Total and magic aura. The potion only affects whatever it is applied to, so some spells cannot be duplicated by potions. For instance, an *Unseen Arm* potion is not possible. A potion can never give anyone the ability to cast a spell, nor is it possible to simulate a ritual spell with a potion.

Once you have chosen the effect, you spend a season, add your aura to your Lab Total, and compare the total to the level of the effect. For every 5 points, or fraction thereof, by which you exceed the level, you get one dose of the potion. If your Lab Total is exactly equal to the level, you get one dose. If your Lab Total is less than the level of the effect, and you are not using vis in the potion (see below), the season is wasted in your attempt.

Though it is not required, you may wish to expend raw vis when creating potions. If you want the potion to have the longer of two durations listed for a spell (which is especially important for healing spells), you must put Art-specific vis into each potion just as if you were casting the spell—that is, one pawn per 5 levels of the effect. You may also expend even more Art-specific vis to increase your Lab Total, receiving +5 per pawn used. If vis is used but your Lab Total still doesn't exceed the level of the effect, the season is wasted, and you lose all the vis you used.

When the potion is used, the target undergoes the effects of the spell copied. The effect might not be obvious. For example, a potion that lets the drinker fly has no noticeable effect until the person jumps into the air. The target makes normal magic resistance rolls against the effects of a potion, even if the target wants the potion to affect him.

The term potion refers to any salve, incense, paste, powder, ointment, or similar substance you wish to make; though potions are often in liquid form, they don't have to be. When you create a substance similar to a potion, you have to indicate how the substance is applied—salve is applied to the body of the recipient; dust is sprinkled over the recipient; incense is inhaled by the recipient. The storyguide may give you a bonus to your Lab Total if you choose a form for your substance that's especially suited to the effect it produces.

#### Longevity Potions

Your time to study and increase your power has an ultimate deadline: your inevitable demise. In their attempts to gain themselves more time in this world, the magi of Hermes have developed longevity potions. Though death is still inevitable, these potions can stave off death for a hundred years or more. Magi of two hundred years or older are rare, but not unheard of.

The longevity potion acts as a magical anchor, sustaining the vital life force of the magus, often by directly affecting the tissues of the magus's body. This anchor, however, prevents the magus from expending his life force in normal human fashion, so the magus becomes permanently sterile. Though called a potion, the longevity effect may be imparted through any number of media. Charms, potions, clothes, and tattoos are just some of the possibilities, each one having unique properties. A longevity charm, for example, has to be worn constantly to provide its preserving power; if it were removed, you could die immediately, or you might slowly fade away until the charm was returned or a new longevity "potion" created. A tattoo, on the other hand, might be better, as it is more or less a part of you; it might begin to fade after the longevity "potion" in your system fails, serving as a gauge of your decline.

Every magus has a unique formula for his longevity potion, and the potion that a magus uses for himself is of no benefit to another, though it is possible for a magus to make a longevity potion for another.

The first stage in creating your longevity potion is determining what ingredients you need. You may do this in one season if your Intellego Corpus Lab Total (including your aura) is greater than 20. If it is not, you cannot invent a longevity potion. After determining (and acquiring) the proper ingredients, you merely spend 1 pawn of vis per five

### Longevity Potions

Your time to study and increase your power has an ultimate deadline: your inevitable demise. In the world of Ars Magica, magi can create longevity potions to stave off the effects of aging. A longevity potion is a specialized, single-use type of enchantment that affects whatever it is applied to.

Normally, only Creo, Corpus, and Vim vis may be used in a longevity potion. However, a longevity potion is a very personal creation, and as such, it is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. You may, with the approval of the troupe or storyguide, substitute any type of vis that your magical talents are strongly associated with.

A longevity potion's effect lasts until you actually suffer the ill effects of aging; that is, you develop an affliction, have the score of an existing affliction increase, or gain a Decrepitude point through aging (see "Aging" on [page 180](../page-refs/page-180.md)). After this, the potion loses its effectiveness and a new potion must be brewed. You can invent a new potion (following the normal rules for doing so), or brew a new batch from the old formula. This involves simply making a new investment of vis (of an amount based on your current age) but no significant investment in time. This "replacement" potion may be created using your lab text (see next section) from the previous brewing. If your longevity potion fails and you make aging rolls before you create a new one, you suffer the full effects of your age. You do not gain back any affliction points or Decrepitude points that you suffered when you were not under the effects of a potion when you do finally take one.

When creating a longevity potion for the first time, you can increase its potency by adding extra vis to the brew. This vis is above and beyond that which you must spend for your current age. For each additional pawn you add to the brew, add 1 to your Lab Total. This vis is invested when you originally create a given version of a potion, but you must use the same amount of vis with each new potion of this formula that you make when the previous one fails. If you reinvent the potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, you can choose not to use extra vis. Extra vis spent does not increase your Lab Total to determine if you can create a longevity potion in the first place.

You can make longevity potions for others, even for non-magi. To determine the ingredients for another person's potion, you and that character must spend one season of research and brewing. Your Lab Total (based on Intellego Corpus), plus aura, must equal 30+. Otherwise, you cannot determine what ingredients need to go into the potion. If your score is 30+, you can make the potion and must invest one pawn of vis per five years of the character's current age. A longevity potion made for another magus functions just as if made for you (-1 to aging rolls for every 5 points of Lab Total). Non-magical people, however, are not as resilient as magi. The potion you create for a mundane therefore only subtracts one from the character's aging rolls for every 10 full points in your Lab Total.

## Laboratory Texts

When you instill a power into an enchanted item or create a batch of potions, your work is not forgotten as soon as the enchantment is complete. You create a laboratory text to record your work, and you can use the lab text to help you recreate your work. Lab texts can record the enchantment of devices, the brewing of potions, and the creation of longevity potions. Because of the inflexible, complex nature of enchantments, however, a lab text is not as useful as a spell written out in full. While a written spell aids you in learning a spell and maybe creating other spells with similar effects, a lab text only allows you to duplicate the results of a previous laboratory enterprise.

You should keep a record of your magus's life in the laboratory, so you know what sorts of lab texts you have access to. You must record your Magic Theory score at the time the lab work was done, all the information about the types and amounts of vis used in creating the potion or device, the effects you created or modified, and all game modifiers involved in each step of the creation process. Your magus is assumed to have created lab texts every time he did work in the lab.

In general, a lab text provides a bonus equal to your score in Magic Theory on any further projects you attempt that are of the same type and that produce the same effect as the original. This Magic Theory bonus is equal to your Magic Theory score at the writing of the lab text, not your score when the text is referred to again. If the enchantment recorded in the text is within your Magic Theory specialty, add 1 to the score of the lab text.

If you have a lab text describing how to instill an effect into an item, you get a flat bonus to your Lab Total when instilling that same effect into the same type of item (that is, of the same category on "Form and Effect Bonuses Table"). If you have a lab text describing how to create a batch of potions, you get a bonus to your Lab Total when creating a batch of potions with the same powers. Lab texts that detail longevity potions also give a bonus to the magus's Lab Total, making more recent potions more potent and more helpful to resisting aging. However, a lab text for longevity potions is only useful when recreating a previous batch of potions, though it is still valid if you have to add more vis to the new potion based on your increased age. If you're creating a new potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, previous lab texts are useless because you are creating a whole new formula.

If you create a longevity potion and make a lab text of it, that text is only of use to you. Longevity potions are too personalized for their lab texts to be used for the potions of others. However, if you're creating a longevity potion for another and make a lab text of your work, you can refer to that text when making more potions of the same formula for that individual.

When using a lab text, basic elements of the original project can't change. The type of enchantment (that is, invested or lesser) must remain the same. The form and material of the magic item must remain the same (that is, form and effect bonuses given by the "Form and Effect Bonuses Table" must not change), and if the original power affected the device itself, then so must the duplicated power.

If any vis was used to increase Lab Total when making the original batch of potions or invested power, you must use the same type and amount of vis when using the lab text, but you still gain +5 to your Lab Total per pawn of vis used for that purpose. If you do not use the same vis, you gain no benefit from the lab text.

You can use the lab texts of another magus to reproduce his creations. You gain the bonus of his Magic Theory score at the time he wrote the text. However, reproducing the project of another magus with the aid of another magus's lab text is useless unless your Magic Theory is higher than the Magic Theory of the magus who created the original lab text. When you reproduce another magus's work by referring to his lab text, you create your own lab text. If you do the same project again in the future, you can use either your own lab text, or use the other magus's lab text, not both.

### Translating Laboratory Texts

A magus's lab texts, like notes for spells, are not generally found in a format suitable for others to use. For others to read your notes, you must make a legible copy. You can translate lab texts for a number of projects equal to your Scribe Latin score per season.

In order to use the lab texts of another magus, you must decode that magus's personal writing style and then translate his notes into a form you can use. The whole process takes a season, at the end of which you have the notes for one of the magus's lab projects—his notes on making a certain potion, or investing a certain device. The rules for decoding and translating lab notes are the same for those of spell notes (see "Translating Spells," [page 82](../page-refs/page-82.md)).

### Investigating Enchantments

If you wish to determine the powers of someone else's enchantment, you must investigate it in your lab. You inspect the item's physical construction, investigate the Form and Technique with Intéllego magics, and test to see how the enchantment responds to other magics. All of this indicates how the item was created, what its powers are, and how to unleash them.

You discover the powers in an enchanted device in order from weakest to strongest, that is, from the power of the lowest effect level to that of the highest. (A device's function as a talisman is treated as a level 20 power.) When you investigate an enchantment for the first time, you spend a season, add a stress die to your Intéllego Vim Lab Total, add in your aura, and compare the result to the level of the weakest power in the enchantment. If you succeed in your roll to find the weakest power, you may roll again in that same season to identify the power immediately above it in strength. For example, if a device has three powers of level 10, 20, and 30 and you rolled a Lab Total of 25, you do not automatically find the first two powers. As your rolled Lab Total is over 10 (the level of the first power), you find the first power and may roll again in the season to find the second power (level 20), and the third power if you discover the second. Note that the level of a power in an enchanted device includes any effect modifications that apply to the power (see "Invested Devices," [page 85](../page-refs/page-85.md)).

As long as you succeed in finding powers, you keep rolling to find more in that season. If you roll and find nothing, it either means that there are no more powers in the enchantment or that you did not roll high enough to find the next one. Only the storyguide knows for certain. In either case, you can keep trying as long as you want, but each failure to discover a power ends the rolls for that season, and you can do nothing else that season.

If you botch an investigation roll, many results can arise, and the storyguide makes the final decision based on the situation. You could misinterpret a power, thinking it does something different from its actual function. You could misread the triggering action of a power, making it useless to you. Or you could somehow disturb the enchanted item, setting off its powers. If you survive an investigation botch, your season ends there. However, you may approach the device again next season to properly identify the power that confounded you.

Magi sometimes use the Watching Ward ([see page 160](../page-refs/page-160.md)) to guard their enchanted devices. The spell held in waiting is often released on anyone who magically examines the item. The Watching Ward is not invested into the device, but cast on it for protection. You therefore cannot detect a Watching Ward in your preliminary investigations of an item. If you do not cast a spell to detect a Watching Ward, discovering it often means tripping it. Beware.

## Arcane Experimentation

The preceding enchantment rules assume that you are being careful with your laboratory work and staying safely within the bounds of what you know how to do. If you wish, however, you can test your limits and experiment with new and possibly dangerous techniques. You can experiment when inventing a spell, creating any magical enchantment (device or familiar), creating a potion, or investigating an enchantment. In any case, you have the chance to perform feats that are normally beyond your capabilities, but you also run the risk of failing utterly, perhaps dangerously.

### The Experimental Premise

At the beginning of each season, consider the project you're working on and decide whether you want to experiment on it. If you do experiment, add a simple die roll to your Lab Total. This bonus represents the fruits of the risks you take. However, you must also roll a stress die on the "Extraordinary Results Chart" for each season that the project involves. If you experiment over multiple seasons, inventing the same spell or instilling the same power in a device, the chart results for each season accumulate and apply to the whole project. For example, if it takes two seasons to invest a power into your staff, you have to make a roll on the chart each season. Both results affect the staff or the power you're investing into it.

### Exceptional Risk

You may choose to push your limits even further, adding from +1 to +3 (your choice) to the die roll; this bonus is called your risk modifier. When you do this, you must add the risk modifier to all your rolls on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," and you get a number of extra botch dice on your rolls equal to your bonus.

### Extraordinary Results

Some of the results listed on the "Extraordinary Result Chart" require some interpretation. When interpreting these results, consider the magus's sigil, specialties, and weaknesses. Also take into account the type of spell or power being worked on, and the Laws of Magic. The more aspects of magic that you bring together, the more interesting the result is.

When referring to the "Extraordinary Results Chart," roll a stress die, adding your risk modifier (if any). If you roll a 0, roll one botch die, plus a number of botch dice equal to your risk modifier. You also get one additional botch die for each point in your magic aura.

#### Inventing a Spell by Experimentation

Points from the simple die, added to your Lab Total, might let you finish a spell sooner, or even invent a spell that is otherwise beyond your capacity. If your spell comes out flawed or difficult to cast because of your roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," you have two choices: live with the anomaly, or reinvent the spell. If you reinvent it, use the normal spell invention rules. However, you gain your Magic Theory score (your score at the time of your experiment) as a bonus to your roll to accomplish the invention, having learned something from your nearly successful experiment. Thus, your Magic Theory score is applied twice to your reinventing Lab Total. The reinvention process must occur in another season.

If even with the added simple die your Lab Total is still lower than the spell's level, you cannot invent the spell, and must still make a roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart." Even though your experiment fails, it can still blow up in your face. Having failed to invent the spell, you may try again next season, and may experiment again.

#### Invested Devices Created by Experimentation

Even with the added bonus of a simple die, your Lab Total may not meet the level of the effect you're investing. In that case, you lose all the vis involved and must still roll on the "Extraordinary Effects Chart." You may try again next season, though, and may experiment again.

If your Lab Total is high enough to invest an effect, but the effect turns out to be flawed (as determined by a roll on the chart), it still "takes up space" in your device, just like a normal effect. Even if you can get the flawed effect out of your device, it still denies you the points of vis it "occupied" in the item. Thus, if you risk experimentation and make a mistake, you can permanently limit the effectiveness of your magical item.

#### Enchanting a Familiar by Experimentation

When enchanting a familiar (see "Familiars," [page 94](../page-refs/page-94.md)), you add the simple die to the strength of the bond you create, thus increasing both the number of points from which you purchase ratings in the cords and the number of levels of powers exchanged. Any results from the "Extraordinary Results Chart" are applied to all the powers you grant and all that you receive. The troupe may choose to have you roll separately on the chart for each power exchanged, or may apply the results of a single roll to all powers exchanged. Powers that are gained but altered by the chart cannot be changed or revoked.

#### Inventing Potions by Experimentation

Even with the help of experimentation, your Lab Total may not exceed the level of the spell being invested into a potion. In that case, you fail to produce the potion, lose any vis used, waste a season, and must still roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart."

If the potion's invention succeeds but comes out flawed according to your roll on the chart, you may attempt to create the potion again by normal means another season. Your Magic Theory score (that at the time of your experiment) is used as a bonus to your attempt to reinvent the potion, as you have learned from your nearly successful experiment. Thus, your Magic Theory is applied twice to your Lab Total for reinventing the potion.

You may also experiment on longevity potions, adding the simple die to your Lab Total. This bonus increases the potency of your potion, giving you greater resilience against the affects of aging. If your potion is flawed by a roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," you may recreate your potion next season and add your Magic Theory score as a bonus to your Lab Total for that potion (thus Magic Theory is applied twice to Lab Total).

#### Investigating an Enchanted Item by Experimentation

The simple die is added to every roll made to discover an item's invested powers. If you cannot bring your Lab Total high enough to discover an item's powers, you still have to roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," though.

When investigating an enchanted item by experimenting on it, you take risks not normally taken, and may damage or destroy the magic item in the process. Any results from the chart indicating damage or changes to the project you are working on are applied to the magic item or one of its powers. It's possible, though, that a magic item's own protections can preserve it from the dangers of your experiments. If the level of an item's protecting power (like Magic Resistance or an appropriate spell) exceeds your Lab Total (including any bonus for experimentation), the item resists any damaging effects rolled on the chart.

### Extraordinary Results Chart

| Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
| Botch | **Disaster** |
| 0-3 | **Complete failure** |
| 4-5 | **No benefit** |
| 6-7 | **No extraordinary effects** |
| 8 | **Side effect** |
| 9 | **Special or story event** |
| 10 | **Discovery** |
| 11 | **Modified effect** |
| 12+ | Roll twice more on this chart. |

**Disaster**: You fail miserably. Roll a simple die + risk modifier – Perception, and compare to the following chart.

| Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
| 0 or less | You spot the disaster before it occurs. Your season is still wasted; see **Complete Failure**.  |
| 1-2 | Your creation is destroyed.  |
| 3-4 | Your creation is destroyed, and so is some other valuable item that you keep in your laboratory.  |
| 5-6 | Explosion! You lab equipment is ruined, and you must roll a simple die for each valuable possession you keep in your lab. On a 0, it is destroyed. You take an amount of damage equal to a simple die + the level of the spell or effect you were working on.  |
| 7-8 | Your experiment backfires in such a way that the entire covenant is threatened, either through fire, the summoning of a major threat, or some other calamity the storyguide makes up.  |
| 9-10 | You enter Wizard's Twilight. Add the magnitude of the spell or power you were working with to the local aura to determine the strength of the supernatural power you must control.  |
| 11+ | Roll twice more on this chart.  |

**Complete Failure**: You get nothing from your efforts, and your season is wasted. If you were working on a familiar or enchanted item, roll a simple die. On a 0, it is destroyed.

**No Benefit**: Your experimentation produces no results. You lose the benefit of the extra die and risk modifier—recalculate your Lab Total without those modifiers. If your new Lab Total is too low to succeed in the project, it must be abandoned.

**No Extraordinary Effects**: Your experiment works without producing any unintended effects.

**Side Effect**: Your magical creation acquires a side effect. Roll a simple die, and work out the specifics with the storyguide.

| Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Your sigil is exaggerated to many times its normal strength, becoming a significant portion of the effect.  |
| 2-3 | The effect has a minor flaw. For example, a spell that allows you to communicate with animals causes you to retain some of the animal's speech patterns for a time after the spell ends.  |
| 4-5 | The spell has a minor side effect. For example, a spell that controls an animal causes grass to grow under its feet.  |
| 6 | The spell has a minor side benefit. For example, a wind spell has a pleasant smell and makes flying insects uncomfortable.  |
| 7 | The spell has a major flaw. For example, a healing spell causes its targets great pain.  |
| 8 | The spell has a major side effect. For example, a plant control spell attracts all birds in 100 paces.  |
| 9 | The spell has a major side benefit. For example, a spell that transforms you into a wolf also lets you speak to all beasts while a wolf.  |
| 10 | The spell has a fatal flaw. For example, an invisibility spell makes you glow.  |

**Special or Story Event**: Either some effect not covered elsewhere occurs, or, at the storyguide's option, an event unfolds as a result of your work which involves the entire covenant.

**Discovery**: Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier.

| Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
| 1-4 | You gain three experience points in Magic Theory.  |
| 5-6 | You gain three experience points in some Arcane Ability or Mental Skill related to the experiment.  |
| 7-8 | You gain three experience points in one of the Arts used in the experiment.  |
| 9 | You gain enough experience points to bring one of the Arts used in the experiment to the next level (or three experience points, whichever is greater).  |
| 10+ | Roll twice, and reroll this result if it is generated again.  |

**Modified Effect**: Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier. If you were investigating a magic item, you have changed one or more of its powers.

| Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
| 1-3 | The spell or effect is reduced in range, duration, target, or potency.  |
| 4-6 | The spell or effect's range, duration, target, or potency is increased.  |
| 7-8 | The use of the spell or effect is restricted. For example, it fails to work in certain circumstances, like when it is raining.  |
| 9-10 | The actual effect of your experiment is modified. For example, a spell like *Curse of Circe* ([page 125](../page-refs/page-125.md)) turns the target into a goat instead of a pig.  |
| 11+ | The actual effect of your experiment is changed completely, save that the relevant Technique and Form remain unchanged, and the level remains similar.  |

## The Laboratory in Play

Laboratory activities take up most of your life as a magus, so you should take some care in deciding both your individual laboratory activities and your attitude towards your laboratory and your creations. Your laboratory itself is an important reflection of your personality, as it is where you spend much of your time. Take the time to think about what your sanctum looks like and what's in it. Does it bear protective spells? Where do you sleep? What do you have in your lab, and where do you keep it? Do you hide your most prized possessions? Is your laboratory clean and well kept, or a disorganized mess where no one but you can find anything? Answering such questions helps you define your magus, and is usually fun to boot.

## Multiple Laboratory Activities

Sometimes you may wish to perform laboratory activities that, though rewarding, are well within your capabilities and do not each require an entire season of effort. In this case, you may choose to perform multiple activities within the same season, splitting your time among them all. All the activities you perform in a season must be of the same type (learning spells, instilling powers in an invested device, creating potions) and must use the same Technique and Form. To perform multiple activities, simply add up the levels of all activities performed and apply your Lab Total to the total of the levels.

If you perform arcane experimentation, you add a single simple die + risk modifier to your Lab Total, but any results rolled on the "Extraordinary Results Chart" apply to all activities performed in the season.

## Help in the Lab

Though the Code of Hermes provides protection for magi who meet on neutral grounds, the sanctum of a magus (laboratory and living quarters) is a special place in which magi hold their greatest treasures and deepest secrets. Thus, the Code of Hermes allows for magi to exact any toll on magi who trespass within their sancta. Because one magus foregoes protection of the Code when in the laboratory

## Help in the Lab

Though the Code of Hermes provides protection for magi who meet on neutral grounds, the sanctum of another, very few magi ever cooperate in laboratory work.

Nevertheless, there are times when magi receive help in their laboratory work, either from trusting magi or from apprentices. Anyone who has the Gift, Hermetic training (a Magic Theory score), and a positive Intelligence may help you to study Arts or Magic Theory from vis, or to perform any activity that uses your Magic Theory. If you are being helped to perform some activity that uses your Magic Theory, you add the helper's Magic Theory + Intelligence to your Lab Total for the season. If you are studying from vis, you add +1 to your studying roll for the season. If the assistant has some appropriate Virtue, like Inventive Genius, that Virtue affects the primary researcher's efforts, adding to his scores and rolls in the lab.

Thus, when two magi cooperate, one must always be the primary researcher and one must be the assistant. Even if magi are not in danger of attack from one another, very few are willing to spend a season in the role of lab assistant: the Hermetic social implications are unconscionable.

You may not normally have more than one helper in the lab, as it is difficult to coordinate several helpers with you and with each other. However, if people are exceptionally well-organized and cooperative, more can work together, each helper adding his Magic Theory and Intelligence scores to the primary researcher's scores. The total number of assistants that the primary researcher can make use of in one season is limited to his Leadership score (though he can always have at least one).

Lab assistants do not gain anything from the experience (that is, they do not gain experience in any Arts studied, nor do not learn newly researched spells).

## Distractions from Studies

The rules for what a magus can do in a season assume that the season is uninterrupted. Sometimes, however, magi take time away from their labs to travel and explore, and this lost time makes itself felt in their lab performance.

You may miss up to ten days from any laboratory activity, and make up the time by working harder during the remainder of the season. There is no penalty for this. However, your Lab Total is reduced by 1 for each day over ten that you miss, or, if you are studying, the Quality of the source you are studying from counts as though it were one level lower for every two days over ten that you miss.

If the procedure you are performing requires a full season, such as performing multiple tasks of the same kind, any interruption of more than ten days ruins the procedure, and any vis you have expended in the season is lost.
