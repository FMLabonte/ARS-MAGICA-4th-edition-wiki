# Familiars

Protective of their secrets and suspicious of any who might hold power over them, magi are notoriously distant from other people. They can find some companionship with apprentices, but the master-apprentice bond atrophies after the apprentice becomes a magus, and sometimes former master and former apprentice become rivals. For longer-lasting and deeper companionship, many magi turn to familiars.

A familiar is a beast that a magus befriends and then magically bonds with, instilling the beast with magical powers in the process and then using magic to merge its powers and abilities with his own. Though a familiar is very close to the magus who creates it, it always has its own will, and is not under the control of the magus. The familiar is the closest friend and ally a magus will ever have . . . but even friends fight occasionally.

## Finding and Befriending an Animal

The first step in getting a familiar is finding an animal with inherent magic. With inherent magic, the beast is likely to have a Magic Might score, which may be assigned based on comparable scores of other magical creatures. The means of finding such a creature are ultimately left to the storyguide to determine. Wandering at random in search of a magical creature is usually profitless—magi generally follow rumors to the locations of the familiars they want. Some receive visions of animals that are somehow "meant" for them.

Once found, the animal must be befriended. You must genuinely admire or even love the animal in question, and it must trust you freely, under no coercion, magical or mundane. The animal can sense something of your nature when you are in close contact. If your natures clash, it rejects you. The need for mutual admiration between magus and familiar is why air magi, for example, often take birds as familiars, and why you can often tell something about magi by the familiars they have chosen and that have chosen them.

## Enchanting the Familiar

Once you and the familiar accept each other, you take the animal to your laboratory and begin a year-long series of enchantments. Any serious distractions from these enchantments ruins them and forces you to start over from the beginning. Enchanting a familiar is different from other enchantments. The bond between you and your familiar causes changes to you both, and you do not have full control over how the enchantment affects you. Your troupe and storyguide determine how you are affected throughout the enchantment, though you do have control over the changes your familiar undergoes.

### The First Season

#### Opening the Enchantment

The first season of the year-long enchantment is spent attuning the animal's magic to your own. It requires a number of pawns of Vim vis equal to (12 + the creature's size). You also need to have an Animal score of 10 or better to perfect this harmonization.

During this season, the animal often undergoes physical changes, such as a change in hue, shape of limbs, or texture of skin. It also learns rudimentary speech that you, at least, can understand. It may develop a speech trait to match one of yours, and it may acquire Personality Traits that match yours.

Similarly, you may take on some habits and minor physical and mental characteristics of the animal. For example, a magus with a crow familiar might wipe his face on his shoulder in emulation of the bird's feather-preening. You may wish to take a positive score in a Personality Trait that matches the type of animal you are enchanting (for example, "Raven +2").

### The Second Season

#### Strength of the Bond

In the second season the bond is secured. At this time you calculate your bond score, which is equal to your Animal + Mentem + Intellego – the animal's Magic Resistance and Size. You may also add any applicable affinities you have. Your bond score is the total used to purchase cord scores, which are discussed in the following section. It is also used to purchase bond qualities (which are similar in concept to Virtues and Flaws) between magus and familiar, which manifest during the third season of the bonding process.

#### Forging the Three Cords

Part of the second season's bonding involves forging three mystic cords that connect you and the familiar. A golden cord connects your magical abilities, a silver cord connects your minds, and a bronze cord connects your bodies. These cords may be seen by someone with the Second Sight Virtue, but they are otherwise imperceptible.

The strength of each of these cords is rated from 0 to +3. To determine all the cords' ratings, divide the points of your bond score among them however you choose and then use the points allocated to each to buy cord scores. A cord strength of 0 costs nothing, a strength of +1 requires 5 points, a score of +2 requires 15 points, and a score of +3 requires 30 points. The total cost of the cords you buy cannot exceed your bond score.

Each cord has a varying effect (described below) depending on how well it is forged. Regardless of the strength, however, effects apply only when the familiar is within 100 paces of you. On the positive side, these benefits also apply to the familiar.

**The Golden Cord**: The familiar helps you avoid magical errors, letting you roll fewer botch rolls when using magic. Your golden cord score is the number subtracted from the number of botch rolls you would normally make (though you must always roll at least one).

**The Silver Cord**: You can apply your silver cord score as a bonus to all rolls that involve Personality Traits, to natural resistance rolls against mental magic, and to rolls to protect you from a natural mental influence like intimidation or verbal trickery. In addition, if your mind is ever overcome by another force your familiar may be able to free you. To be successful, it must roll 9+ on a stress die with the silver cord score as its bonus (one attempt per day). If the roll botches, the animal's mind is overcome along with yours.

**The Bronze Cord**: You can apply your bronze cord score as a bonus to Soak rolls, to healing rolls, and to rolls to withstand deprivation (such as to holding your breath or resisting sleepiness). It does not help you withstand Fatigue.

### The Third Season

#### Tempering the Bond

In the third season, you strengthen the bond between you and your familiar by evoking certain magical powers through the bond. These are abilities you and your familiar manifest together. You choose what qualities you wish to evoke. See "Bond Qualities," below, for the powers you may choose from. You and the storyguide then decide how those particular qualities affect you and your familiar.

You have a number of points equal to your full bond score to buy bond qualities. Negative bond qualities provide you with additional points for purchasing positive bond qualities, just like Flaws provide extra points for Virtue purchase.

Almost all bond qualities affect both you and your familiar in some related way; they characterize your bond. By choosing bond qualities you are determining how the physical, mental, and magical qualities of each of you affect the other. In addition, almost all bond qualities are accompanied by the exchange of some minor physical, mental, or (rarely) magical quirk or habit related to a particular bond characteristic. For example, if you choose a bond characteristic that increases your awareness of each other, then you might each gain some minor habit linked to each other's special sensory strengths: for example, a magus with a dog familiar may sniff people when he first meets them, whereas the dog scrutinizes the text of signs and book covers.

You and the storyguide must agree on all changes that you and a familiar undergo during the formation of the bond. There are several factors you can consider to choose these changes. Perhaps your magic Arts indicate the type of powers the familiar receives. Perhaps the qualities you receive from your familiar are based on the beast's abilities, either natural abilities, such as a cat's ability to see in the dark, or on any natural magical Powers the beast may have possessed before it became your familiar.

See "Bond Qualities" for powers you and your familiar may share. The qualities listed can be considered guidelines, and you may create any new bond quality you like, provided it works similarly to those shown and you get the storyguide's approval. Some tales tell of magi who invest familiars with superior powers and abilities by actually reducing their own powers and abilities. However, the nature of the bond between familiar and magus requires that the magus gain something in return, though the boon gained to offset a given loss of ability may be subtle.

### The Fourth Season

#### Closing the Enchantment

In the fourth season of the familiar's enchantment, you simultaneously complete the enchantment and close it so that it cannot be dispelled, which takes another three pawns of Vim vis. From then on, you have a familiar, independent but loyal. At this point, determine the remaining statistics for your familiar.

## Bond Qualities

You may never take the same quality more than once, unless the description says you can. If a quality is noted as "ranged," it applies when magus and familiar are within 100 paces of each other unless the specific quality states otherwise. You may not take bond qualities that are incompatible or that overlap in their scope. The storyguide has final judgment on which bond qualities can be taken together.

### +5 Bond Qualities

**Attunement**: You may attune one of your familiar's natural magical powers to Hermetic magic. You must do this for all your familiar's natural magical powers (5 points each time) before you can choose any other bond qualities.

**Awareness**: Ranged. Each of you always knows where the other is, in terms of both direction and approximate distance. You each gain one habit or quirk from the other related to your particular sensory strengths (see "Tempering the Bond").

**Exchange Virtues**: Your familiar gains one of your Virtues, and you gain a Virtue related to one of the familiar's natural abilities, or to one of the natural magical Powers that it had before becoming your familiar. Note that you do not lose the Virtue that you exchanged for another.

**Extended Bond**: The powers of your bond, including the powers of the three cords and all ranged bond qualities, work when the two of you are within one mile of each other, not just within 100 paces.

**Linked Targets**: Ranged. Whenever either of you is affected by magic, either beneficial or hostile, the other is fully affected as well.

**Material Bond**: Your familiar gains +1 in a physical Characteristic (Strength, Stamina, Presence, Dexterity, Quickness) that you have that is higher than your familiar's, and you gain +1 in a physical Characteristic that your familiar has that is higher than yours. You choose the Characteristics to be exchanged. If you cannot each contribute a Characteristic to the other (for instance, because all your familiar's Characteristics are lower than yours), you cannot take this bond quality. You can take this quality multiple times, but your Characteristic scores may be raised to no higher than +7 in this manner. Along with this bond quality, you each gain some physical appearance trait of the other.

**Mental Bond**: Your familiar gains +1 in a nonphysical Characteristic (Intelligence, Perception, Communication) that you have that is higher than your familiar's, and you gain +1 in a nonphysical Characteristic that your familiar has that is higher than yours.

You choose the Characteristics to be exchanged. If you cannot each contribute a Characteristic to the other (for instance, because all your familiar's Characteristics are lower than yours), you cannot take this bond quality. You can take this quality multiple times, but your Characteristic scores may be raised to no higher than +7 in this manner. Along with this bond quality, you each gain some mental trait, habit, or Personality Trait of the other.

**Primary Power**: Your familiar gains a new magical power related to your strongest magical Art, and you gain 2 levels in the magical Art most closely related to the familiar's strongest natural magical power (or its strongest natural ability if it has no natural magical powers). If the power the familiar gains affects the familiar only, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 10 or less, and it will cost the familiar 2 points of Magic Might to use; if the power allows the familiar to affect other things, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 10 or less, and it will cost the familiar 3 points of Magic Might to use. If the familiar has no Magic Might score, it can use the above powers three times a day and twice per day, respectively.

**Shared Ability**: You each either gain one Ability that the other possesses and gain it at the same score, or increase to that of the other's score a score in an Ability you already possess. Thus, one of you could gain a new Ability and the other increase one, each of you could increase a separate Ability that you both share at different scores, or both of you could gain a new Ability. You may take this bond quality more than once, each time sharing and/or increasing new Abilities. You each also gain one habit of the other, related somehow to the Ability score gained.

**Shared Languages**: Your familiar's speech becomes intelligible to people other than you (but is still poor). Your familiar only knows how to speak Latin or your native language—your choice. Likewise, you may speak with beasts of the same species as your familiar (for example, wolves, ravens, moles, deer). You each also gain some speech habit of the other.

**Shared Protection**: Ranged. The two of you are protected by each other's Magic Resistance, both getting the better of the two protections. Your familiar does not control your Parma Magica, but receives its benefits whenever you activate the defense. You each also gain a defensive habit of the other. This habit has no rule implications; it's just a tendency, like an instinct to immediately seek out shelter.

**Sympathetic Emotions**: When either of you feels an emotion, the other feels it too. Whenever one of you makes a Personality Trait roll the other gains the benefits or suffers the same effects of the Trait. Your familiar gains 1 Confidence point and you gain your familiar's strongest Personality Trait at the same level it has.

### +10 Bond Qualities

**Mental Communication**: Ranged. The two of you may communicate mentally with each other at will, sharing thoughts, images, and simple emotions. You each gain a Personality Trait of the other.

**Secondary Power**: Your familiar gains a new magical power related to any magical Art you wish, and you gain 4 levels in a magical Art closely related to one of the familiar's natural abilities or natural magical powers. If the power the familiar gains affects the familiar only, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 15 or less, and it will cost the familiar 1 point of Magic Might to use; if the power allows the familiar to affect other things, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 15 or less, and it will cost the familiar 2 points of Magic Might to use. If the familiar has no Magic Might score, the above powers it gains can be used four times a day or three times a day, respectively.

**Shared Senses**: Ranged. Each of you can use any one of the other's senses by making a Perception + Concentration simple roll of 9+, but you cannot both use this ability simultaneously. The one of you using the sense of the other cannot perceive his surroundings with the sense being borrowed, as it is being overridden. Anything that breaks the concentration of the one of you using this ability ends the ability's use. You each also gain some habit of the other, related to the other's particular sensory strengths (see "Tempering the Bond").

**Shared Speech**: Your familiar's speech becomes as good as human speech, completely clear and intelligible to people other than you. Your familiar knows all the human languages that you do. You may speak with all beasts that share the same general habitat (land, air, water, or underground) as your familiar. You each also gain a strong speech habit of the other, or your voices change completely.

**Transfer Fatigue**: Ranged. You may each take a Fatigue level for the other. The one that transfers the Fatigue level may not use this ability again until the recipient recovers his Fatigue level, though the recipient may use this ability at a later time to transfer a Fatigue level in the other direction. If transfer of the Fatigue level would knock the recipient unconscious, the transfer fails. You each also gain some sleeping habit of the other.

**Unlimited Bond**: The powers of your bond, including the powers of the three cords and all ranged bond qualities, work at any range.

### +15 Bond Qualities

**Shapechange**: Your familiar can shapechange into human form, and with an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+, you can shapechange into the form of the familiar's species. The familiar must expend 5 points of Magic Might to change, and you must expend a Fatigue level. (If your familiar has no Magic Might score, it must also expend a Fatigue level to change shape.) For each hour shapechanged, one who is shapechanged must make a Fatigue roll against an ease factor of 9. If the roll fails, he loses a Fatigue level and resumes normal form. One rendered unconscious, for whatever reason, the shapechanged individual resumes normal form. You each also gain one physical peculiarity of the other, which is very noticeable.

**Shared Magic**: Ranged. Your familiar gains a limited ability to use magic in your strongest Art, and you gain a limited ability to use one of the familiar's natural abilities or natural magical Powers. Your familiar may cast level 5 spontaneous spells related to your strongest Art, at the cost of 1 point of Magic Might each (or at the cost of a Fatigue level if the animal has no Magic Might score). You may, with an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+, use a specified power or natural ability of the familiar, at the cost of one Fatigue level per use.

**Transfer Wounds**: Ranged. You may each mystically take a wound for the other. Calculate damage normally. The amount exceeding the Soak score of the one receiving it is sent to the other. The one that transfers a wound cannot use this ability again until the recipient permanently heals the damage sent (so the damage cannot be healed simply through a temporary spell), though the recipient may use this power at a later time to transfer a wound in the other direction. If transfer of a wound would kill the recipient, the transfer fails.

### -5 Bond Qualities

**Exchange Flaws**: Your familiar gains one of your Flaws, and you gain a Flaw related to one of the familiar's natural or supernatural weaknesses.

**Independence**: Your familiar is unusually independent. It frequently acts of its own accord, even if you prefer otherwise, though you and your familiar always band together in times of need.

**Limited Bond**: The two of you gain most benefits of your bond only when you are close to each other. Any positive bond qualities marked as "ranged" are only in effect when the two of you are within 5 paces of each other. Negative bond qualities with a range still function within 100 paces.

### –10 Bond Qualities

**At Odds**: The two of you clash with on a regular basis, bickering and arguing, occasionally to the point where you refuse to speak to each other. The two of you may purposefully work against each other in many cases, but you always join together fiercely in times of need (take a "Loyalty to Familiar +3" Personality Trait). Also, you each gain one debate tactic or other mental tactic of the other.

**Tight Bond**: The two of you gain most benefits of your bond only when you are touching. Any positive bond qualities marked as "ranged" are only in effect when you are touching. You each gain some physical skin trait of the other.

**Sympathetic Fatigue**: Ranged. When either of the two of you is Fatigued, the other must make a stress Fatigue roll of 6+, or lose a Fatigue level (two levels on a botch). The two of you almost always sleep together.

**Sympathetic Pain**: Ranged. When either of the two of you is wounded or in pain, the other feels pain as well. For the round following that in which the original wound is inflicted, both of you suffer the wound penalty inflicted. If one of you is already at a lower Body level than the other, his lesser wounds have no effect on the other. You each also gain a muscular reflex action of the other, probably one associated with pain.

**Sympathetic Wounds**: Ranged. When either of you is wounded (that is, takes a Body level of damage), the other must make a Stamina + Size stress roll of 6+, or be wounded for the same amount. If you botch the roll, you suffer an additional Body level of damage. You each gain one of the other's instinctive fears (fear of spiders, snakes, fire, certain predators). Take a Flaw or Personality Trait of +3 in the appropriate fear.

## The Familiar as a Character

Your familiar retains any of the natural abilities it had before it became your familiar, but you must be sure you attuned all of its magical powers to Hermetic magic. If you don't have enough points to attune all your familiar's magical Powers, those unaccounted for are lost when the animal undergoes the closing ritual.

Your familiar's Intelligence is now only one point lower than yours (assuming it had animal intelligence before). If the creature had higher than animal Intelligence before meeting you, it retains that Intelligence after becoming bound to you. However, even with one less Intelligence point than you, your familiar may be more intelligent than you in performing certain tasks, like predicting the weather without using magic.

Your familiar should have Personality Traits appropriate to its bestial ways, either selected by you or selected by whoever introduces the beast to the saga. Most familiars also have a quirk or two, such as a penchant for recalling irrelevant details or an obsessive delight in the color blue.

Your familiar's speech is only intelligible to you, unless you choose bond qualities that state otherwise.

The familiar uses your Forms or its own Magic Resistance, whichever is better, to resist spells. It can use a Parma Magica if you grant it one, but not in conjunction with its own Magic Resistance. You each are able to circumvent the other's Magic Resistance at will.

## The Familiar in Play

You and your familiar will undoubtedly grow closer as the saga progresses, learning from each other and strengthening your common bond. Over the years, your familiar learns what you know, provided that you keep the familiar with you when you study and that you share your knowledge with it.

At any time during the saga, you may spend a season re-tempering your bond, which allows you to add new positive bond qualities if your total for determining your bond score has increased. The total that may be added is the difference between your new score and you old one. In no case may you increase the strength of the cords, however, and you may never change a bond quality that you have already established. Re-tempering the bond costs three Vim vis, as the bond is closed again.

At the end of any story, the storyguide may choose to award you a new bond quality (good or bad). This usually results if you and your familiar grew closer together during the story, often a result of your accomplishing some important goal through the use of your bond, or a result of having survived a hardship together. The storyguide may choose to give you one good bond quality and one bad bond quality that balance out each other.

Your familiar ages along with you, generally dying a few days before or several weeks after you. The sudden death of your familiar is a warning of immediate danger. Should you ever die while your familiar remains alive, your familiar will experience a shock that may kill it, and even if it lives, it is reduced to a pathetic, devastated condition ever after. Likewise, if you survive your familiar, you may feel a profound emptiness in your life that may last for months, or even years. Having a familiar is a personal, private thing, so only those more concerned with status than true companionship use their familiars as status symbols. You should hold the same level of protectiveness for your familiar that you would for a spouse.

You can only have one familiar at a time. Your familiar will be with you for a long time, so make it interesting.
