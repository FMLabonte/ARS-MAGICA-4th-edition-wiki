# Casting Spells

Most magi find themselves casting many spells. Spells are the actual magical manifestations that magi create when they use the Arts they know. You know all the spells you choose when creating a magus, and come to know more by learning or inventing them during the course of the saga.

Spells are rated by levels, according to their power. Spells of greater power have a greater level. Magi refer to spell levels by using the word magnitude (magi do not use the term level), and one order of magnitude encompasses five levels of spells. Spells of the first magnitude, therefore, are those spells of levels 1-5.

## Types of Magic

Hermetic spells are divided into two types: spontaneous and formulaic. Both draw upon mastery of the magical Arts and use magical words and gestures to obtain a supernatural effect.

### Spontaneous Magic

With spontaneous spells, you combine words and gestures you think will produce a desired magical effect on the spot, taking into account the diverse circumstances affecting the spell, such as time of day, astrological correspondences, and the specific shape and size of the target. Spontaneous magic is therefore flexible but unpredictable. Spontaneous magic is also quite limited in duration and scope.

### Formulaic Magic

When using formulaic magic, you repeat magical formulae that almost always have a given effect and that are applicable under more general circumstances. Formulaic magic is more powerful than spontaneous magic, but much less flexible as you may not change a formula in any way when casting it (though some formulas allow for the extension of range and duration). Unlike spontaneous magic, formulaic magic can produce long-lasting, and even permanent effects.

### Ritual Magic

Formulaic magic encompasses ritual magic, which involves very complex ceremonies and the use of raw vis to produce effects more long-lasting or powerful, or of greater range or scope, than are possible with spontaneous or basic formulaic magic. Ritual magic is more powerful than normal formulaic magic, but just as inflexible, and more expensive in terms of time, effort, and magical resources.

## Casting Spontaneous Spells

You can create original spontaneous spells to fit a nearly unlimited range of situations, because you decide what effect to attempt and then invent a spell on the spur of the moment to achieve that effect. To determine the results of a spontaneous spell, you and the storyguide first determine the Technique and Form that are appropriate for the feat being attempted. Then, you decide if you wish to expend a Fatigue level in order to increase the power of the spell. If you choose to Fatigue yourself you are pushing your limits—you must roll a stress die whether you are in a stressful situation or not. If you do not Fatigue yourself, you roll either a stress or simple die depending upon whether there could be an immediate harmful result if you do not cast the spell.

Once you have made those determinations, roll the appropriate die, add the appropriate Technique and Form, your Intelligence, and Encumbrance. Divide this total by two if you elected to expend a Fatigue level, and divide it by five if you did not. The final result is the level of the spell that you have cast.

Refer to the guidelines for the Technique/Form combination you used (in the Spells chapter) to determine whether your spell is of high enough level to have the effect you desire. If it is too low, a lesser effect may still occur, if relevant, based on the level you did manage to attain. If your result was zero or lower, there is no spell and therefore no effect. Unless you specify otherwise, the effect that you produce will have the default range, duration, and target for the Art combination you are using. (These defaults are listed for each combination in the Spells chapter.) If you do specify otherwise, see “Ranges, Durations, Targets” on [page 103](../page-refs/page-103.md) to determine how changing those parameters changes the level of the spell.

For example, a magus comes upon a small stream with a rocky bank. The magus doesn’t wish to get his feet and robes wet crossing the stream, so contrives to cause some of the rocks to arrange themselves as stepping stones across the stream. He knows no formulaic spell that will do this, so decides to try a spontaneous one. The appropriate arts are Rego (because he wants to move something) and Terram (because he is moving rocks). His relevant Arts are 10 and 6, respectively, and his Intelligence is +3. He is not encumbered. He decides that the success of this spell is not extremely important, so elects not to fatigue himself. As the situation is not stressful, he rolls a simple die, getting a 7. His total, then, is 10 (Rego) + 6 (Terram) + 3 (Intelligence) + 7 (his roll) = 26. He divides by 5 (because he didn’t fatigue himself), generating a spell of level 5. Checking the Rego Terram guidelines in the spell chapter, we can see that he has just been able to move a Small amount of dirt. He has not succeeded in moving the stones as he wanted, but nevertheless, a handful of nearby sand scatters itself sympathetically across the path he desired for the stones.

Had the magus elected to fatigue himself, the total, 26, would have been divided by 2, for a total level of 13. He is able to move a Small amount of rock (probably constituting one of the stones he hoped to move) into position.

If you have a formulaic spell in your repertoire that produces effects similar to those you are trying to produce with a spontaneous spell, you can get a bonus on your spontaneous spell roll by spending one full minute considering the similarities between the effects of the formulaic and spontaneous spell. The bonus is equal to the magnitude of the similar spell. See **Similar Spells**, below. If you are at all disturbed during the period of contemplation, an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 6+ is required to maintain contemplation. Otherwise, you fail to pin down the similarities between your spell and a formulaic one, and receive no spell roll bonus.

### Similar Spells

When casting spontaneous spells, it is helpful to know a formulaic spell that produces a similar effect to the one you are attempting. For two spells to be similar, they may only differ from each other in one of the following ways.

- The range, duration, and target are different.
- The details of the effect are slightly different. For example, one of the spells produces something of a slightly different shape, or moves in a slightly different way.
- The learning or casting requisites are different.
- The two spells have different restrictions. For example, one of the spells requires an arcane connection or a certain material component.
- The strength of the effect is different. For example, one of the spells does a different amount of damage, or produces a different intensity of light.
- The type of target is different. For example, one targets people and the other targets animals, or one targets stone and the other targets metal.

If the two spells fall into more than one of the categories listed, they are not similar.

## Casting a Formulaic Spell

To cast a formulaic spell, your character recites magic words in a firm voice and boldly executes arcane hand gestures memorized as part of the spell. This activity shapes and directs the magical energy that pervades the world.

When casting formulaic spells, the die rolled is a stress die if you are in stressful circumstances or a simple die otherwise. Add the appropriate type of die, the appropriate Technique and Form, your Stamina, and your Encumbrance. If this total is greater than the level of spell you are attempting, the spell is cast successfully and you lose no fatigue. If the total is between the spell level and the spell level minus 10, it is successfully cast but you lose one Fatigue level. If the total is lower than the spell level minus 10, the spell does not take effect and you lose a Fatigue level.

When you successfully cast a spell, make sure that you remember what your roll was, because it might be used immediately to see if you overcome the target’s Magic Resistance (see **Magic Resistance** on [page 72](../page-refs/page-72.md)).

## Casting Ritual Spells

Ritual spells require much more energy and concentration than standard spells, and thus the process of casting them is different. These spells perform major feats, exceeding some of the limits of formulaic and spontaneous spells.

Formulaic and spontaneous spells are normally limited in the following ways:

- They cannot affect an area larger than you can see (though the effects may move out of your sight and control once a spell is cast).
- Their duration cannot be longer than one month.
- They cannot be used to perceive anything in the past or future.

Ritual spells can surpass these limits, creating farther-reaching and longer-lasting effects. Formulaic spells may only surpass the limits on duration and range, and only through the use of raw vis. Spontaneous spells cannot exceed any of these limits, and the effects of ritual spells cannot be produced at all with spontaneous magic.

To attempt to cast a ritual spell, you must spend 15 minutes in uninterrupted concentration for every 5 levels of the ritual spell. You must also spend 1 pawn of raw vis (see "Using Raw Vis" on [page 77](../page-refs/page-77.md)) for every 5 levels of the spell or fraction thereof. That vis must match either the Technique or Form used in the spell.

To determine your success, make a casting roll as you do for formulaic spells, adding your Concentration if you have that Ability. Because ritual spells are both physically and mentally demanding, fatigue loss is greater for ritual spells than formulaic or spontaneous spells. If your spellcasting roll is greater than the level of the spell, it works and you lose a Fatigue level. If your spellcasting roll is between the spell's level minus 10 and the spell's level the spells succeeds and you lose two Fatigue levels. If you miss the spell's level by more than 10 the spell fails, you lose two Fatigue levels, and all the vis used is wasted. If you drop below "Unconscious" due to fatigue loss, you are unconscious for an extra hour. If your ritual spell succeeds, remember your roll, as it may be required to determine whether the spell penetrates an opponent's Magic Resistance (see **Magic Resistance** on [page 72](../page-refs/page-72.md)).

Many ritual spells have two ranges or durations listed. For each level of either range or duration that you wish to extend, you must spend an additional 15 minutes and one additional pawn of vis per 5 levels of the spell. Thus, if you wish to extend both the range and duration to the second (longer) shown, you have to spend 45 minutes and three pawns of vis per 5 levels of the ritual spell.

### Requisites

Most spells involve a simple combination of two Arts, one Form and one Technique. Some spells, however, involve more than two. For instance, a spell that turns a human into a bird uses Muto because you are transforming something, Corpus because you are affecting a human body, and Animál because you are turning the human body into an animal body. In addition to involving the two primary Arts—Corpus and Muto in this case—casting the spell concerns your Animál score as well. This third Art is a requisite.

Requisites, if any, are listed for each formulaic spell in the Spells chapter. (See the spell *Curse of Circe* on [page 125](../page-refs/page-125.md) as an example.) Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have wider knowledge. You must use the lesser of your score in the requisite and your score in the spell's main Technique or Form—Technique if the requisite is a Technique, Form if the requisite is a Form. For example, if you have the scores Animál 6 and Corpus 13, and you cast the Muto Corpus spell *Curse of Circe*, which has a requisite of Animál, you treat your Corpus score as if it were only 6. Note that if your requisite happened to be higher (for example, if your Animál were 15), you would use the lower basic form (your Corpus of 13 in this case).

Sometimes a spell has a requisite for both its Technique and Form. You must use the lowest in each case. And, if several requisites apply to the same primary Art (for example, if there are two Form requisites), your effective score is the lowest of the group. Furthermore, any Magical Affinities or Deficiencies you have with an Art apply when you use that Art as a requisite.

Requisites listed with a spell's statistics apply when you are learning, inventing, or casting that spell, but do not apply for determining the defender's magic resistance. The defender's magic resistance is determined by the spell's primary Form, not that listed as a requisite, even if the caster's requisite Form score is higher than that of his primary Form score.

### Casting Requisites

Some requisites are not listed along with a spell's statistics because they only apply when the spell is being used in a certain way, not when learning or inventing it. These are called casting requisites. You choose which Arts you use as casting requisites when casting the spell, so what you can affect is limited by your choice. The lowest Technique score and Form score among the primary Arts and all the chosen casting requisites are the ones you use when you cast the spell.

### Spontaneous Requisites

Requisites work the same way for spontaneous spells. When the Arts to be used are determined, determine whether requisites are involved. If so, they limit your Arts just as they do for formulaic spells.

### Targeting

Some spells affect a target directly. While casting *Curse of Circe*, for example, you must concentrate on the body that you are transforming into a pig. If you successfully cast the spell, it affects the target directly (though it may resist magically).

Other spells conjure some type of medium, such as fire, which in turn affects the target. To have their desired effect, these spells usually need to hit the mark. For instance, if you are trying to blind an enemy with *Flash of the Scarlet Flames* ([page 135](../page-refs/page-135.md)) you have to get the flash right in the target's face. These spells require a targeting roll in order for you to place them correctly. Spells that need to be targeted are indicated with the word “Aimed,” followed by the targeting modifier for that spell.

The die rolled for targeting depends on the situation. If something bad could result from failing to cast the spell or if the situation is otherwise stressful, roll a stress die. If there's no pressure, roll a simple die. Add the roll, your Perception, and your Finesse together. If this meets or exceeds an ease factor set by the storyguide (using the table on [page 71](../page-refs/page-71.md)), your targeting is successful and the spell takes its full effect. If you miss your intended target, your spell takes effect behind or to the side of the target, failing to affect it. Of course, the spell still goes off, so it may affect others and have various side effects. The storyguide should determine exactly what happens when a targeting roll fails. The results of a botched targeting roll can be horrible—rather than affect the intended target, you might hit a friend, yourself, or something you're trying to protect. Again, the storyguide has full control over the effects.

#### Spell Targeting Table

The basic ease factor for spell targeting is a 3+. Modifiers to this ease factor are listed below. For example, a hustling target at far range requires a 9+ to hit.

| Description of Target | Ease Factor Modifier |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Standing still or moving carefully | 0 |
| Hustling | +3 |
| Sprinting | +6 |
| In plain view | 0 |
| Obscured (darkness or cover) | +3 |
| Near range | 0 |
| Far range | +3 |
| Sight range | +6 |
| Large target | – (target's Size) |
| Small target | + (absolute value of target's Size) |

### Arcane Connections

Some spells, in accordance with the Law of Arcane Connections, require an arcane connection to cast. An arcane connection is some item that is intimate to the target of the spell. It might be an actual piece of the target, such as a stone from a cobbled street, clippings from a horse's mane, or the hair of a person. Or, it might be some important supernatural piece of equipment, such as a magus' talisman.

Exactly what is and what is not an arcane connection is up to storyguide interpretation in some cases. For example, a magus may be able to establish an arcane connection to a little girl through her doll, if she is exceptionally emotionally tied to it.

Note that there is spell range called “arcane connection.” An arcane connection (that is, a physical item) is always required to cast spells of this range. Sometimes spells of other ranges will also require an arcane connection. Even then, those spells retain their original range.

## Resisting Hostile Magic

There are two kinds of protection from magic: natural resistance and magic resistance. Natural resistance is a defense inherent to the target of a spell. It derives from the target's essence, functions automatically and constantly, and is completely nonmagical. Most people and creatures have only natural resistance, and since most spells are unaffected by natural resistance, normal people fall easily to them. If a spell can be defended against with natural resistance, that spell's description outlines how the natural resistance works. For instance, *Trust of Childlike Faith* ([page 147](../page-refs/page-147.md)) can be resisted by an Intelligence roll. Natural resistance rolls are always made on a stress die. In general, a successful natural resistance roll prevents a spell from having any effect on you.

Magic resistance can come from a variety of sources—from innate magical nature, from holy (or unholy) blessings, from the Hermetic Parma Magica (see **Parma Magica** on [page 73](../page-refs/page-73.md)) or from knowledge of a Hermetic Form. Magic resistance can be cumulative with natural resistance, and can often stop a spell or effect before it even hits its target.

If your natural and magical resistance fails, you may still be able to protect yourself with a quick counterspell. See **Fast-Cast Spells** on [page 75](../page-refs/page-75.md) for more information on this option.

### Spells That Can Be Magically Resisted

Whether you can use magic resistance against a given spell depends on how it affects you. All spells that attack you directly, or attack you by magically forming a medium (like a lightning bolt), can be resisted. The incidental effects of spells that affect you by changing your environment cannot be resisted. Most illusions cannot be magically resisted, because they exist in your environment and don't affect you directly.

Intéllego spells can be resisted but not always countered. If an Intéllego spell gives the caster a vision of the target without probing the target's person in some way, the target's successful resistance lets him know that he is the subject of some type of detection magic. He does not know what specific spell was cast or who cast it. Spells like *Eye of the Sage* ([page 124](../page-refs/page-124.md)) work like this. On the other hand, Intéllego spells that probe the target's person or anything else protected by the target's magic resistance, such as spells that read minds or attempt to determine if the target's possessions are magical, are blocked when resisted.

### Magic Resistance

When a spell that can be resisted strikes a character with magic resistance, the target must roll a stress die to see if the spell is resisted. There are a number of modifiers to this roll.

- **Might:** This is a statistic that describes creatures and other non-human powers. For instance, a faerie with a Faerie Might of 22 has a 22 Magic Resistance.

- **Parma Magica:** This is a ritual that Hermetic magi use to protect themselves. It is usually a magus's Parma Magica Ability score multiplied by five.

- **Form Knowledge:** Magi who have a score in the Form that is affecting them add their Form score to their total. If you are a master of the Art of Ignem, you are not easily affected by flame spells.

A target's magic resistance covers only the target and anything he wears or holds in his hands. Just touching something does not convey protection on it, and things extended far from the body (such as a fully extended staff) are not covered by magic resistance. The storyguide has the final judgment on what is protected by magic resistance.

Magic resistance is automatic for all creatures that naturally have it, including magi. It is possible, however, to decide not to resist a given spell. By concentrating, you may suppress the bonus provided by your score in an appropriate Form and also drop your Parma Magica. If a Parma Magica is temporarily dropped, it resumes protection when you will it to, and remains until it wears out at the next sunrise or sunset, as usual (see **Parma Magica**, below). You do not need to lower your Parma Magica to affect yourself with most spells. Any spell you cast of range Personal automatically circumvents your magic resistance.

#### Parma Magica

The use of the Parma Magica is unique to magi of the Order of Hermes, but is not a genuine spell. Rather, it is a ritual that focuses magical energies into a shield around you and others you designate it to protect. It takes about a minute to perform this ritual, and all those who are to be protected must be present.

Once conjured, the Parma Magica adds 5 times your score in the Ability to your magic resistance rolls. The ritual protects you until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. At that time you may perform the ritual again, renewing your protection.

You may protect one other person for each point you have in the Ability, but your score is effectively 3 points lower when you are protecting them. Therefore, in practice, you need a score of four or greater to protect others. For example, if you have Parma Magica at 5 and you are protecting other people (up to five of them), you all receive a 10 point bonus to your Magic Resistance from the Parma Magica. (Your skill of five, minus three because others are being protected, equals 2, which is then multiplied by five.)

Your score in the Form of any attacking spell also applies to the magic resistance of all those under the protection of your Parma Magica. It applies fully and with no penalty. Each individual protected by your Parma Magica who is in the range of effect of a spell must roll his own magic resistance.

Others protected by your Parma Magica must be within 15 paces of you to gain the bonus to their Magic Resistance. They may move in and out of this 15 pace radius without breaking the spell, as its duration is until the next sunrise or sunset, they just won't benefit if they are more than 15 paces away from you. Remember that those protected by your Parma Magica are only those you designated while performing the ritual. You must perform a whole new ritual if you want to afford magic resistance to anyone not involved in the last one.

#### Awareness of Attack

Whenever your magic resistance succeeds in protecting you from intruding magics, your Parma gives you an immediate sense that magics have been repelled. You do not know what type of magic is repulsed, nor its source. If your magic resistance fails to repel the attack, your Parma gives you no indication that a spell has been cast against you, so certain spells may affect you without your knowledge. However, a spell that, say, causes you to burst into flames will likely draw your attention.

### Concentration

It takes concentration to cast a spell. If anything distracts you while you are casting, you must make a Concentration roll to maintain the spell. If you ever fail a Concentration roll while casting or maintaining a spell, the

| Distraction Table |
|-------------------|
| **Situation** | **Ease Factor** |
| Walking | 6+ |
| Running | 12+ |
| Dodging | 15+ |
| Jostled | 9+ |
| Sudden noise or flash of light | 9+ |
| Knocked Down | 12+ |
| Damaged | 15+ |

<!-- End of page-69-73.md -->


<!-- Start of page-74-78.md -->

## Botch Suggestions

Attract unwanted attention: The attention of someone or something, perhaps the target of your spell, is drawn to you.

Caster addled: You are rendered insane, confused, or demented. You acquire the Flaw Simple-Minded for an indefinite duration.

Caster overwhelmed: You are overwhelmed by your own magic. Make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or be knocked unconscious.

Connection with target: Your target becomes aware of your investigations, and may learn something about you through the arcane link that is temporarily established.

Debilitating: The spell pushes the target too hard and does permanent damage: for example, a Rego Animál spell might forever leave a beast without its natural instincts and urges.

Flawed creation: A creation is heavily flawed, though the flaw may not be obvious until the creation is expected to serve the function it was created for.

Incomplete or improper effect: For example, a spell intended to transform you into a wolf might only transform your head and hands.

Out of control: The spell creates or calls forth something beyond the caster's ability to control.

Related but unwanted effect: For example, a spell intended to transform you into a wolf might turn you into another animal.

Reverse effect: The spell does exactly the opposite of what is intended.

Roll for Twilight: Roll to avoid Wizard's Twilight. If you avoid it, you still suffer another botch result.

Spell affects caster: You, instead of the intended target, are affected.

Too powerful: The spell does more than it should and thereby causes problems.

Undying spell: You cannot stop the spell by concentrating; it does not end at the normal time, and it proves resistant to being dispelled.

Wrong target: Pick a new one at random.

The ease factor when making a Concentration roll is dependent upon the type of distraction. The type of die rolled is always a stress die, and it is modified by the caster's Concentration and Intelligence. Sample ease factors are listed on the Distraction Table. When more than one situation applies, use the largest ease factor.

## Dangers

Despite the Order's attempts to regulate it and make it a science, magic remains an art. No matter how skilled a practitioner you are, and no matter what precautions you take (short of not using magic at all), your magic will sometimes get out of your control. From the danger of casting a spell improperly to the danger of the enigmatic Wizard's Twilight, magic is filled with hazards.

### Botches

The most common danger you face when performing magic is a botch. The results of a given spell cast under stress are not entirely predictable, and a botch on a spell roll means that you've made a mistake that, rather than just causing your spell to fail, causes your spell to produce different effects than you intended. Though the effects of botches can vary widely, they are almost universally detrimental. The storyguide should use his imagination when determining botches. A table of suggestions is provided. In general, single botches are embarrassing or inconvenient, double botches are dangerous, and triple botches are potentially deadly. Effects may be tailored to the Technique and Form that were being used, or may be more unpredictable.

### Wizard's Twilight

When your magic gets beyond your control, or you are overwhelmed by the powerful magic of another, you can succumb to what is known as Wizard's Twilight. Wizard's Twilight is a state where magic alters your very being, perhaps improving your knowledge of the arcane, perhaps deforming you physically. With each bout of Twilight, you approach Final Twilight, when you succumb to magic for the final time and pass completely out of the physical world. Wizard's Twilight is discussed fully in the Storyguide chapter, on [page 182](../page-refs/page-182.md).

## Spellcasting Options

### Mastering a Spell

When you gain experience points, you can use them to master spells. Usually, you may assign no more than one point to a given spell per story, though more than one point might be assigned with the storyguide's permission if the experience was awarded for an entire season or more at once. When you accumulate a spell's magnitude in experience points, you have mastered it.

When casting a mastered spell, you always roll a simple die, unless you are using vis to boost the spell (see "Using Raw Vis" on [page 77](../page-refs/page-77.md)). If you are using vis to boost the spell, roll one less botch die. In addition, you gain a bonus of +1 to all Concentration rolls involving the Mastered spell, and may attempt to multiple cast it (see below).

### Multiple Casting

You can cast several copies of a single mastered spell so that it affects more people, objects, or areas (as applicable) than normal. A single target may also be affected more than once. Only mastered spells may be multiple cast.

When multiple casting, you must first roll a stress die + Finesse + Intelligence – the number of spells to be cast. If this result is greater than 9, you proceed to cast the spells. If it fails, your action is wasted.

Each spell must be rolled for separately (as normal, save that each roll is reduced by the total number of spells being cast). If any of the spells fail outright, you lose the fatigue and the spell fails, though others may still take effect successfully. If you lose consciousness, any spells that were successful still run their course. If you lose consciousness and accumulate additional fatigue loss, each additional fatigue level causes an extra hour of unconsciousness.

Subtract the total number of discrete targets from any targeting rolls that are required. Even if all spells are directed at the same target, a -1 applies. The storyguide can further penalize or prohibit multiple casting that is especially difficult, such as casting two spells in opposite directions.

For example, say a given magus multiple casts three Balls of Abysmal Flame ([page 136](../page-refs/page-136.md)), two at a single target and one at another. The Finesse + Intelligence roll is made at a -3 (for the number of spells), the spell rolls are made at a -3 (for the number of spells) and the targeting rolls are made at a -2 (for the number of separate targets).

### Fast-Cast Spells

To cast a spell safely you need time to draw together and control the energy that powers it. Formulaic spells always require a given amount of time to cast. Even spontaneous spells require a small measure of time. If you're daring or desperate, though, you can cast a spontaneous spell even more quickly than normal; this is called fast-casting. Fast-casting a spell entails gathering the energy and expending it before the normal precautions are taken to control it. You may have to take this risk to defend yourself against an incoming attack or spell, or to react to a sudden mishap or accident. Fast-cast spells are also used to defend against attacks that magic resistance and natural resistance cannot defend against. For example, if an enemy magus causes a tree branch to swing down and strike you, you can fast-cast a spontaneous spell in response to make the branch swing wide.

There are three steps to determine the success of a fast-cast spell: compare speed, roll for casting, and determine spell potency.

As the situation demands, compare your stress die + Quickness + Finesse + Encumbrance to the stress die + Quickness + Finesse + Encumbrance of another spell caster, to the Initiative Totals of those attacking you physically, or to an ease factor set by the storyguide. If your opponent's total is higher than yours, their spell or attack beats your fast-cast spell. In this case, you must roll to maintain concentration before you can cast a spell (presuming you still wish to cast it at that point). This is a normal concentration roll, based on any interruptions you've suffered.

Next, roll for your spontaneous spell and subtract 5 before dividing the roll. That is, roll Technique + Form + Intelligence - 5, divided by 2 if a Fatigue level is spent or divided by 5 if not. If you roll a 0 when fast-casting, you must roll three extra botch dice.

Fast-cast defenses have very limited range, duration, and potential for seriously affecting targets, as their levels tend to be low. The duration of most fast-cast counterspells is Momentary.

You completely ward off a spell attack if your total equals or exceeds half the penetration of the attacking spell. Otherwise it penetrates anyway. When defending from mundane attacks, a spell total of 10 protects you from a single attack, 15 from up to three known attacks, 20 from any number of known attacks, and 25 against all attacks, known or unknown. These results assume that your spell is appropriate to defending against attacks: a Perdo Ignem spell, for instance, may stop flaming oil from harming you, but will be ineffectual against axe strokes.

### Recognizing Spells

The Form required for fast-cast defense against a certain mundane attack is easy to determine (for example, ReTe would be a good choice for redirecting sword swings), but for fast-cast defenses against magic, you must at least be able to determine the Form of the magic you are defending against, or you will be unable to construct an appropriate defense.

If the attacker is a Hermetic magus and is using words you can hear or gestures that you can see, then you can determine both the Technique and the Form of the attacking spell automatically. However, Awareness rolls may be required for you to perceive the words or gestures used if the magus is using soft speech or subtle gestures (see "Words and Gestures," below), or if there are distractions, such as the loud noises of nearby battle.

In all cases where the Form and Technique are not obvious, you must make an Awareness roll of 9+ to recognize the Form and Technique of the attacking magic. If the attacking spell is Hermetic, you may add your Magic Theory to this roll. If you fail to determine the Form of the attacking magic, and still want to chance a fast-cast defense, you must guess at the Form and hope you're right.

#### Words and Gestures Table

| Voice | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| Booming | +1 |
| Firm | 0 |
| Soft | -5 |
| None | -10 |
| Gesture | Modifier |
| Vigorous | +1 |
| Bold | 0 |
| Subtle | -2 |
| None | -5 |

It is also possible to exaggerate your motions and yell at the top of your lungs in casting a spell to make the elements of magic respond more obediently to your commands. Use the Words and Gestures Table to determine your penalty when casting subtly or with excessive vigor. The modifiers listed are cumulative. For example, if you are using soft words and subtle gestures, your penalty is -7. If you are making subtle gestures but screaming at the top of your lungs, your penalty is -1.

If you cast a spell without any gestures, you do not suffer penalties to your spell rolls for being encumbered.

### Words and Gestures

Normally all spellcasting requires the use of a firm tone of voice and bold hand gestures. It is possible to cast either a formulaic or spontaneous spell without the firm voice and strong gestures that are typical, but doing so makes the spell more difficult to cast.

### Extra Care

You may wish to spend extra time preparing to cast a spontaneous spell or a non-ritual formulaic spell in order to be more careful and to increase your chances of casting the spell correctly. Ritual spells may not be aided in this manner, since the extra time for preparation is already accounted for in the time to cast the spell.

You spend one minute per 5 levels of the spell in preparation, considering the symbols you are about to use, thinking about the laws of magic, and carefully gathering the energy that powers the spell. (When taking extra care with a spontaneous spell, spend one minute per 5 levels of the spell you hope to cast. You cannot then cast a spell higher than this level.) When the preparation time is over, you cast the spell, adding your Concentration score to your spell roll. In addition, if you are making a stress roll, you may reduce the number of botch dice, if any, by one (but never below one).

### Spell Foci

Most formulaic spells have certain special ingredients, known as spell foci, that aid in their casting and that supply some of the magical energy needed to cast them. When you use the focus specified in the description of a spell, you gain the specified bonus to your roll when casting the spell. Failing to use these foci incurs no ill effects or penalties, unless the spell description notes them as a requirement, as in the case of certain powerful spells. Failing to use a specified mandatory focus results in failure of the spell.

Note that a focus created through magic (probably by a Creo spell) offers no spellcasting bonus unless it is made permanent through the use of raw vis. Otherwise, a focus must only exist naturally to be functional; it does not have to possess magical properties.

Unless a spell's description states otherwise, spell foci continue to exist after the casting of a spell and can be used over and over.

### Using Raw Vis

As explained in the "Raw Vis" section ([page 67](../page-refs/page-67.md)), raw vis is magical power in physical form. It is required to cast ritual spells, and you can use it to strengthen spells. With spontaneous spells, your only use for raw vis is to increase your spell roll (and thus increase the level of the resulting spell). With formulaic and ritual spells, you may use raw vis to extend range, extend duration, or increase your spell roll. You must always use vis that is of the same Form or Technique as the spell you are casting with it, and you must be physically touching the substance within which raw vis is contained in order to use it.

When you choose to use raw vis, you must determine the number of pawns that are to be invested in the magical activity before you initiate it. Once you have established the number, you cannot change it, and if the spell is disrupted, fails, or botches, all the vis you dedicated to it is lost. When using vis to increase your spell roll, add +5 to the roll for every pawn of vis expended. When casting spontaneous spells, you add this bonus before the roll is divided. If you want to increase the range or duration of a formulaic or ritual spell (to the amount listed after the slash in the description), you expend one pawn of raw vis per 5 levels of the spell or fraction thereof. If you wish to extend both range and duration, you must expend vis for both. Note that using raw vis to strengthen a spell is tricky, and you must always roll a stress die when strengthening a spell with vis, even if you have mastered the spell in question. In addition, if you roll a zero, you must roll one extra botch die per pawn of vis expended.

There are limits to the amount of vis you can utilize at one time. Your highest applicable Art score is the maximum number of pawns of vis you may invest into a single round of magical action or the initial casting of a given spell. Furthermore, you cannot spend more pawns of a given type of vis than you have score in that art. For example, if a magus with Perdo 10 and Mentem 6 cast a Perdo Mentem spell, he could use up to 10 pawns of Perdo vis, or up to 6 pawns of Mentem vis. He could also choose to use Perdo vis and Mentem vis in combination, as long as the total number of pawns does not exceed 10 and the number of pawns of Mentem vis does not exceed 6.

For laboratory activities, Vim + Magic Theory is the limit to the number of pawns of vis (regardless of type) that you may use in one season. Vim is used because it's representative of magic as a whole, so it imposes a limit on the amount of magic you can work with over an extended period.

If you try to use more vis than your appropriate Art or Vim score allows, whether you are casting a spell or working in the lab, the extra points are used up, but you do not gain any benefit from them. They do not count towards the action attempted, but you still have to roll one extra botch die per pawn of vis expended.

At the storyguide's option, the uncontrolled magical power that you release may affect your surroundings, causing magical side effects in proportion to the amount of uncontrolled vis expended.

### Casting a Spell While Maintaining Another

Certain spells require that you maintain concentration on them to sustain their effect. It is possible to cast another spell while maintaining this concentration, but it is difficult and risks causing the spell already in effect to fail.

When casting the second spell, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 15+. You gain a +3 bonus if the second spell is the same spell as the first or if the second target is the same as the target of the first. If you fail, the second spell is not cast and your action is wasted. If you botch, you lose the first spell as well. If you succeed, roll the second spell as normal.

### Casting from a Text

It is possible to cast a formulaic spell that you do not know yourself if you have a readable copy of it. Indeed, many powerful spells have never been learned by anyone but their inventors; they are cast almost exclusively from texts. To cast a spell from a text, you spend one round for every 5 levels of the spell, make a spellcasting roll on a stress die, and apply double the normal number of botch dice.

If your spellcasting roll does not equal or exceed the spell level, you lose one Fatigue level for every 5 points, or fraction thereof, by which you missed the spell level. If you go unconscious from Fatigue loss, the spell fails. Otherwise, the spell succeeds, whether you make the spellcasting roll or not. If you go unconscious and the spell fails, you must roll to see if you botch, even if the spellcasting roll was not a zero.

Ritual spells may be cast from a text, but they take much longer. You must spend 30 minutes for every 5 levels of the spell, and must expend raw vis, just as you do for casting the ritual from memory.

### Counteracting Spells

Sometimes you may want to nullify the effects of another magus's spell. There is no hard and fast means of doing so. Fast-cast spells ([page 75](../page-refs/page-75.md)) are one means, but as those spells are unrefined, their ability to dispel other magics is limited. Another, more common, means of nullifying another magus's spells is with a prepared spell of your own. There are numerous spells described in the Spells chapter that are designed to dispel other magics. Most of these spells are tailored to affect spells of their own Form and Technique. Most also involve rituals, so vis is a necessity. Some Vim spells, like Wind of Mundane Silence, are capable of counteracting any kind of spell or magic. In addition, spells like Aegis of the Hearth provide protection from magic in the first place.

### Certamen

Certámen (Care-TAH-men, Latin for "duel") is the ceremony by which two magi conduct a magical duel. It serves as a nonlethal way for one magus to establish dominance and precedence over another, and has formal restrictions to keep it from disrupting the unity of the Order. One need not accept a challenge to certámen, but the social cost may be no less than that of accepting and losing. You may challenge anyone to certámen once, but the Code prohibits you from challenging the same person again unless he challenges you in the meantime. Thus, you cannot hound an unwilling opponent into certámen. Certámen is solely an institution of the Order of Hermes; non-Hermetic wizards do not have the ability to participate in the ceremony.

To engage in certámen, you and the other magus must agree on one Form and Technique combination you will both use. If you do not agree on the Form and Technique, the duel cannot take place. By tradition, the aggressor in the duel chooses the Technique and the defender chooses the Form, but this system is purely artificial. The rules of certámen permit the use of any system for determining the Arts used as long as it is acceptable to both magi.

Once the Technique and Form are chosen, you and your opponent concentrate for a moment, both entering trances. While entranced, competing magi have no defense against physical attacks. Each becomes attuned to the magical forces surrounding them, shaping them into phantasms representing the Technique and Form of the duel. If the Technique and Form are Muto and Animál, the phantasms might be two animals, one controlled by each magi. During the course of the duel, each animal changes into various other animals in an effort to defeat the other. A Creo Ignem contest could consist of two fiery beings fighting. In an Intéllego Aquam contest it might appear that the combatants are in hazy water, each trying to reach some goal. The illusionary battle is a representation of the more subtle magical battle which affects the minds of the combatants.

To attempt to emerge the victor, each combatant rolls a stress die + Technique + Form + Intelligence + Certámen each round. The magus with the highest result determines the amount by which he beat the other combatant. These points can be used to weaken the other combatant immediately, or they can be saved and added to the next round's roll.

If used to weaken the opponent, roll a stress die + Intelligence + Certámen + the difference between your score and your opponent's score. Compare this to your opponent's

### Winning Certámen

There are three ways to win certámen. The first involves wearing your opponent down until he falls unconscious. When this happens, the victor is entitled to cast a single spell at the loser. This spell, which must be of the same Technique and Form of the contest, circumvents the loser's Parma Magica (though the loser still gets a magic resistance roll based on the Form of the spell). In most certámen contests, this "free" spell is unnecessary, because your opponent's collapse already designates your victory. However, some duelists use it anyway to intimidate and embarrass those who fight them. This free spell can be used to harm your fallen opponent, but remember, certámen is intended to be a harmless way to resolve disputes.

The second way to win certámen is by surrender. If your opponent realizes he is outmatched, or wants to walk away from the duel, he can concede the contest. Such a submission means that loser is still capable of defending himself, so he has full Parma Magica and Magic Resistance against any final spell cast at him.

The third way to win certámen is to maintain concentration in the face of distraction when your opponent does not. Concentration rolls are not necessitated by the loss of Fatigue levels during certámen. Sometimes, however, conditions surrounding the duel necessitate that the duelists make Concentration rolls. If one of the duelists fails a Concentration roll, the fight ends. The duelist's loss of concentration causes his phantasm to disappear, indicating the opponent's victory. A victor through loss of concentration does not get a free spell.

Loss of concentration, however, does not necessarily mean that certámen is over and that a victor is decided. If the victor under these circumstances refuses the honor, and the combatant who lost concentration agrees, the battle may resume until a clear victor emerges. A magus might refuse a victory by loss of concentration for reasons of honor, or because he intends to do more harm.

### Using Raw Vis in Certámen

You can use raw vis at any time during certámen, even if your opponent doesn't use it or doesn't expect its use. For every pawn you expend, add 5 to a single contest roll. This bonus applies to your rolls that involve Form and Technique, not to rolls that determine Fatigue levels lost by your opponent. Raw vis used must be attuned to one of the Arts used in the duel, either Form or Technique. The number of pawns you can use in one round is limited to your score in the Form or Technique the vis is attuned to or your certámen score, whichever is lower.

### Certámen in Combat

If the duel is integrated into a melee situation, rolls for certámen are made in the magic phase of the round. Magi involved in certámen can do nothing else until the duel is resolved.
