# Other Perils

The world of Ars Magica is fraught with danger. There are plenty of ways to get hurt besides combat, and some of the most common are described below. Sometimes, especially in the descriptions of spells, an amount of damage will be given in the form, +x damage. When this occurs, you are to roll a simple die and add the amount, subtracting the target's Soak to determine damage.

## Illness and Disease

Illness weakens people; you can simulate this by requiring Stamina rolls which, if failed, remove Fatigue levels. The precise effects of a disease are up to the storyguide. The character regains energy and Fatigue levels after shaking the illness. This might require more Stamina rolls or another character's use of Medicine.

Illnesses can also temporarily or permanently reduce Characteristics. It can also produce temporary afflictions like those acquired from aging (see "Aging," below).

## Fire

A fire's heat is rated with a modifier to the damage it deals. When a character is damaged by fire, roll a simple die, add the modifier, and compare this total to the character's Soak. A torch might carry a +6 modifier, while a raging house fire could cause +15. The first round a character is exposed to fire, a character's Soak score applies. In subsequent rounds armor no longer affords protection. In fact, a character in metal armor will take damage for another round after leaving or extinguishing the fire, from hot armor. Other bad things can happen in a fire, such as disfiguring burns and the loss of valuable, flammable items, at the storyguide's option.

## Falling

A falling character suffers a quality die of damage, which is compared to his Soak. For every two feet a character falls, add +1 to the damage roll. However, armor is less effective, since the damage is dealt by impact over the whole body. Halve the Protection value of the armor when figuring Soak.

Hard surfaces, such as rock, double the falling roll. Soft surfaces cushion the blow somewhat, halving it. Individuals falling into water take only one quarter damage.

If there is something to grab at, a character can try to break his fall to reduce the damage. This requires an Athletics roll of 6+. Success means the first five feet of the fall do not count toward the damage roll.

## Poison

There are a great many different poisons, each with a different effect. A poison is described by its strength, the amount of time it takes to work, and the possible effects. Typically, the victim must make a Stamina roll against an ease factor representing the strength of the poison. Effects depend on the degree by which a character fails the roll (though most poisons have a weaker effect that occurs even if the character succeeds) and on whether there was a botch.

## Deprivation

Denial of the necessities of life, such as air, water, warmth, and food, can cause weakness and death. Deprivation is usually simulated by Stamina rolls, whose failure costs the character a Fatigue level. When the character runs out of Fatigue levels (and is Unconscious), failed Stamina rolls cost Body levels. Sooner of later, depending on the type of deprivation, the character will die unless assisted. Not even the toughest can go without basic necessities for long.

Determine the ease factor and the frequency of Stamina rolls based on the nature of the deprivation. A character deprived of both water and shelter should make rolls more often than if simply deprived of water. Recovery also depends on the nature of the deprivation.
