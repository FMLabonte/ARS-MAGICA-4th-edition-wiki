# Health, Aging, Twilight

During the course of a saga, many things will affect the characters' well-being. They will exert themselves in battle and in spellcasting; they will be harmed by weapons and by illness; they will age, wither, and ultimately pass away into death or something else. These are realities of life in Mythic Europe—rules for dealing with them follow.

## Fatigue

Characters who exert themselves in combat and other strenuous activities can become tired and even exhausted. This is measured using Fatigue levels. Most characters have six Fatigue levels, and each is given a name. Listed in order from least fatigued to most fatigued, they are Fresh, Winded, Weary, Tired, Dazed, and Unconscious. Characters are normally Fresh until they perform some strenuous action, such as engaging in combat, casting spontaneous spells, or running a great distance. Strenuous actions require a Fatigue test: roll Stamina + Encumbrance on a stress die against an ease factor of 6. Failure means the loss of one Fatigue Level. A botch costs two. Combat has a different set of rules for fatigue loss that replace those given here. [See page 168](../page-refs/page-168.md).

Each Fatigue level above Winded has a penalty associated with it (except for Unconscious, which is its own penalty). Fatigued characters must apply the relevant penalty to all rolls, including further fatigue tests, but not Soak attempts. These penalties represent the effects of growing exhaustion, and are cumulative with those resulting from lost Body levels (see "Wounds," below) The penalty for Weary is -1, for Tired -3, and for Dazed -5.

### Recovery From Fatigue

A character recovers from fatigue one level at a time, starting with the most exhausted level. The table below is a guideline to help you determine how long it will take a character to recover. Recovery from fatigue requires quiet rest; if the character remains active, recovery time is doubled. At the storyguide's option, fatigued characters may make a Stamina roll against an ease factor of 9 when they are recovering. Success allows recovery in half the normal time.

These recovery times only apply to activities that have not been performed over a long period. For any Fatigue levels lost through long-term exertion (like running a long distance, carrying a heavy load all day, or engaging in heavy labor all afternoon), the character can recover only with a good meal and a good night's sleep. It is up to the storyguide to determine the nature of the exertion and whether the character can recover as per the Fatigue Recovery Table or through food and sleep. Stamina rolls to recover from fatigue which resulted from long term exertion or extremely exhausting activity should not be allowed.

A rule of thumb is to consider the most strenuous activity that caused Fatigue loss. Thus, if a character ran a short distance, then engaged in combat, then hiked all day, losing three Fatigue levels, recovery should take considerably longer than it would for any of these singly because of the long-term hiking.

|  **Fatigue Recovery Chart**  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Fatigue Level | Time to recover to next lower level  |
|  Winded | 2 minutes  |
|  Weary | 10 minutes  |
|  Tired | 30 minutes  |
|  Dazed | 60 minutes  |
|  Unconscious | 2 hours  |

## Wounds

Physical damage is recorded in Body levels similarly to the way fatigue is recorded in Fatigue levels. Most humans have six Body levels: Unhurt, Hurt, Light Wounds, Medium Wounds, Heavy Wounds, and Incapacitated.

Whenever a character takes damage from any source, the character uses his Soak score to resist that damage. If the character's Soak equals or exceeds the damage being applied, no significant wounds result. The character may still be bruised, scraped, or singed, depending on the type of attack, but the damage is not enough to take a lasting toll. For every full five points by which the damage exceeds the Soak score, one Body level of wounds is sustained. See the Combat chapter for more details.

As a character takes damage and loses Body levels, he is impaired and eventually killed. Anyone who is Incapacitated and sustains further injuries is killed or wounded so badly that death is imminent and inevitable. Otherwise, characters can recover with proper medical attention and rest.

The Unhurt and Hurt levels carry no penalties, while Incapacitated means no actions are possible. Each other Body level has some penalty that is applied to rolls requiring physical or mental exertion. Individuals with Light Wounds suffer -1, Medium Wounds -3, and Heavy Wounds -5.

Wound penalties affect almost all rolls, and are cumulative with those from lost Fatigue levels (see “Fatigue” above)

### Recovering From Wounds

There are several means for recovering from injuries. Rest and natural healing are effective if the wounds are slight. A Hurt character automatically recovers to Unhurt in one day. More grievous injuries require more specialized attention, as they do not heal on their own in the field. Strenuous activity might even aggravate their severity, especially if they have not been stabilized.

Serious wounds require lengthy rest and care. The Wound Recovery Chart indicates the progress of a character's healing. Roll Stamina + Chirurgy on a stress die, and

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Die Roll + Sta + Chirurgy  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Wounds | 0 | 1-2 | 3-5 | 6-8 | 9-11 | 12-14 | 15-17 | 18+  |
|  Light | X | 14 | 10 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3  |

Numbers indicate the number of days required to heal to the next lower level. If the result is an X, consult the Catastrophe Subchart.

#### Catastrophe Subchart

Roll Stress die + Sta + Chirurgy and consult the following chart.

**Roll Result**

0 ...Death
1 ...Coma. Further rolls to determine recovery are at -2, and the time rolled is doubled. You wake up when you drop to Light Wounds, at which point you must make two aging rolls.
2 ...You gain the Flaw Enfeebled.
3-4 ...You are permanently crippled. Amputation may be necessary. Represent this effect with a 3 point affliction (see “Aging” on [page 180](../page-refs/page-180.md)).
5-6 ...Your wounds fester. Lose a further Body level.
7-10 ...Make an aging roll.
11-12 ...Wounds don't heal correctly—gain 1 Decrepitude point.
13 ...Nightmares and flashbacks torment you for some time to come. For the next (simple die – Brave Personality Trait) seasons, you must make a Stamina roll of 6+ to willingly place yourself in a situation where you might be injured.
14+ ...Slow recovery. Recovery times on the Wound Recovery Chart are doubled.

### Recovery from Incapacitation

For an Incapacitated character, the outlook is grim—death could come at any time. The player must make two Stamina stress rolls each day (at sunrise and sunset) that the character remains at this level. On a roll of 0 or less, the character dies. A roll of $9+$ improves the Body level to Heavy Wounds, and recovery proceeds normally. Any other roll means a somewhat worsened condition, and all subsequent recovery rolls are made at a cumulative $-1$ penalty until the character either recovers a Body level or dies. If the wounds have been stabilized by Chirurgy (see below), a bonus equal to the chirurgeon's skill applies.

### Chirurgy

Chirurgy is the most common sort of aid for wounded people. With this skill, a character can tend the wounds of another (or himself, at a $-3$ penalty). Chirurgy is rough-and-ready field treatment, often rather traumatic in itself. However, if injuries are not stabilized, strenuous activity can cause the loss of further Body levels.

When a chirurgeon is tending the wounded, roll a die and add Chirurgy + Intelligence + wound penalty. (For Incapacitated characters, the penalty is -6.) If the total is $9+$, the wounded character immediately recovers one Body level. If the total is $3+$, the wounds are stabilized and the wounded person may use the tending character's Chirurgy score when rolling for recovery.

The roll for Chirurgy is usually on a simple die, assuming that medical attention is applied after a battle or accident, when drama is low. However, when tending wounds in the heat of battle, or while on the run from pursuers, the roll is made on a stress die. On a botch the patient loses an additional Body level for every 0 rolled.

Medicine may be used in the place of Chirurgy, both to tend wounds and as a modifier (again, in the place of Chirurgy) on the Wound Recovery Chart.

### Healing Spells

Certain Creo Corpus spells also aid recovery; they are described in the Spells section. However, they do not have a permanent effect unless raw vis is used. A character does not recover at all while temporarily healed through magic, but can recuperate normally after permanent healing.
