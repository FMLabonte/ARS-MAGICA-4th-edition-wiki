# Wizard's Twilight

For magi, death is not certain, so perhaps they have some right to call others "mortals" as though they themselves were not. While all others on the Earth are pursued by death, magi also face Wizard's Twilight. Many magi, especially those who attempt magic too powerful or unpredictable for them to fully control, are overcome by the vis they attempt to direct and are sent spinning away from the mortal world.

Magi usually go through a number of Twilights in their lifetime, each of which might last minutes or days. Though some magi manage to remain conscious as uncontrolled magic courses through them, and even have limited control of their bodies, most fall unconscious or enter spasms and fits, or both. Roleplaying a Twilight episode is a unique opportunity to explore the character's nature within the context of the story.

Surviving Twilight can give magi new insights into their Arts, but it can also leave physical deformities and mental aberrations. As the years pass, they become more vulnerable to final Twilight, leaving the worldly realm through a "back door." Though the body may hang on for hours or even days, the magus passes beyond the scope of human knowledge and wisdom, and is no longer human as we understand the term.

Hermetic theory generally holds that magi who have passed into final Twilight are not "dead" in the usual sense. They cannot be summoned as ghosts, and no Hermetic magic can contact them. In fact, the ghosts of dead magi can still enter Twilight through being summoned or controlled. For this reason, it is a very rare feat to summon the shade of a magus departed centuries earlier.

## Twilight Points

Magi accumulate Twilight points which, like Decrepitude, cannot be removed by any known means. Any magus who has a total of 24 Twilight points passes into final Twilight and departs from this realm, in spirit if not in form. There are various ways to gain Twilight points, but going through temporary Twilight (see below) tends to have the greatest effect.

- **Longevity potions:** Once magi begin to rely on magic to extend their lives, it begins to hold sway over them. In the first year of taking a longevity potion, a magus gains one Twilight point, with another gained every 20 years thereafter.
- **Studying Vim:** Each time a magus's score in this Art increases to a multiple of 5, one Twilight point accrues.
- **Spell botches:** The storyguide can assign Twilight points for these or other dramatic, magical effects in the course of a story. Generally, one Twilight point and an appropriate side effect are plenty.

## Temporary Twilight

When a magus with Twilight points encounters a powerful, uncontrollable magical force, he may enter temporary Twilight. As a rule of thumb, this can happen on multiple botches when casting spells or when studying raw vis in the laboratory. However, any exposure to powerful, wild magic can precipitate the episode. Follow the steps below to see whether a magus suffers Twilight.

1. **Check for Twilight:** Make a stress roll and add the character's Twilight points. Add the character's score in Enigmatic Wisdom, if he has that Ability. If the total is 24+, a temporary Twilight episode occurs; otherwise, there is no unusual effect. The character still suffers the effects of the botch, though, if that is what precipitated the roll for Twilight.

2. **Roll for Twilight points gained:** If the character enters temporary Twilight, make a simple roll. Subtract the character's Enigmatic Wisdom, and add the result to the Twilight point total. You always add at least 1. If the character's score is now 24 or more, the character enters final Twilight. Otherwise, the character has a chance to control the Twilight episode.

3. **Roll for Twilight control:** The player makes an Intelligence stress roll for the character. Add +3 for the Virtue Strong-Willed, and add the character's Enigmatic Wisdom score if he has that skill. The storyguide rolls a simple die and adds the aura rating of any supernatural realm that dominates the area to represent the intensity of the Twilight. Other bonuses can apply if the circumstances warrant a more intense Twilight (such as a quadruple spell botch).

If the player rolls higher, the character has enough control over the experience to avoid dangers and to learn something—roll for a good effect on the table above. If the storyguide's is the higher roll, the Twilight is overwhelming—roll for a bad effect.

These rolls can also be used as guidelines for deciding how long the Twilight lasts and for how much control the magus retains over his body. There is, however, no observable correlation between internal (psychic) and external (bodily) control.

### Bad Effects

**Blatant Gift:** From now on the magus's supernatural quality is stronger and always close to the surface. This is represented by the Flaw Blatant Gift ([page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md)). If the magus already has this Flaw, roll for a different bad effect. A magus with the Gentle Gift loses that Virtue, but does not gain the Flaw.

**Deficiency:** The magus suffers a minor Magic Deficiency ([see page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md)) with one Art that is opposed to his specialty. An existing minor Magic Deficiency in that Art becomes a major Magic Deficiency ([page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md)). If there is already a major Magic Deficiency in that Art, the magus gets one in another Art.

**Clumsy Magic:** The magus gains the Clumsy Magic Flaw ([page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md)). If it is already possessed, roll for a different bad effect.

**Mental defect:** The surge of magic has warped the character's mind. A Mental Flaw, such as Obsession or Fear, might be exaggerated or a quirk might worsen into a full-blown Flaw. Assign a defect related to the circumstances of the Twilight, or give the character an age-related mental affliction, as described in "Aging and Afflictions" ([page 181](../page-refs/page-181.md)).

**Physical defect:** The power of magic coursing through the character's body has permanently injured it. This might be represented by a Decrepitude point, a physical affliction (see "Aging," [page 180](../page-refs/page-180.md)), or a disfigurement, as appropriate to the situation.

**Automatic magic:** Vis oozes uncontrollably out of the magus, whose very presence causes small magical effects of some type appropriate to the character's specialty or to the Twilight itself. These effects are limited in strength and distance and can never be directed by will. They may come and go or vary greatly in power from day to day.

**Special:** This can be anything that suits the character's unique magical bent or the circumstances of Twilight.

## Story and Character Considerations for Twilight

Wizard's Twilight is a highly variable and personal event for every magus, and as such can add much to a story or character. You should feel free to alter the effects that the dice indicate, or make up your own effects when it is appropriate. The more effort both storyguide and player put into describing a given Twilight episode, the more it can fit the story and character involved. Set aside the rules if your troupe's imagination is more powerful.

One factor in effectively staging Twilight is timing. If an episode occurs during a battle, it is best to simply have the afflicted character fall into fits and leave it at that. Don't slow things down for the rest of the players. If, however, a magus experiences Twilight while the other characters are free to interact, you may wish to draw out the scene for full dramatic effect: the affected character fights for control while the others try to ease their fellow through the experience.

The immediate effects of Twilight are up to you, as storyguide. Sometimes the magus is simply knocked unconscious or paralyzed; at other times, he may suffer violent fits. Uncontrolled vis often leaks out of an afflicted magus, causing strange magical effects. Fit the nature of a given Twilight to the dramatic needs of the story and the atmosphere of the saga.

In addition, most Twilight episodes leave some kind of mark on the character, called the "touch of magic." This can be a physical discoloration, a quirk, or any other minor interesting detail. Again, this should suit the nature of the Twilight or of the character.

### Other Causes of Twilight

Wizard's Twilight does not always occur entirely by chance. It can be more common under certain rare conditions. Below are some examples.

**Powerful magical items:** These potent devices rely on the user's ability to control magic, so they can only be used by wizards. Their powers are so strong, however, that any botch made while wielding them causes a risk of Twilight.

**Magical traps:** A magus might inscribe a tome with a "spell" that actually sends anyone attempting to cast it into Twilight, as a trap for those who steal the book.

**Supernatural encounters:** Demons and faeries can use powers that do not mesh perfectly with Hermetic magic. Magi who are trying to discover the secrets of such beings may find themselves going through Twilight as a result.

## An Example of Wizard's Twilight

Erat Caecus faces a demon. Grabbing a handful of raw vis in the form of magical powder, he forgoes finesse and lets fly with a spontaneous Perdo Vim spell. The player rolls a 0, and since the powder contained seven points of raw vis, he must make eight botch rolls. Two of them come up 0, and the storyguide calls for a Twilight roll.

The roll is 1 and the reroll 9, yielding 18 + 8 (his previous Twilight total) = 28. As this total is over 24, Erat Caecus goes into Twilight. His player rolls for Twilight points, getting 2, for a new total of 10. The storyguide decides that the magus has accidentally made a supernatural connection with the demon, something few minds can survive without damage. Both fall to the ground, writhing, spitting, and screaming.

The storyguide rules that the longer it takes the other characters to kill the demon, the more intense the Twilight becomes, so he does not allow a roll for Twilight control yet. Dispatching the helpless demon takes long enough that the storyguide adds +1 to his Twilight intensity roll, to be made against Erat Caecus's control roll.

Some of the other characters try to aid the fallen magus, though he shows no response. One, a favored grog, tries talking to him, and the storyguide decides this can affect the magus's control of the experience (a very bad roll can hinder it, and a very good one can help). The grog's player makes a Communication roll and adds +3 for the strong friendship, but the total is still only 7—no effect.

Erat Caecus's player rolls 8 + 3 (Intelligence) = 11 for control, while the storyguide rolls 6 + 3 (Magic Aura rating) + 1 (demon's contact) = 10 for intensity. Since his roll was the higher, the player may roll for a good effect. A die roll is made to determine the result of the Twilight. The die comes up 4: experience points in an Affinity. The player and storyguide talk over the result.

It would be logical to give Erat Caecus experience with his Perdo Affinity, since he was attempting a destructive spell, but that does not take into account the unique contact with the demon. An Affinity with destroying demons makes sense, but overlaps with the existing Perdo Affinity. The storyguide finally lets the player decide between a +2 bonus for destroying demons (in addition to the Perdo Affinity) and experience in Occult Lore. The player decides that Erat Caecus would have spent more time focused on his destructive abilities than on the demon's nature, so picks the demon-slaying bonus.

## Experience and Advancement

A character's identity, outlook and competence change as the saga progresses. Experience points, which are spent to improve a character's statistics, are a palpable measure of this change. They can be gained in the significant encounters of a character's life, through interaction with the world, and through study or training.

All of the methods for gaining experience listed in this section (save for story experience) require full seasons of devotion to training, practice, study, or what have you. Characters so occupied may not spend more than ten days out of the season engaged in other activities. Exactly what counts as an "other activity" is up the storyguide. Traveling (unless part of the practice or training) and engaging in adventures almost certainly does. Guarding the covenant might not (especially if the character in question is training with arms in the courtyard), but the storyguide will want to take circumstances like those into account when thinking about the actual ability of the covenant to repel invaders or notice threats. Characters who have Virtues or Flaws that give them the obligation to spend a season or more each year in the service of some other party may not practice, train, or study in those seasons (unless the storyguide specifically rules otherwise), but may gain Knowledges through exposure.

### Using Experience Points

Experience points are used to increase Ability scores, accumulating until their total exceeds the current score by one. At that point the score increases by one and the accumulated experience points are cleared. Raising the score again requires accumulating enough points to exceed the new number. For example, say that a given character has the Skill Sing at a score of three. Experience in Singing will accumulate over time. When four experience points have accumulated, the character's Sing score becomes four, and his experience points in Sing are reset to zero.

A magus can also use experience points to Master spells (see "Mastering Spells" on [page 75](../page-refs/page-75.md)). This requires accumulating one experience point for every five levels of a spell. It is not necessary to exceed the spell level, as with an Ability score. When the necessary points accumulate the spell is mastered.

### Story Experience

At the end of each story, the storyguide determines how successful the characters were and to what extent their actions reflected their natures. They are then rewarded with experience points in proportion to their success and role-playing skill. There's no rule on the number of points you must award—it depends on how quickly you want characters to advance and on the magnitude of their accomplishments. Guidelines are provided below, but feel free to ignore them altogether and use your intuition to set the pace of advancement.

#### Story Magnitude

Guidelines for experience awards based on the danger and impact of the story are listed below. Remember that these are guidelines only, and should vary based on how quickly you would like the characters to advance.

**Trifling:** The story is a bit of a lark with no real dangers involved or no substantial knowledge gained. Such a story does not merit any experience point due to magnitude, though experience should still be awarded for roleplaying (as described below).

**Moderate:** The story involves a modicum of hardship and danger, and the characters were threatened with death or injury at least once. Stories where the lives or livelihoods of a few dozen people hang in the balance also fall into this category. Such stories are worth 1-2 experience points for magnitude.

**High:** Stories involving great danger to the characters or where large number of lives hang in the balance fall into this category. Such adventures are worth 2-3 experience points.

**Extreme:** If the characters faced death at every turn and their actions saved or affected the lives of entire populations, the story fits into this category. Appropriate awards for stories of this magnitude are 3 or more experience points.

#### Roleplaying

A character who was decently roleplayed should receive one experience point per story in addition to those given for success. Two points may be awarded for exceptional role-playing. A player who doesn't act much but who enthusiastically involves his character in ongoing activity should probably still get roleplaying experience, particularly for self-sacrifice to save the group.

#### Spending Story Experience

Experience earned after a story can only be spent on Abilities that the character used during that story, whether a roll was called for or not. For instance, leading a party through a wood requires appropriate forester skills, and even though die rolls may not have been required in the course of the story, experience points can be applied to appropriate Wilderness Skills. Even if a roll was involved, it need not have been successful—failure is often as instructive as success. Conversely, in order to spend experience on mastering a spell, a magus must have successfully cast that spell during the story.

A character can invest no more than one experience point in any given Ability per story.

### Training

A character may be trained in any Skill or Knowledge by a trainer who has a score of at least three and whose score exceeds the trainee's score. In one season of training, the trainee gains one experience point. The trainee receives one more experience point if his Intelligence is greater than zero, and one more experience point if the trainer's Communication is higher than zero (for a maximum gain of three experience points in one season). A trainer may teach a number of people equal to his Communication + Ability total simultaneously (though always at least 1).

Characters with the Gift may be trained in spells. The trainer must know the spells to be taught, and the total number of levels that can be taught in one season is the trainee's sum of (Technique + Form + Intelligence + Magic Theory) plus the trainer's Communication + Magic Theory. Spells of more than one Technique/Form combination can be trained, but then the total number of levels is limited by the lowest Technique/Form combination used. A trainer may only teach spells to one student at a time.

### Practice

A character who practices a Skill or Talent for a season may learn something even without formal training. If you already have at least one level in a Skill or Talent, you may declare you are spending a season practicing your ability. You should explain to the troupe what activities you are pursuing in order to practice it, such as working as the village blacksmith or hunting in the woods all summer. At the end of a season spent honing or using the Ability, roll a stress die. If the result you roll is three times your current level, you gain three experience points in it. If the result is twice your current level, gain two, and if it is only equal to or over your current level in that Skill, you gain one. A botch reflects a very poor season or a major mistake you made in practice which you waste the rest of the season making up for.

It is also possible to practice a spell and eventually master it (see "Mastering Spells" on [page 75](../page-refs/page-75.md)). A magus may dedicate a season to such practice, and at the end of the season, gains a number of experience points equal to his Intelligence towards mastering that spell.

### Exposure

A character can gain experience in Casual Knowledges simply through exposure over a period of time. For each season that a character is exposed to a Casual Knowledge on a daily basis, he gains two experience points in that Knowledge if he has a positive Intelligence, or one experience point otherwise. Exposure can never bring a character's score above four.

Exposure is subjective, and the storyguide is the final arbiter of what is appropriate exposure and what is not. As an example, living in a community where a given unfamiliar language is spoken and interacting with local folk on a daily basis would count as exposure to that language. Living in the same community, but studying obsessively in a University where only Latin is spoken would not be particularly worthwhile (at least as concerns learning the local language).

### Lectio

Lectio is formal teaching based around a text, and can only be used to teach Knowledges. Lectio is similar to giving a lecture, and thus many students may be taught at once. The limit is the teacher's Communication + Lectio total.

Each member of the audience generates a Study Total. This total is the teacher's Communication + Lectio, plus half the Quality of the book being read (round down), plus the student's Intelligence. A number of experience points equal to the Study Total divided by five (rounded up) is gained by each student.

A student can only learn from one season given by one teacher on one text. Further seasons on the same text must be by different teachers and further seasons by the same teacher must be on different texts.

### Disputatio

Disputatio is formal teaching of Arts and Knowledges based on the posing and answering of questions. A teacher may only teach one person at a time in this manner, and must have a score of at least five in the Art or three in the Knowledge to do so.

The student generates a Study Total equal to the teacher's Intelligence + Disputatio, plus the student's Intelligence + 6. For Arts, the student gains a number of experience points equal to the Study Total. For Knowledges, the number of experience points gained is the Study Total divided by five (rounded up). The maximum gain in one season is three full levels of an Art or Knowledge. In no case may a student exceed his trainer's score in the Art or Knowledge being taught. As long as the teacher has a higher score than the pupil, multiple seasons of teaching are profitable.

#### Summae

A *summa* (plural summae) is a work distilling all that a scholar knows about an Art or Knowledge into a single book. As such, they take a lot of effort to write but are very valuable for study. Each summa is described by two factors: its level, which represents how much knowledge is contained in it, and its Quality, representing how well it is written.

To convert texts from the third edition of *Ars Magica* to these rules, keep their level constant and give them a Quality equal to half their level. For example, an *Ignem* 12 text becomes an *Ignem* summa with level 12 and quality 6.

##### Writing Summae

When a summa is started, the level of the finished book is determined. The level may be chosen freely by the author, up to half of his score in the appropriate Art or Knowledge.

Once the level is determined, writing commences. For every season spent writing, the character accumulates a number of points equal to his Communication + Scribe. When the total of points equals or exceeds the level of the summa, it is complete. The level of the book may not be changed midway through the writing (if the character improves the Art or Knowledge, for example). Once begun, the book must be finished at the initial level or not finished at all.

Once finished, a Quality is assigned to the work. The Quality of the completed summa is equal to the author's Communication + Scribe + 3.

For example, Quintus, who has a score of 24 in *Ignem* and a Communications + Scribe of 5, wants to write an *Ignem* summa. He decides that the level of the summa will be twelve, the maximum that he can select. During the first season of writing he accumulates five points (his Communication + Scribe). He accumulates another five in the second season, taking him to ten, and five more in the third, for a total of fifteen. Fifteen is higher than twelve, so the book is completed in the third season. The Quality of the summa is 8 (his Communication + Scribe + 3).

Copying existing summa is not nearly as difficult or time consuming as writing them. A copyist may fully copy a number of levels of summa equal to his (Scribe + Dexterity) times 3 per season.

|  Summa Study Example  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Season | Ignem Score | Experience Points Toward Next Level  |
|  1 | 3 | 0*  |
|  2 | 5 | 5  |
|  3 | 7 | 6  |
|  4 | 9 | 3  |
|  5 | 10 | 7  |
|  6 | 11 | 10  |
|  7 | 12 | 0**  |
|  * Quinta can gain no more than 3 levels per season. If she could use her full 14 experience points, she would have a score of 4 with 4 extra experience points.  |   |   |
|  ** Quinta does not gain the full 14 experience points in season 7, because she cannot gain experience points that would bring her above level 12, the level of the summa she is studying.  |   |   |

##### Reading Summae

When reading a summa, the student generates a Study Total equal to his Intelligence + Concentration + the summa's Quality. For every season of study the student gains this number of experience points in an Art, or this number of experience points divided by five (rounded up) in a Knowledge. In no case may the student gain more than three full levels in an Art or Knowledge in a season. Excess experience points over those for the three levels are wasted.

A student may continue to study a summa as long as his score in the Art or Knowledge that it concerns is lower than the level of the text. Thus, a summa may be studied for several seasons with profit.

For example, Quinta, who has a score of 0 in *Ignem* and an Intelligence + Concentration total of 6, decides to study Quintus' summa, which has a level of 12 and a Quality of 8. She has a Study Total of 14 (her Intelligence + Scribe + the summa's quality), and thus gains 14 experience points per season. The chart summarizes her advancement by season.

### Libri Quaestionum

*Libri quaestionum* (singular liber quaesitonum—"Book of Questions") are written versions of disputatio. They consist of a series of questions and answers on a given topic, and are

<!-- End of page-184-188.md -->


<!-- Start of page-189-192.md -->

### Writing Libri Quaestionum

It takes one season to write a liber quaestionum. Each book has a Quality, representing how good it is, and a target level, the level of ability at which it is aimed. The Quality of a liber quaestionum is the author's Communication + Scribe + 6. The target level is selected by the author, and can be up to one third of the author's score in the subject of the book.

For example, Quintus decides to write a liber quaestionum about Ignem. He decides to have a target level of 8, the highest possible, so that it will be useful to those who have already studied his summa. It takes him one season, and the resulting liber quaestionum has a Quality of 11.

Copying libri quaestionum is not as time consuming as writing them. A copyist can make a number of copies of a given libri quaestionum equal to his Scribe skill in one season.

### Studying Libri Quaestionum

It takes one season to study a liber quaestionum, and a student may only study a liber quaestionum once, with benefit. The reader of the liber quaestionum generates a Study Total equal to Intelligence + Concentration + Quality – (5 times the difference between the reader's current score and the target level). Note that you may study a liber quaestionum if your score is higher than the target level. If the text is about an Art, the reader gains a number of experience points equal to the Study Total, with a maximum gain in one season of three full levels of Art score. If the text concerns a Knowledge, divide the Study Total by 5 (rounding up) and apply that many experience points. Again, the maximum gain in one season is three full levels.

For example, Tessa decides to study Quintus' liber quaestionum. Her score of 9 in Ignem is one level away from the target level of the book, so she has a -5 penalty to her study total. Her Study Total is 3 (her Intelligence) + 4 (her Concentration) + 11 (the Quality) - 5 (the difference in level) and so she gains 13 experience points.

## Full Level Advancement for Arts

It can be slightly complex to keep track of experience points for Arts, especially when high Art scores are involved. If your troupe wishes to avoid this complexity, you can use an alternate method to determine Art advancement (but you should still use the experience point system for Abilities). The systems listed below will produce results that approximate advancement by experience points as presented in nearby sections, but will vary somewhat. The entire troupe should decide to use either the experience point method or this optional method for the length of the saga.

To use the alternate method, calculate Study Totals as you do using the standard rules. Then simply follow the alternate method below.

**Disputatio**: If the Study Total is three times your Art score or greater, you gain three levels. If it is at least two times your Art score (but less than three times your score), you gain two levels. If your Study Total greater than your Art score (but less than two times your Art score), you gain one level.

**Summa**: If your Study Total is three times your Art score or greater, you gain three levels. If it is at least two times your Art score (but less than three times your score), you gain two levels. If your Study Total is less than two times your Art score, you gain one level. As with the experience point system, you cannot gain a higher score than the level of the book.

**Libri quaestionum**: Libri quaestionum do not work well if you are not using experience points for Arts. However, you could give levels in Arts equal to the magnitude of the Study Total. Be warned that this makes study faster at higher levels.

**Tractatus**: Tractatus do not work at all if you are not using experience points for Arts.

**Studying from Vis**: Compare the Study Total to your current Art score. If the Study Total is three times your Art score or greater, you gain three levels. If it is at least two times your Art score (but less than three times your score), you gain two levels. If your Study Total greater than your Art score (but less than two times your Art score), you gain one level.

### Tractatus

Tractatus (singular also tractatus) are texts that deal in depth with some aspect of an Art or Knowledge. Tractatus about Arts are written about a particular spell, while those concerning Knowledges are about some particular subject within that Knowledge. A tractatus is useful to students at any level of ability, because you can never know everything about your subject.

#### Writing Tractatus

It takes one season to write a tractatus. In order to write a tractatus on an Art, the author must first master a spell that uses that Art, and then write the tractatus about this spell. A magus may write only one tractatus about a given spell, and the tractatus will concern the Art (of the two relevant to the spell) in which the magus has the higher score.

The magnitude of the spell cannot be higher than the author's Communication + Scribe total. The Quality of the tractatus is equal to the magnitude of the spell. For a tractatus on a Knowledge, the Quality is simply the author's Communication + Scribe. A person can only write a number of tractatus on a Knowledge equal to half his score in the Knowledge, rounded down.

For example, Quintus decides to write a tractatus. He has mastered Ball of Abysmal Flame, but that is a seventh magnitude spell, higher than his Communication + Scribe total of 5, and so he cannot write about it. He has also mastered Arc of Fiery Ribbons, which is fifth magnitude, and so he writes about that. The tractatus has a Quality of 5, equal to the magnitude of the spell, and is about Ignem, as Quintus only has a score of 18 in Creo.

A copyist can make a number of copies of an existing tractatus equal to his Scribe score in one season.

#### Studying Tractatus

It takes one season to study a tractatus, and a given student may only study a given tractatus once, with benefit. The reader of a tractatus on an Art must already know the spell which the tractatus concerns, but need not have mastered it. It is not possible to learn a spell from a tractatus: the reader must have invented it himself, been taught it by another magus, or learnt it from a conventional spell text. The reader generates a Study Total equal to Intelligence + Concentration + Quality. If the book concerns an Art, he gets the Study Total in experience points. If it concerns a Knowledge, he gets experience points equal to the Study Total divided by 5 (rounded up).

For example, Quinta decides to study Quintus's tractatus. First, she learns Arc of Fiery Ribbons from the covenant library. She then spends a season studying the tractatus, gaining a study total of 11 (5 + 6). This gives her 11 experience points.

### Studying Vis

Vis is the raw stuff of magic, and study of it can reveal new insights about Hermetic magic. Magi can devote themselves to the study of vis in order to increase their Art scores or their knowledge of Magic Theory. In either instance, vis used in study is consumed in experimentation.

If you roll a zero when experimenting with vis, roll a number of botch dice equal to the number of pawns you studied. Whether or not you actually botch, you gain no experience points during a season where you rolled a zero. If you do botch, the storyguide may apply whatever botch results are deemed appropriate. If a botch demands a roll to avoid wizard's Twilight, add a simple die to the number of pawns of vis that were used to the strength of your aura to determine the strength of the supernatural power you must control.

#### Learning Arts from Vis

Magi may study Arts from raw vis. To do this, a magus must have some pawns of vis appropriate to the Art he wishes to study available. He may study from one, two, or three pawns, deciding on the number of pawns at the beginning of the season, before making the die roll. The player then rolls a stress die, multiplies it by the number of pawns studied, and then adds the covenant's aura to get a Study Total. The magus gains this many experience points in the Art, but can gain no more than three full levels. Excess points are lost.

For example, Quintus, with an Ignem score of 24 (and no experience points toward the next level), decides to study from Ignem vis. He chooses to study from three pawns, and his player rolls a one, followed by another one, followed by a nine, for a result of 36. He multiplies this by three (the number of pawns) to get 108. Adding his covenant's aura, 4, gives him a final total of 112. Advancing from a score of 24 to a score of 27 costs 25 + 26 + 27, or 78 experience points. The remaining 44 points are lost, as Quintus cannot gain more than three full levels in a season.

#### Learning Magic Theory from Vis

To increase your Magic Theory score, you can experiment with raw vis, whose properties give you insight into the nature of magic in general. When you study from vis, you must use either one, two, or three pawns. If you use one pawn, it may be of any variety. If you study from two pawns, one must correspond to a Technique, the other to a Form. You gain experience by observing the interactions of the two. If you study from three pawns, one must correspond to a Technique, the second must correspond to a Form, and the third can be of any type that is different from the first two.

Whenever you spend a season studying from vis, roll a stress die, multiply by the number of pawns used, and add the level of your magic Aura (usually the level of your covenant). If the result is at least triple your score in Magic Theory, you gain three experience points in Magic Theory. If it is at least double but not more than triple your score, you gain two experience points in Magic Theory. If it exceeds your score but does not exceed double your score, you gain one experience point. If your roll does not exceed your score you learn nothing from your experiments, and waste that season. Vis is always consumed by experimentation.

#### Experience in Magic Theory

Magi can gain experience in Magic Theory by designing things in accordance with Bonisagus's theories. For every season that a magus spends inventing a spell, investing an enchanted item, or making potions he also gains one experience point in Magic Theory, unless he was working from one of his own lab texts.

## Reputations

Reputations are concrete measurements of what a character is known for. Each Reputation is defined by a descriptor, like Insane or Brave, and a number, which can range from 1 to 10. The practical maximum for a reputation is about 5. Each Reputation should also specify the group of people that it affects. A given Reputation is usually noted like this: "Thief 3, among residents of Paris."

The number associated with the Reputation can be used as a modifier to die rolls when a character with a Reputation interacts with people who are affected by the Reputation. Whether the modifier is positive or negative depends both on what the reputation is for and who exactly is being affected. For example, the character with the reputation above would receive a -3 on rolls to convince the city guard that he was loitering "with no particular intent." It would apply as a bonus to convince underworld figures to cut the character in on a deal. Of course, not everyone you deal with will care about your Reputation. When negotiating a deal with a carpenter, it will make little difference that you have a Reputation as an adulterer.

Sometimes people are not aware of a Reputation that applies to them. For example, not every resident of Paris knows that the character from the example is a thief. When there is ambiguity about whether the character is known, make a simple roll and add the level of the Reputation. If the result is 6 or greater, the Reputation applies. Furthermore, in order for a Reputation to be taken into account, the people whom the character is interacting with must recognize the character for who he is.

Reputations are increased and decreased at the decision of the storyguide. For a Reputation to increase the character must perform some action that confirms and expands the depth of the Reputation, and news of that action must become widespread. The character with the Reputation “Thief 3, among residents of Paris” will not increase his Reputation by being caught picking pockets, because that is expected of him. On the other hand, his Reputation might increase if he steals something very valuable, or commits some other high profile crime. Of course, if he was successful in stealing something of great worth and no one found out about it, his Reputation would not increase, because news that he did it would not be widespread. Reputations are decreased in the same way, save that the actions performed must run contrary to the Reputation.

## Confidence

Confidence represents a character's solid belief in his ability to accomplish his goals. It is measured in points. Most of the people in Mythic Europe have one Confidence point. Most characters begin the game with three.

Characters can use Confidence to help them succeed at tasks. Any time you must make a stress roll to succeed in some action, you may put Confidence into the action, adding +1 for each point you expend. If you succeed, no points are lost and you can use them again later. If you fail, you lose those points temporarily, gaining them back in a week or two, or when you succeed at some vitally important task without using Confidence.

If you ever use Confidence and your total score to perform the action comes out to exactly what you needed, immediately make a simple roll. If your roll exceeds your Confidence (including any points temporarily lost), you permanently gain one Confidence.

If you should happen to botch while using Confidence, you lose a Confidence point permanently (though you cannot lose your last point this way). The only way to drop to 0 Confidence is to suffer extended dehumanizing treatment, like slavery or torture, or to experience something that destroys your will to live, like losing your true love.

## Travel

Travel time between important scenes is generally played through quickly. If little of interest happens on the road, you don't want to waste time detailing every moment of the journey. The rules below determine how long it takes for characters to get somewhere, and how tired they are afterwards.

First rate the difficulty of travel according to the categories listed below, based on the terrain and weather. Travel is at the pace of the slowest member of the group.

**Easy:** The best (and rarest) of circumstances, such as a straight, level Roman road with a gentle breeze at the characters' backs.

**Light:** A combination of the best weather travelers can realistically hope for, and a good road (by medieval standards).

**Medium:** Typical conditions for travel, on a rocky road with holes and ruts caused by rain and heavy wagons. This could also describe travel on a better road with unfavorable weather conditions, such as heat or snow, or travel through a moderately dense forest with a competent guide.

**Hard:** Travel on a typical road with less than favorable weather, or unescorted travel through the wilderness.

**Very Hard:** Unbearable weather, such as a blizzard or hurricane, or horrible terrain, such as a sloping rock field.

**Terrible:** Both harsh weather and hazardous terrain. One does not usually travel under such conditions, as fatalities can result.

|  Travel Chart  |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Difficulty | Foot | Horse | Wagon  |
|  Easy | 25/1 | 30/1 | 15  |
|  Light | 20/2 | 25/1 | 10  |
|  Medium | 15/2 | 20/1 | 8  |
|  Hard | 10/3 | 12/2 | 3  |
|  Very Hard | 5/3 | 3/2 | —  |
|  Terrible | 2/3 | 1/2 | —  |

The number before the slash is the number of miles traveled in an eight hour traveling day, assuming several rest stops. The number after the slash is the number of Fatigue levels lost. Generally, these fatigue levels must be slept off.

For each day of travel, each character (or horse) rolls a stress die + Stamina. On a 6 or greater, one less Fatigue level than normal is lost. On a botch, some traveling misfortune occurs, such as an injury.
