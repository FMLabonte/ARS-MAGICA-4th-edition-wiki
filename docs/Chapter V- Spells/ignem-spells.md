# Ignem Spells
As fire is volatile and dangerous, so are these spells. Magi who pursue the Art of fire do so with fine regard for the dangers and powers involved, for fire is both dangerous and mighty, to friend and foe alike. Storyguides should make Ignem botches particularly deadly.

Light and heat also fall within the domain of this Form. It's important to remember that heat also includes relative absence of heat, so spells that result in cold temperatures are possible through Ignem.

The standard targets correspond to different sizes of fires. Candles, torches, and small campfires are Small targets, large campfires and bonfires are Individual-sized targets, and house fires are Structure sized targets. Unless specified otherwise, a spell that can affect one type of fire can affect smaller fires as well. Fire damage is explained on [p. 180](../page-refs/page-180.md).

## Creo Ignem Guidelines
Spells that create fires are versatile weapons—destructive to living things, undead, buildings, and morale. Those who depend on fire spells, however, risk botching. Fire is an unforgiving element for those who lose control of it, and self incineration is always a possibility.

Typical sigils seen in Creo Ignem spells involve the flame being a specific color or shape, or giving off an unusual smell.

The basic range is Near, the basic duration is Momentary, boosted duration is usually Permanent, and the basic target is Small.

**Level 1:** Ignite something extremely flammable (like oil or a wick). Illuminate an area as if by moonlight. Heat an object so that it is warm to the touch.

**Level 3:** Ignite something very flammable (like parchment). Illuminate an area as if by candlelight. Heat an object to be hot to the touch.

**Level 5:** Create a fire intense enough to do +5 damage (a Small flame can only affect a single target). Ignite something flammable (like dry wood or charcoal). Illuminate an area as if by torchlight. Heat an object enough to boil water.

**Level 10:** Create a fire doing +5 damage in an unnatural shape (like a ring or sheet). Create a fire doing +10 damage. Ignite something slightly flammable (like damp wood or leather). Illuminate an area as if by daylight on a cloudy day. Heat an object enough to make it glow red-hot.

**Level 15:** Create a fire doing +10 damage in an unnatural shape. Create a fire doing +15 damage. Ignite something barely flammable (like a human body). Illuminate an area as if by full sunlight. Heat an object enough to melt lead.

**Level 20:** Create a fire doing +20 damage. Heat an object enough to melt steel.

**Level 25:** Create a fire doing +25 damage.

**Level 30:** Create a fire doing +30 damage.

### Creo Ignem Spells

#### Moonbeam
R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Quartz (+5)

Causes a gentle light, bright enough to read by, to shine down from above and illuminate the area described by your encircled arms. Lasts as long as you hold your arms in a circle. Quartz is a rock associated with the moon.

### Level 5

#### Palm of Flame
R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Piece of Flint (+1)

A flame leaps up in your palm, which must be upturned for the spell's duration. The flame does +10 damage to anyone else that touches it.

### Level 10

#### Heat of the Searing Forge
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Chrysolite (+3)

Heats a piece of metal so that it is too hot to touch. Something the size of a breastplate or helmet does +5 damage if in direct contact with the skin for one round. For each additional round, more damage is done, the amount dropping by two points each round (+3 damage on round two, then +1). Smaller objects do less damage. Most metal armor has leather or cloth underneath that gives the victim a +3 Soak bonus against the heat. Chrysolite is a rock having strong associations with the Sun.

#### Lamp Without Flame
R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room

Spell Focus: Lantern Oil (+1)

Illuminates the room that you are in with a light equal to torch or lamp light, as long as you concentrate. When using lantern oil, you spread it over some object, and the light emanates from that object. When cast outside, this spell illuminates an area about 5 paces across.

### Level 15

#### Flash of the Scarlet Flames
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Aimed: -3

Spell Focus: Flint (+1)

A brilliant red flash explodes in the air where you designate. If you target a person's face (which requires a targeting roll), the target needs a Stamina stress roll of 9+ to avoid temporary blindness. If the target botches the roll, he is permanently blinded. If temporarily blinded, he can try to make a simple Stamina roll of 9+ each minute to recover. The flash is equivalent to looking straight at the sun.

In Rose of Jerbiton's version of this spell, there is a faint odor of roses in the area where the flash explodes.

### Level 20

#### Blade of the Virulent Flame
R: Reach/Near, D: Spec, T: Small

Spell Focus: The Blood of a Fire Drake (+3)

Forms a fire along the length of a metal blade. This flame doubles the weapon damage score for the blade (or adds +6, whichever is greater), and can start fires as well. After half an hour, the blade becomes so hot that it begins to melt. Once this occurs, the spell ends. The user of the flaming blade must wear gloves as the hilt gets hot, or else the sword cannot be handled. If using the spell focus, you spread the blood along the blade. The +3 focus modifier is also added to damage caused by the blade, because the fire is hotter and more intense.

#### Pilum of Fire
R: Spec, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: +1

Spell Focus: A Javelin (+1)

A 2-foot, thick, spear-shaped jet of fire flies from your palms (consuming your spell focus, if you are using one), doing +25 damage. One point less is done for each pace of distance between you and your target. Beyond 25 paces, the flames dissipate.

### Level 25

#### Arc of Fiery Ribbons
R: Spec, D: Mom, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Yellow Diamond (+1)

A dozen multi-hued ribbons of flame leap from your hands and fly out 15 paces, covering a 60-degree arc. All those in the arc take +20 damage, modified by 1 for every pace of distance between you and the target. The area affected by this spell is so broad that targeting rolls are only necessary in exceptional circumstances. Targets who sees the ribbons coming can fall flat and therefore suffer half damage. A Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 18 or better is required to do this, though a +1 bonus applies for every pace between the target and caster. If this escape roll botches, the target suffers an extra +5 damage. The yellow diamond has associations with the Sun.

### Level 35

#### Ball of Abysmal Flame
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: The Heart of a Fire Drake (+3)

This spell creates an apple-sized ball of fire in your hand. When you throw it (up to the range of the spell), it bursts into flame as soon as it hits something, doing +30 damage. Anyone within 5 paces who looks at the burst must make a Stamina stress roll of 12+ or be blinded for one round (or permanently on a botched roll). You can hold the ball in your hand for up to three rounds before throwing it. After three rounds, it flickers out.

Marius of Tremere's version of the spell causes the ball to make a loud bang when it hits the target. His sigil is a gaudiness in his spells.

#### Circle of Encompassing Flames
R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+1)

Creates a circle of flames 6 feet high. A Targeting roll is needed to encircle someone. The circle begins at a 1-pace radius, but you can make it shrink to a pillar or grow to a 3-pace radius as you concentrate if you cast with a Rego requisite. Anyone moving through the flames takes +20 damage. You cannot move the center of the circle. The cat's-eye gem is associated with the sun.

## Intéllego Ignem Guidelines
Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small.

**Level 4:** Sense one property of a fire. Locate a fire.

**Level 5:** Sense all mundane properties of a fire. Become aware of all fires within the target area. See a fire with which you have an arcane connection.

**Level 10:** Sense all mundane properties of ash. See a fire you have an arcane connection to and all things it illuminates (for example, see a campfire and everything within its circle of light).

**Level 15:** See clearly through raging fire (an Auram requisite may be necessary if smoke is present as well). Learn the magical properties of a fire.

**Level 25:** Speak with a fire.

### Intéllego Ignem Spells

#### Tales of the Ashes
R: Touch/Near, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+3)

Lets you see what the ashes you touch originally were, and how and when the object was burned, as long as the object is no larger than Small. The latter two are divined from markings and signs in the ashes.

#### Shadows of the Fires Past
R: Per/Sight, D: Conc, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Lump of Coal (+1)

Allows you to see where fires have been in the past lunar month. Each casting allows you to detect a single fire—the most recent that you do not already know about. A light red flickering haze appears where the fire was, and you gain an intuitive sense of when the fire was there. This spell does not look into the past, but detects the traces of fire. This spell can be cast outdoors, in which case it detects fires in a room-sized area adjudicated by the storyguide.

### Level 20

#### Vision of Heat's Light
R: Per, D: Sun/Moon, T: Sight

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+3)

Allows you to see the heat of objects that are of human body temperature or hotter. Excellent for use in the dark, but it doesn't give true vision.

### Level 25

#### Words of the Flickering Flame
R: Reach/Near, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: Ashes in Mouth (+3)

Allows you to converse with a fire, commonly very chaotic and distractible. Promising a fire more fuel might keep its interest. Fires are mostly aware of what they've burned, but they have a limited awareness of what goes on around them as well.

### Level 35

#### Eyes of the Flame
R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Lets you see a fire up to the size of a large campfire to which you have an arcane connection. You can also see all those things which the fire illuminates.

## Muto Ignem Guidelines
Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 3:** Change one characteristic of a fire within the target area (for example, make a fire burn more brightly, or produce more smoke).

**Level 4:** Totally change a fire into another natural fire (changing any or all of its characteristics).

<!-- End of page-132-136.md -->


<!-- Start of page-137-141.md -->

### Muto Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Change a fire so that it is slightly unnatural (for example, make the flames colored, or make the smoke smell of roses). May require requisites.

**Level 10:** Change a fire so that it is completely unnatural (for example, multicolored flames that form images while the popping of the fire plays music). Often requires requisites.

**Level 15:** Change a fire into natural air (Auram requisite).

**Level 20:** Change a fire into a natural solid (Terram requisite). Change a fire into slightly unnatural air.

**Level 30:** Change a fire into a natural liquid (Aquam requisite). Change a fire into very unnatural air.

#### The Many-Hued Conflagration
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+5)

Makes a fire burn brightly in shifting colors for an instant. Each being looking at the fire must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or be blinded for one round by the multicolored lights.

#### Show of the Flames and Smoke
R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Multi-Colored Streamers (+3)

Causes smoke of different colors, streams of flame, and strange popping and sizzling noises to come from a fire. The effect is so spectacular that onlookers are either entranced or horrified, depending on the circumstances. The pyrotechnics might ignite nearby flammable objects and cause minor burns to those within 2 paces of the fire.

#### Hornet Fire
R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Stinging Insect (+1)

Requisite: Rego

Turns a fire into a swarm of fireballs, each the size of a large insect, that fly and harass at your command. Their burning touch gives all those you indicate within 7 paces of the fire both a –3 penalty on all rolls and two extra botch dice. If using the focus, you throw the stinging insect into the fire.

#### Prison of Flames
R: Reach/Far, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Small Iron Cage (+1)

Turns a bonfire into a prison shaped like a miniature castle. A person thrown into the middle is not burned, but takes +25 damage if he or she tries to escape.

#### Trapping the Fire
R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Requisite: Terram

This spell turns the heat and flames of a large campfire or bonfire into a small, very hard object, such as a gem or a piece of metal. If the object is broken, the flame returns, but dies if there is nothing to burn.

#### Flames of Sculpted Ice
R: Near/Sight, D: Spec, T: Str

Spell Focus: Essence of a Water Elemental (+3)

Requisite: Terram

Turns a fire up to the size of a small house into ice. The ice forms beautiful sculptures of leaping flame, until it begins to melt. When the ice has melted halfway, the flames start again, but probably won't spread, because of wet surroundings.

### Perdo Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Momentary (the thing destroyed will not return except by natural processes), and basic target is Small.

**Level 3:** Greatly reduce the amount of light in an area.

**Level 4:** Completely extinguish all light in an area.

**Level 5:** Extinguish a fire, cooling the ashes to merely warm. Chill an object.

**Level 10:** Strongly chill an object. Destroy one aspect of a fire (for example, heat or light).

#### Soothe the Raging Flames
R: Reach/Far, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Chrysolite (+5)

Eradicates the heat of a bonfire, which, however, continues to burn until the fuel already covered in flame is consumed. The flames do not spread, or harm anything beyond what they were already burning. If the chrysolite spell focus is used, it is crushed during the casting of the spell. If the fire is extinguished and relit, it will burn hot again, as it is now a different fire.

#### Winter's Icy Touch
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Garnet (+5)

Causes the target to feel a chill and lose body heat. A Stamina stress roll of 9+ is required, or a Fatigue level is lost. If used, the garnet is crushed during the casting of the spell. Garnets provide protection against illness, so destroying one sympathetically helps the spell.

#### Conjuration of the Indubitable Cold
R: Reach/Far, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Garnet (+3)

Cools the air in the targeted room (or within 10 paces of the target outside), leaving it a little below freezing. All nonliving things are chilled thoroughly, not just on the surface. All living things (except you, if you cast with a Rego requisite) lose one Fatigue level and must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ to avoid losing a second. House fires become as small as campfires, bonfires become as small as torch fires, and campfires and smaller fires go out.

#### Well Without Light
R: Reach/Far, D: Ring/Perm, T: Circle

Spell Focus: Black Onyx (+1)

Removes light from the target area. Only spells greater than level 25 can create light within this area. When casting this spell, magi typically clench a hand into a fist, possibly grasping a black onyx, and the light flows into the fist like a living entity, until the entire area is dark. The black onyx is a stone commonly associated with darkness and death.

#### Wizard's Eclipse
R: Sight, D: Diam, T: Bound, Ritual

The sun is eclipsed within the target area, making it as dark as night. The darkness begins very suddenly—the superstitious are likely to panic, especially if they see that there is normal daylight just beyond the boundary of the spell.

---

### Rego Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small.

The intensity of a fire also affects the difficulty of controlling it. Add a fire's (damage bonus – 5) to the level of a spell to control a fire.

**Level 5:** Control a fire in a natural fashion (for example, control its direction of spread).

**Level 10:** Control a fire in a slightly unnatural fashion (for example, stop it from burning a person).

**Level 20:** Control a fire in a very unnatural fashion (for example, fashion into a dancing humanoid shape).

#### Tremulous Vault of the Torch's Flame
R: Reach/Near, D: Mom, T: Small

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+5)

Causes a torch fire to quiver a few seconds and then make a leap of up to 10 feet in any direction. A targeting roll is required to hit a specific target. The flame stays at the spot it hits if it can burn there (see rules for fire damage on [page 180](../page-refs/page-180.md)). Otherwise, it simply scorches the spot and goes out (doing +5 damage).

#### Light Shaft of the Night
R: Far/Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Quartz (+5)

Collects moonbeams and starlight into a single vertical shaft of soft, silvery light that moves under your control. It illuminates an area 15 paces across with light nearly equal to sunlight (if the moon is out) or moonlight (if the moon is not out). If the sky is overcast, the spell does not work. Can only be cast under the night sky.

#### Leap of the Fire
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: +2

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+3)

Causes a bonfire to make a leap of up to 10 paces in any direction, where it catches if there is fuel, or burns out if there is none. Make Targeting roll to hit a target; the flames do +10 damage.

#### Burst of the Sweeping Flames
R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+3)

This spell causes a fire to explode outwards from its source along the ground, as if a giant wind were blowing on it from above. The fire travels for no more than 10 paces, but it ferociously ignites anything in its path. The original fire is left dead, but in all probability a number of new fires will be started. The flames cause +5 to +20 damage, depending on the size of the original fire.

#### Ward Against Heat and Flames
R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Scale of a Flame Drake (+3)

Keeps heat and fire at bay, unable to approach within 1 pace of the target. This renders the target immune to damage from flames or heat of intensity less than that of a house fire. The target gets a +15 Soak against all fire-related damage. Any fire that is smaller than a house fire in intensity (that is, has equal to or less than a +15 damage bonus) doesn't penetrate the ward. Such fires simply dim at the protected person's passing and flare back up after he or she is gone.
