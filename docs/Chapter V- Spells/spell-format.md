# Spell Format

Each spell has several factors that describe it for game use. They are depicted in the diagram on this page and discussed below.

## Technique and Form

The Technique and Form are listed in the heading the spell is found under. Spells are arranged first by their Forms, then by their Techniques, in alphabetical order. Following each Technique/Form heading are guidelines that will help you create your own spells, as well as help you determine the necessary level to cast a spontaneous spell. Furthermore, each combination of Technique and Form lists the default ranges, durations, and targets that characterize that combination.

Techniques and Forms are often abbreviated by the first two letters of each word; thus a MuTe spell is of Muto Technique and Terram Form. The level is often added after the abbreviation—thus Flash of the Scarlet Flames becomes CrIg 15.

## Title

The titles given are the actual names of spells as known by Hermetic magi. When inventing new spells, try to give them creative names that will add color to the game. "Fireball" is not interesting; "Ball of Abysmal Flame" is—you get the idea.

## Level

Most spells are assigned a level, which is usually a multiple of five. A 5th level spell is very weak, a 15th level spell is of moderate power, and a 30th level spell is quite powerful.

Some spells are General spells (abbreviated to Gen), which means that they may be learned at any level of difficulty—the higher the level, the more powerful the spell. You may even learn General spells at levels that are not multiples of 5.

The level at which you know a General level formulaic or ritual spell depends on where you obtained it. If you learned a General level spell that was designed for effectiveness at level 15, then that is the level at which you know it. You cannot produce effects that exceed level 15 effects with that spell unless you invent a version with a higher level or learn such a version from another source. General level spells are open-ended only in the sense that they may be learned at any level. They may not be used at a level higher (or lower) than that which is known.

## Ranges, Durations, Targets

The range, duration, and target of a spell determine what it can affect. The range governs how far the target can be from the magus, the duration determines how long the target will be affected, and the target describes what the spell can affect. Each parameter has a number of possible ratings, which can be arranged in order from least difficult to produce to most difficult to produce. This is done in the chart below. Parameters which are listed together below but are separated by a slash (like Touch/Eye) represent different actual ranges that share the same level of difficulty. They are not interchangeable, simply equivalent.

In the spell descriptions, two ranges, durations, or targets separated by a slash are commonly listed for spells. The first range or durations is the one that is normally used, while the second (or "boosted") one is the range or duration that is used if vis is expended when the spell is cast. See "Using Raw Vis" on [page 77](../page-refs/page-77.md).

Each category of range, duration, and target is described below.

### Ranges

**Personal**: The effect of the spell is centered on the casting magus. The amount affected depends on the effect of the spell.

**Touch/Eye**: Touch: The magus or anything he touches, whether a person or thing. Eye: The magus may target any person or creature that he has established eye contact with. (Touch and Eye are the same "level" of range.)

**Reach**: Anything that the magus could touch (but is not necessarily touching) without moving substantially. Anything within roughly two paces.

**Near**: Anything within fifteen paces of the magus.

**Far**: Anything within a hundred paces of the magus.

**Sight**: Anything that the magus can see. If the magus is standing on the highest point for miles, this range can be immense.

**Arcane Connection**: Anything that the magus has an arcane connection to. Distance is immaterial unless the storyguide chooses to impose some limit. Such limits are usually provided in the example spells. Note that while Arcane Connection is a range, it is different from a physical item that is an arcane connection. This distinction is important, because some spells require that the caster have an arcane connection, but the spell must be cast as some range other than Arcane Connection.

|  Ranges (from low to high) | Durations (from low to high) | Targets (from low to high)  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  • Personal | • Momentary | • Small  |
|  • Touch/Eye | • Concentration/Diameter | • Individual  |
|  • Reach | • Sun | • Group/Room  |
|  • Near | • Moon/Ring | • Circle/Structure  |
|  • Far | • Season | • Boundary  |
|  • Sight | • Year | • Sight  |
|  • Arcane Connection | • Perm/Inst |   |

### Durations

**Momentary**: The spell lasts but a moment and then dissipates. Any effect that it has remains, however. This is the normal duration for combat spells.

**Concentration/Diameter**: Concentration: The spell lasts as long as the magus concentrates. Diameter: The spell lasts for the time that the sun takes to move its diameter in the sky—almost exactly two minutes. (Diameter and Concentration are the same "level" of duration.)

**Sun**: The spell lasts until the sun next rises or sets.

**Ring/Moon**: Ring: The spell lasts until the target of the spell moves outside a ring drawn at the time of casting, or until the ring is physically broken. Moon: The spell lasts until both the new and full moon have been in the sky. (Moon and Ring are the same "level" of duration.)

A ring must actually be drawn while the spell is being cast. The magus may use magic to do so, but that magic must not have a range greater than Touch, and the magus must physically trace out the ring. The casting of a non-Ritual spell may be extended out to allow the drawing of a large ring. However, the caster must make Concentration + Intelligence rolls of 6+ every round to maintain concentration on the spell, and if someone breaks the ring at any point before it is completed, the spell automatically botches. Really large rings are unlikely to be worth the risk.

**Season**: The spell lasts until the next solstice or equinox after its casting.

**Year**: The spell lasts until the fourth equinox or solstice after its casting.

**Permanent/Instant**: Permanent: The spell lasts forever, but remains forever magical. Thus, it could be dispelled at some point in the future. This duration is only available for spells which have magical effects: natural effects are Instant duration instead. Instant: The spell effect persists for ever as a mundane thing. It cannot be magically dispelled, although it can be destroyed by any method which would destroy the mundane thing that it is. This duration is only available for spells which have natural effects. Note also that this duration cannot be attained for magical creation or healing without the use of raw vis. (Permanent and Instant are the same "level" of effect.)

### Target

**Small**: Affects a small item, something a person of average strength could comfortably hold or carry with both hands.

**Individual**: The spell can affect a single discrete thing, such as one person or one object. A huge boulder is a discrete object, a mountain is not (because it is joined to the ground).

**Group/Room**: Group: The spell can affect a small group of people or things. There should be no more than about a dozen things, and they must be an obvious group. Three grogs huddled together or a ring of standing stones are a group: six people out of a crowd are usually not. Room: The spell affects a chamber and everyone or thing within it. This room can be very large (the nave of a cathedral, for instance, or a natural cave), but it must be enclosed and have definite boundaries. A courtyard would often count, a valley would not. (Group and Room are the same "level" of effect.)

**Circle/Structure**: Circle: The spell affects everything within a ring drawn by the magus at the time of casting, and ends if the circle is broken, irrespective of the nominal duration of the spell. See Ring, above, for restrictions on drawing the circle. Structure: The spell affects a single structure and everything within it. The structure can range in size from a hut to a castle, but it must be a single, linked edifice. As a rule of thumb, if it is all covered by one roof, it is one structure, but storyguide discretion applies. (Circle and Structure are the same "level" of effect.)

**Boundary**: The spell affects everything within a well-defined natural or man-made boundary. This could be the wall of a city, the edge of a village, the shores of a lake, the edge of a forest, or the bottom of a mountain. Since the ocean is not obviously bounded, it cannot be affected in this way. The magus must be able to see most of the bounded area unless the spell is being cast at Arcane Connection range.

**Sight**: The spell affects everything within sight of the caster.

## Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets

Each combination of Technique and Form lists default ranges, durations, and targets for those spells. These are known as the basic range, basic duration, and basic target. These are used to determine the level of newly created spells, or of spontaneous spells.

To calculate the level for a spell using those Arts but with different characteristics, refer to the lists above. For every step by which a category is raised, add five levels to the level of the spell. For every step by which one is lowered, subtract five levels. If subtractions take the level below five, subtract single levels instead. No spell can be lowered below level 1.

For example, consider a level 15 spell with range Reach, duration Sun, and target Group. A variant with the same effect but with range Near, duration Ring, and target Room would be level 25 (+5 to increase range Reach to Near, +5 to increase duration Sun to Ring, and no change for changing the target Group to Room, because they are at the same level). A different variant with range Personal, duration Concentration, and target Individual would be level 3 (-10 to decrease range Reach to Personal, -5 to decrease duration Sun to Conc, and -5 to decrease target Group to Individual). Note that since -10 takes the level from 15 to 5, the additional -10 only lowers the level by -1 per -5.

The storyguide may always intervene and declare that a certain combination of range, duration, target, and effect warrants a higher or lower level than that described by the guidelines and the system above.

The categories described here were built into the structure of Hermetic magic by Bonisagus. All spontaneous spells must conform to these requirements (the magus is making the spell up on the fly—he cannot also push the limits of magic theory). Formulaic spells, on the other hand, can be invented with ranges, durations or targets that are not listed here. This is usually slightly more difficult than if the closest category were used, but is largely left to storyguide interpretation.

## Ritual

Spells requiring rituals are those that fall outside the categories for listed for formulaic and spontaneous spells described under "Casting Ritual Spells" on [page 69](../page-refs/page-69.md). Certain powerful spells and spells inherited from the Cult of Mercury are also Ritual spells. Storyguides should use their discretion in declaring other spells Ritual.

## Requisites

Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have greater knowledge. See "Requisites" on [page 71](../page-refs/page-71.md) for a full description of how they limit the casters of particular spells. Requisites that always apply are listed along with a spell's statistics. Casting requisites are listed within the body of the spell description.

## Aimed

Spells that affect targets indirectly (that is, spells that use a medium, like fire, to strike the target) require Targeting rolls. Such spells are labeled "Aimed," and list a modifier to Targeting rolls when appropriate. See "Targeting" on [page 71](../page-refs/page-71.md).

## Spell Focus

Most formulaic spells list some spell focus that aids in the casting of the spell. When such a focus is used, a variable bonus, which is listed, is gained on the spellcasting roll. These spell foci are based upon both the Law of Sympathy and the lore of Mythic Europe. See "Spell Foci" on [page 77](../page-refs/page-77.md) for more details.

## Description

Describes the effects of the spell. Descriptions cover about 95% of the circumstances in which spells are used, but since magic is variable, unpredictable, and can be used in a number of ways, the responsibility for determining the effects in unusual situations lies with the storyguide.

Many of the spell descriptions include visual descriptions, hand gestures, spell foci, and wizard's sigils. It should be noted that these are all examples and that you shouldn't feel bound by them. In fact, you should customize all your spells in ways appropriate to your own magus. When you give special details to your own customized versions of these spells, you are rewarded with more a interesting game.

## Natural Resistance

Circumstances where natural resistance rolls are allowed are detailed in spell descriptions. Natural resistance rolls are most often Stamina, Size, or Intelligence stress rolls.

## Notes on Techniques

### Creo

A Creo spell might grow back a severed hand or create a bird, but it cannot grow wings on a person (that would be a Muto spell). Things created are either independent or a natural part of a larger being or object. Independent objects usually appear in your hand or directly in front of you.

You cannot create things inside of people to harm or kill them, nor can you perform other tricky maneuvers unless a spell specifies you can. Nothing created by magic is ever permanent unless vis is used to extend the duration of the spell.

### Intellego

Intéllego lets you perceive things or see through them. An Intéllego Terram spell, for instance, can let you see through walls. Intéllego cannot affect the subject of its spells (the person or thing you're watching), save that those who are sensitive to magic (for example, those with magic resistance) might realize they are being spied on with it. Intéllego spells are always of limited duration, even when extended with vis.

### Muto

There are two types of Muto spells, those that change the shape of an object and those that change the substance of an object. Although Muto spells are normally of limited duration when vis is not used, the shape of an object may be permanently changed if the substance is altered, because although the original substance eventually returns, the shape may not. For example, a Muto Terram spell can be cast to change a stone wall into dirt, which falls to the ground. The dirt eventually becomes stone again, but is now a pile of stone, instead of the wall it once was.

Muto spells that change the size or weight of a target cannot be used multiple times in order to cause the target to continue to change. A spell that doubles a creature's size, for instance, doubles its normal size, not its current size. To triple a creature's size, a more powerful spell is needed.

### Perdo

Most Perdo spells affect their targets directly, using no intervening medium. Therefore, targeting rolls are rarely needed. Perdo spells with the duration momentary destroy something in a moment. The duration does not describe how long the object is destroyed, as the effects of the destruction last until the target regenerates itself (which could very well be never).

### Rego

A Rego spell does not change the target, it merely moves or controls it. For instance, you can slam someone into a wall with a Rego spell. The easiest way to move things is to move the whole object evenly. To spin the object or to move just part of it is usually more difficult.

### The Wizard's Sigil

When you invent a spell, some amount of your personal magical style is likely to manifest itself, giving the spell some small quirk or minor detail that identifies it as yours. This recurrent mark or quirk in a magus's spell (which doesn't usually change the effectiveness of the spell) is termed his "wizard's sigil." Once known, these quirks can identify certain magi as having cast certain spells. Throughout this chapter, various sample spell sigils are listed in the descriptions. Keep in mind that these are just guidelines. They're meant to give you ideas to better personalize your spells, and perhaps to aid you in choosing your own sigil.
