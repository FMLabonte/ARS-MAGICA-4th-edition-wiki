# Terram Spells

Terram spells, in addition to covering earth, stone, clay, metal, and glass, can sometimes affect inanimate objects in general. For instance, Wielding the Invisible Sling (ReTe 10) throws all manner of nonliving things.

Though Terram spells affect all manner of solid objects, it is harder to affect certain materials: Here, in increasing order of difficulty, are the materials Terram spells affect: earth (sand, dirt, mud), clay, stone, glass, metal, gemstones. Each level of difficulty does not necessarily represent an increase in one level of magnitude.

## Creo Terram Guidelines

Creating earth in an elaborate shape or with some unnatural property is one level of magnitude higher than the listed guidelines.

Wizard's sigils commonly visible in Creo Terram spells involve the object created being bizarre in some way, such as dirt being a specific color or texture.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

Level 5: Create an amount of sand, dirt, mud, or clay.

Level 10: Create an amount of stone or glass.

Level 15: Create an amount of metal or a rough gemstone.

Level 20: Create an amount of polished gemstone.

An elaborately carved tower, formed from a single block of stone, rises out of the ground. The tower stands 80 feet high and is 30 feet wide, with a foundation set 20 feet into the ground. You determine the design of the chambers within.

#### Level 40

##### Opening the Earth's Pore

**R:** Sight, **D:** Moon, **T:** Spec, **Ritual**

Those in the immediate vicinity (30 paces) of the pore are struck by hot lava and sustain +20 damage each round; those not in the immediate vicinity can outrun the lava flow. The lava spill covers the land within 1 mile of the pore, doing damage, as described, each round to anyone caught in it.

### Intéllego Terram Spells

#### Level 4

##### Probe for Pure Silver

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom/Conc, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** A Chip of Silver (+3)

You are guided by a hunch to any silver nearby.

#### Level 10

##### Eyes of the Eons

**R:** Sight, **D:** Mom/Conc, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** A sapphire (+3)

Determines the age of any nonliving target to within 10% of its actual age.

#### Level 20

##### Eyes of the Treacherous Terrain

**R:** Sight, **D:** Mom/Conc, **T:** Bound

**Spell Focus:** A Troll's Eye (+3)

You can tell intuitively if any natural terrain you see is treacherous, such as if a rock field is prone to sliding.

##### The Miner's Keen Eye

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom/Conc, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** A Dwarf's Eye (+3)

You can see any one type of mineral (gold, diamond, sand), specified at the time of casting, through up to 3 paces of intervening material. You have a good idea of how much is there and how pure it is, if appropriate.

#### Level 25

##### Tracks of the Faerie Glow

**R:** Near/Far, **D:** Conc, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A Mushroom from a Faerie Ring (+1)

Causes even faintly perceptible tracks of a specific being to glow with a faint magic light, making them stand out when you are within 30 paces of them. The glow provides a bonus to Tracking rolls, which depends on the relationship between the target being tracked and the terrain. If the target is magically related to the terrain, +2; native to the terrain, +4; neutral to the terrain, +6; inimical to the terrain, +8. Tracking at night without a light source doubles the bonus. The more faint the tracks are, the more dimly they glow, so the storyguide may also modify the bonus based on the length of time since the target passed. You need something intimate to the target (an arcane connection) to trail it. The spell focus is scattered over the area where you expect to find tracks.

#### Level 30

##### Stone Tell of the Mind that Sits

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Conc, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** Dirt in Your Mouth (+3)

Allows you to talk with natural stone. A typical question and response takes one hour—stone speaks slowly. Though a stone is usually willing to talk, its direction sense and awareness of quickly moving things (such as people) are limited.

##### Sense the Feet that Tread the Earth

**R:** Touch, **D:** Conc, **T:** Bound, **Ritual**

You touch the earth and feel what is moving along the ground within the natural area where you stand. You can tell the direction, distance, weight, number, and manner of movement of moving things. For instance, you might sense "a single 50-stone creature slithering toward us, a hundred rods in that direction."

#### Level 40

##### Greeting the Maker

**R:** Touch, **D:** Conc, **T:** Small, **Ritual**

Gives you a vision of the maker of an item and the process (up to fifteen minutes worth) used to create the object. When used in conjunction with magical investigation in the lab, this provides a +5 to the Investigation roll, and, in any case, gives a hint about the nature of the item being studied.

## Muto Terram Guidelines

The targets below are for changing dirt. To change sand, mud, or clay, use the same level of magnitude as for dirt. To change stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To change metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude.

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

Level 3: Change the shape of dirt.

Level 4: Change one property of dirt.

Level 5: Change dirt to another type of natural earth (for example, sand to loam).

Level 10: Change dirt so that it is slightly unnatural (requisites may be required). Change dirt into a liquid or gas (with requisites). Change dirt to stone, or vice versa.

Level 15: Change dirt so that it is highly unnatural (requisites will often be required). Change dirt into a mixture of liquids, solids, and gases (with requisites).

Level 20: Change dirt into a slightly unnatural liquid or gas (with requisites).

### Muto Terram Spells

#### Level 3

##### Supple Iron and Rigid Rope

#### Level 5

##### Edge of the Razor

**R:** Touch, **D:** Sun/Perm, **T:** Small

Sharpens any metal edge to a degree unequaled by manual methods. An edged or pointed weapon gains a +2 bonus to Damage. Good-natured magi reward grogs by enchanting their weapons in this way.

#### Level 10

##### Object of Increased Size

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Sun/Perm, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Chunk of Masonry from a Castle (+1)

This spell enlarges an inanimate object originally no bigger than a large chest. The object doubles in each dimension and increases its weight eight times. The size increase is based on the object's original, natural size, so casting the spell more than once on an object has no effect. Noble elements like gold, silver, and gems, are not affected by this spell. If any part of the item resists growth, the item as a whole does not grow. Casting requisites are required for the appropriate Form for the target.

##### The Crystal Dart

**R:** Reach/Far, **D:** Mom, **T:** Small

**Aimed:** +4

**Spell Focus:** A Rock Crystal (+3)

**Requisite:** Rego

---

THE ART OF MAGIC

A 10-inch crystal dart rises from the ground at your feet, floats into the air, and speeds off like an arrow at a target that is within Far range. It does +10 damage.

### The Forgiving Earth

**R:** Near, **D:** Sun/Inst, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A Handful of Silt (+3)

Weakens earth in a 15-pace-by-15-pace area, making packed dirt as loose as plowed ground.

**R:** Near, **D:** Sun/Inst, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A Clod of Packed Earth (+3)

Makes the surface of the ground in a 15-pace-by-15-pace area become more solid. Mud becomes as soft earth, and soft earth becomes as packed dirt.

### Rock of Viscid Clay

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Sun/Inst, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A Bit of a Dwarven Pick (+5)

Softens rock enough that it may be dug out, molded, and otherwise manipulated in the same way that hard river clay can be. The rock is slightly sticky. The spell affects rock in a roughly spherical shape with a three-foot diameter.

### Earth that Breaks No More

**R:** Reach/Sight, **D:** Sun/Inst, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A Chunk of Stone (+1)

Turns a volume of packed dirt up to the size of a Room into stone.

### Statue to Animal

**R:** Reach, **D:** Sun/Perm, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

**Requisite:** Animál

Enchants a hand-sized earthen or stone statue of an animal. Later, anytime someone gives the command word (identified during the ritual), the statue turns into a life-sized specimen of the animal represented. The animal follows the orders of the person who gives the command word, and reverts to statue form when killed or when commanded to revert. If the animal is killed, the statue is no longer magical. One must touch the statue when giving the command word.

### Teeth of the Earth Mother

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Sun/Year, **T:** Spec

**Aimed:** -3/0

**Spell Focus:** The ivory tusk of a great elephant (+1)

**Requisite:** Rego

You cause twenty pointed pillars of white marble to spring up from the ground to a height of 12 feet, forming a circle 3 paces in diameter. At their tops, the pillars are thin and as sharp as spears. At the base, where they touch, they are 18 inches thick. When the pillars spring up, they can be used to cage people, to form a wall, or simply to skewer enemies. To skewer a target, you must make a targeting roll with a penalty of -3, but to capture a target you must make a standard targeting roll. Climbing to the top of the pillars requires three Climb stress rolls of 12+, and the tops break away when the target reaches them, causing the victim to fall. Skewering a target does +25 damage, possibly more on following rounds if the victim struggles or is exceptionally heavy. When the spell ends, the pillars crumble to dust.

## Perdo Terram Guidelines

To destroy sand, mud, or clay, use the same level of magnitude as for earth. To destroy stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To destroy metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude.

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Momentary (the damage remains), and basic target is Small.

Level 3: Destroy one property of dirt.

**Spell Focus:** A Handful of Rust (+1)

After the spell is cast, the metal of the target becomes so thoroughly rusted that it breaks if used in any demanding way (for example, used to strike a blow with in combat or to pry open a door). It also loses any sharpness it might once have had.

#### Pit of the Gaping Earth

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** Earth Taken from a Deep Cavern (+1)

The dirt in a circle 6 paces across recedes into the ground, leaving a pit 9 feet deep.

**Spell Focus:** 100-Year-Old Dust (+3)

Makes a cliff collapse, causing an avalanche. The effects depend on the size of the cliff and what lies below it.

## Rego Terram Guidelines

The guidelines for controlling dirt, sand, mud, or clay are listed below. To control stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To control metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude. Manipulating objects with great precision may also be higher, depending on the level of precision.

#### Ward Against Faeries of the Mountain

**R:** Spec, **D:** Ring/Perm, **T:** Circle

**Spell Focus:** A Star Ruby (+3)

As Ward Against Faeries of the Waters (ReAq Gen), but for faeries of earth and stone. At some angles at night, the ring may be seen as a dark brown dome.

#### Unseen Arm

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Conc, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** A Shaving of Silver (+1)

Slowly moves a light, nonliving thing, like a mug, instrument, or small pouch of coins; it cannot oppose intentional resistance. Magi use this spell to manipulate things at a distance, but the spell cannot be used to pull something from a person's hand or to move something that is held. The silver spell focus must have come from a valued serving platter. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for target are required.

#### Trackless Step

#### The Unseen Porter

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Silver Shaving (+1)

Like Unseen Arm (ReTe 5), but it can carry large objects such as crates. Roughly speaking, it has the capabilities of a very strong person (Str +5). The heavier the object is, the slower the unseen porter moves. If delicacy is required, high Finesse stress rolls (12+ or so) are needed. The spell can only carry inanimate objects, and cannot carry you. It also cannot lift things more than 6 feet above the ground. The focus must be from a valued serving platter. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for target are required.

#### The Earth's Carbuncle

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Spec

**Aimed:** +1

#### Hands of the Grasping Earth

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Sun, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A pair of brown gloves (+1)

**Requisite:** Muto

Earthen hands from beneath the target, rise out of the ground, and grasp the target's ankles. The target can avoid the hands on a Quickness stress roll of 12+. A roll of 9+ indicates that only one ankle is caught (the other hand disappears into the earth). To break free requires a Strength stress roll of 15+ if both ankles are caught, and a roll of 12+ if only one is caught. (One attempt is allowed per round, and each requires a Fatigue roll.) Each hand can be destroyed by beating its +25 Soak roll (hacking weapons do double normal damage). Each hand has one Body level.

#### Invisible Hand of the Thief

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** The Glove of a Convicted Thief (+3)

Takes an item weighing up to 3 pounds and teleports it instantly to a sack or pouch you are holding. The spell does not work if the item is worn, held, touched, or seen by anyone but you, or if it is a living thing. You must know exactly what and where the object is. Casting requisites: appropriate Form for the object stolen.

#### Crest of the Earth Wave

**R:** Far, **D:** Spec, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** A Vial of Water from a Tidal Wave (+5)

Creates a wave in the earth that starts at your feet and travels 100 paces in a designated direction. It starts as a narrow ripple and within 5 paces reaches its full size of 5 feet high and 30 paces wide. It moves about 50 paces per round. Those caught in its path must make Dexterity stress rolls of 9+ to leap over the wave, or they are tossed aside and take +10 Damage. The wave overturns trees and damages buildings in its path.

#### Earth Shock

**R:** Far, **D:** Mom, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** Lava from a Recent Volcano (+3)

Shakes the ground in a 100 pace radius. All affected by this spell must make a Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 10+ or fall. Apply these modifiers: standing still, +2; on solid stone, +2; moving slowly, +0; on earth, +0; running, –2; standing on a narrow bridge, –6.

#### The Earth Split Asunder

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Spec, **T:** Spec

**Aimed:** 0

**Spell Focus:** Earth from a Deep Cavern (+1)

Creates a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long, 10-foot-deep crack in the ground. It opens on one round, stays open for another round, and closes at the start of a third round, crushing all within it for +25 damage. You must maintain concentration for all three rounds, or the pit slowly closes, over an hour's time, rather than shutting quickly and violently. To avoid the pit, those in its vicinity other than the caster must make a Quickness stress roll of 9+. Falling in incurs +10 damage. To escape, another such roll is made. Unless outside help is provided, people in the pit only get one chance to escape.

#### Creeping Chasm

**R:** Far, **D:** Spec, **T:** Spec

**Aimed:** +6

**Spell Focus:** Earth from a Deep Cavern (+1)

Creates a chasm that runs from the ground in front of your feet towards some target within range that you designate. The chasm travels about 4 paces per round, growing slowly wider as it travels, reaching a maximum width of 20 feet at a distance of 30 paces. The chasm is 20 to 30 feet deep, and the sides are likely to collapse, so any caught in it are in a bit of a bind. To avoid the growing chasm, a target must make a Quickness stress roll of 9+. The chasm closes naturally in a week.

#### Hermes' Portal

**R:** Arc, **D:** Perm, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

Creates a magical portal through which people, animals, and objects can travel instantaneously. The ritual must be conducted simultaneously at two different locations, and after the ritual is performed, there is a magical connection between them. The magi conducting each ritual must have an arcane connection (such as a clod of dirt) to the other location when they are conducting the ritual. The portal is activated by some command word or ritual determined when the portal is enchanted. Inanimate things and unwilling creatures may be transmitted if someone else says the command word, and pushes the subject through.
