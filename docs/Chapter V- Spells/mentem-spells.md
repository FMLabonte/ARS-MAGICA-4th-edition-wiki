# Mentem Spells

Mentem spells govern thoughts, emotions, and memories. Intelligent minds are affected by Mentem spells, while the minds of beasts are affected only by Animal spells.

Normal people often have better than normal resistance against spells of the mind if they are especially dedicated, impassioned, or desperate. For instance, a parent defending home and family might get a +3 on rolls to withstand a malign spell, or get a resistance roll where one is not normally applicable. The storyguide should use his discretion to determine when to apply this rule.

Since the effects of Mentem spells are not usually visible, they give you a great deal of power when dealing with the common folk. Even spells requiring eye contact are relatively inconspicuous when cast without voice or gestures, but only powerful magi can cast spells this way in the Dominion.

## Creo Mentem Guidelines

In addition to healing minds, these spells can also create thoughts, emotions, and memories in another person's mind.

Typical sigils for Creo Mentem spells involve some small quirk in what is created. A specific idea may lie in the background of all memories created, for example.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Form words in another's mind.
**Level 10:** Put a thought into another's mind.
**Level 15:** Create an emotion in another's mind.
**Level 20:** Create a memory in another's mind.
**Level 25:** Effectively increase another person's ability to think.

### Creo Mentem Spells

#### General

##### Return of Mental Lucidity

**R:** Touch, **D:** Inst, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

Cancels the effects (short of death) of a malign Mentem spell if you can match or exceed the level of the spell with this ritual's level + a stress die.

#### Level 5

##### Words of the Unbroken Silence

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Clear Crystal (+2)

Lets you say two words directly to the mind of a target. The target can recognize your voice and knows that the message is of supernatural origin.

#### Level 15

##### Panic of the Trembling Heart

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Mouse (+1)

Creates an overpowering fear in one person of a specific object, person, or place.

##### Rising Ire

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Ruby (+3)

Makes the target furious at someone or something of your choice. A stress roll of 9+ using an appropriate Personality Trait (like Calm) can hold the anger in check, but it is felt strongly regardless of the roll. The ruby is associated with Mars and war.

#### Level 20

##### Memory of the Distant Dream

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Sprig of Rosemary (+1)

Inserts a full and complete memory into a person's mind. If the target gives the memory some thought and concentration, and makes an Intelligence roll of 9+, the memory is revealed as false. When cast with the spell focus of rosemary, which is commonly associated with good memory, the herb is crumbled, and then blown toward the victim.

##### Pains of the Perpetual Worry

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Moon/Season, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Onyx (+3)

Gives someone a nagging, taunting, painful emotion—a recurrent sense of anxiety, a fear of something he or she does not know, a fear of everything, and a fear of nothing. To have this spell cast on you is truly a curse. Onyx keeps sadness away from the wielder. By crushing it during the casting, you are able to sympathetically bring sadness to the target.

#### Level 25

##### Weight of a Thousand Hells

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Moon/Year, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Hand of Glory (+3)

Causes the victim to feel the despair, anguish, pain, and sorrow of a thousand sinners in Hell. This is a truly horrible spell, for the victim loses almost all motivation and earthly cares. All he can feel is his own pain—endless, inexorable, and searing. Appropriate Personality Trait rolls suffer a harmful adjustment of –5, and the target suffers –2 on any rolls that require thought or concentration. The target has a strong tendency to do nothing but brood. *A hand of glory is the hand of a recently dead convicted murderer and is a very powerful ingredient in many necromantic spells and diabolic summonings.*

##### Gift of Reason

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Sapphire (+1)

Gives the target the ability to reason clearly and understand ideas without the bias or distractions that normally interfere with thinking. A strong commitment to a cause, a strong personality, or a stubborn personality nullifies the effects of this spell. Even a relatively stupid person is able to understand difficult concepts under the influence of this spell. The sapphire used brings wisdom, and is often worn by nobles and rulers for exactly that reason.

## Intéllego Mentem Guidelines

These spells are superb for cutting through the confusion of social interaction and the endless banter of the rabble. The InAn spells that deal with the mind may also be used for ideas and guidelines for this section.

Sigils for InMe spells usually involve information being transmitted in unique ways.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Momentary, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Sense the state of consciousness of one intelligent being (for example, asleep, awake, meditating, dead, drugged, insane, or comatose).
**Level 10:** Sense a single emotion in a being.
**Level 15:** Sense all of the emotions in a being. Discover the truth of a statement.
**Level 20:** Speak with any one human. Read a person's surface thoughts. Pick a single answer from the mind of a target.
**Level 25:** Read the last day's memories from one person.
**Level 30:** Learn all the information you wish from a person's mind.

### Intéllego Mentem Spells

#### Level 10

##### Sight of the Transparent Motive

**R:** Eye/Near, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A clear crystal (+3)

Detects the general motive most powerfully influencing the target at the moment. General motives are such things as fear, anger, and greed, not specific things like the desire to look good before one's superiors.

#### Level 15

##### Perception of the Conflicting Motives

**R:** Eye/Near, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Sapphire (+3)

You can detect the conflicting motives behind one target's actions. Thus you might learn that a guard feels conflict between fear and duty. This spell is often used before application of a Muto spell, since it is usually easier to change a target's emotions after you've sensed them than it is to create emotions.

#### Level 20

##### Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** An Almond (+1)

**Requisite:** Auram

For as long as you maintain this spell, the target exhales a misty breath with each spoken lie. Small bits of ice form on the person's lips if the lie is particularly severe. In winter, when breath is visible anyway, lies produce a greater than normal amount of mist (the mist actually billows out). A target who makes a Communication + Guile stress roll of 15+ can determine whether any given statement will be taken by the spell as a lie. The spell can be defeated through extensive and judicious application of Creo Auram and Perdo Auram spells, and a demon is able to manipulate it in any way it wishes, as demons are the embodiment of deception and are never caught in a lie if they do not wish to be. If the spell focus of an almond is used, it must be crushed during the casting of the spell.

*House Quaesitor brought the Order this spell, and it is a very poor quaesitor who is without it.*

##### Posing the Silent Question

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Sapphire (+1)

You can ask one silent mental question of the target, then detect the answer. The truth of the answer is limited by the knowledge of the target. Questions to the effect of "What would you do if . . .?" often receive inaccurate replies. You are likely to get what the target thinks he would do, not necessarily what he would really do. The target of this spell does not notice the questioning unless he or she makes a magic resistance roll.

#### Level 25

##### Thoughts Within Babble

**R:** Per/Touch, **D:** Conc, **T:** Group

**Spell Focus:** A Quill (+3)

You can understand the speech of those within the target area, or any writing in any language, unless the speech or writing is coded. Perception or Communication stress rolls are needed for difficult exchanges.

#### Level 30

##### Peering into the Mortal Mind

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Sapphire (+1)

You can thoroughly probe and understand the contents of the mind of the target, including his or her immediate and long-term motives, personal strengths and weaknesses, and other pertinent information. The sapphire is said to bring wisdom. The target may resist this spell by making an Intelligence stress roll of 9+.

## Muto Mentem Guidelines

Since these spells literally change people's minds, they are quite powerful.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 4:** Force a ghost to become visible (provided that it can do so normally).
**Level 5:** Make a minor change in a person's memory of an event.
**Level 10:** Make a major change to a person's memory of an event. Make a minor change to a person's emotion.
**Level 15:** Make a major change to a person's memory of a series of events. Make a major change to a person's emotion.
**Level 20:** Make major changes to a person's memory of a period of his life. Completely change a person's emotions.
**Level 30:** Completely rewrite a person's memories. Utterly change a person's mind.

### Muto Mentem Spells

#### Level 5

##### Vision of the Haunting Spirit

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Group

**Spell Focus:** Green Turquoise (+5)

All spirits in the open and within the target area become visible (if they can do so normally). They can then turn invisible again but are likely to be interested in whoever has cast this spell on them.

*Green turquoise has associations with necromancy and other evil magics.*

*In Asaron of Flambeau's version of this spell, a small patch of the ghost's forehead, in the shape of a tongue of flame, remains invisible.*

#### Level 10

##### Subtle Shift of Heart

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Figure (+3)

Subtly change an emotion into a related but different one. For instance, loathing can become hate, and greed can become jealousy. The figure used must represent the spell's target.

#### Level 15

##### Enchantment of Detachment

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Figure (+3)

Calms and greatly lowers the intensity of the target's current emotions.

##### Emotion of Reversed Intentions

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Ruby (+3)

The main emotion influencing a character at the time of casting is replaced by its opposite over the next minute. The new emotion is felt as strongly as the original, but lacks justification and can therefore be talked out of someone. Intelligence stress roll of 9+ to resist.

#### Level 25

##### Recollection of Memories Never Quite Lived

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Inst, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Rosemary (+1)

Changes the target's memory of a detail into a similar, though different, memory. The target is no more sure of this manufactured memory than of the authentic one, so he may discover strange fabrications to be false.

#### Level 30

##### Mind of the Beast

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Topaz (+1)

**Requisite:** Animál

You turn the mind of the target into that of an animal of your choice. The victim acts and thinks like that animal as much as possible.

## Perdo Mentem Guidelines

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 5: Remove a minor detail from a person's memory.

Level 10: Remove an important detail from a person's memory.

Level 15: Quell an emotion in a person. Diminish a single mental capability in a person.

Level 20: Remove a minor or short memory from a person's mind.

Level 25: Remove a major or long memory from a person's mind. Reduce all of a person's mental capabilities.

Level 30: Remove all emotions from a person. Drive a person insane.

Level 40: Leaves a person a mindless husk.

### Perdo Mentem Spells

#### General

##### Lay to Rest the Haunting Spirit

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Inst, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Green Turquoise (+3)

Destroys a single, non-corporeal spirit if your roll of a stress die + spell level equals at least double the ghost's current Spirit Might. Philosophers concur that the spirit goes to the afterlife, or is perhaps weakened to helplessness, but is not actually destroyed. Souls, after all, are immortal.

#### Level 5

##### Tip of the Tongue

**R:** Reach/Sight, **D:** Diam/Sun, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Figure (+5)

Causes the target to forget one word of your choosing for the duration of the spell. The harder the target tries to remember the word, the harder it is to remember. The target can come up with the word without assistance by making an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 9+. If the target fails he may try again, but each additional roll adds +1 to the difficulty. The figure used in the spell must represent the person you are trying to affect.

#### Level 10

##### Loss of But a Moment's Memory

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Rosemary (+1)

**Requisite:** Intéllego

Removes up to five continuous minutes from a target's memory, leaving a blank. You target the loss of memory to a specific event or time. With an Intelligence stress roll of 9+, the target realizes that memories of a certain period are missing. This ease factor can change, depending on how important the missing memory is and what sort of circumstances surrounded the event. Careful introspection over a period of time restores the memory.

##### Trust of Childlike Faith

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Diam/Sun, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Lock of Child's Hair (+3)

The target loses judgment and believes almost any passable lie for the duration of the spell. An Intelligence stress roll of 6+ is allowed to resist. Truly incredible lies allow easier resistance rolls.

#### Level 15

##### Calm the Motion of the Heart

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Figure (+3)

Removes one emotion from the target until it appears again naturally. An angry person stops being angry, and a curious one stops being inquisitive. Many a magus finds this spell useful for keeping his apprentice's nose out of his immediate business.

#### Level 25

##### Blessing of Childlike Bliss

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Lock of a Child's Hair (+1)

Reduces an adult mind to a child's level. The target solves problems, reasons, and expresses emotions as would a three-year-old. Magi affected cannot cast spells. At first, anyway, the target is likely to be happy at having lost a world of cares and troubles that are no longer imaginable.

##### Passion's Lost Feeling

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Spec, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Figure (+3)

The target is unable to feel any sort of emotion and acts listlessly, without motivation or cares, until taking an hour's rest or meditation. An Intelligence + Stamina stress roll of 12+ is required to resist, and dire need allows additional Resistance rolls.

#### Level 35

##### Black Whisper

**R:** Touch, **D:** Moon/Perm, **T:** Ind

You whisper a magic sentence in the target's ear. It takes several seconds to speak the sentence, so an unwilling, able-bodied target can stop you. If you speak the whole sentence, the target must make a Stamina stress roll of 15+ or go completely insane. You need not use your hands for this spell, but you must be able to speak.

#### Level 70

##### Poisoning the Will

**R:** Sight, **D:** Moon/Perm, **T:** Bound, **Ritual**

You curse a place, be it a valley, town, city, or covenant. The curse gradually saps the will and vitality from the people there. They become less energetic, and slowly stop caring about the place, what happens there, other people, and finally themselves. Colors seem more drab and the days longer, and there is an all-pervading sense of boredom and lassitude. Strong-willed individuals and those with strong Personality Traits are less affected, but still suffer to an extent. All Personality Trait rolls while in the area suffer a –3 modifier. This spell affects only those who are within the cursed area, including visitors to it. Those who leave the area are overwhelmed by the return of their vigor and sense of purpose.

## Rego Mentem Guidelines

The Rego Animál spells that deal with the mind may also be used as good guidelines for levels of Rego Mentem spells.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 10: Control a target's mental state (for example, awake, asleep, or confused)

Level 15: Control a natural emotion (for example, calm, fear). The target must feel the emotion before you can control it.

Level 20: Control an unnatural emotion (for example, cultivate a person's feelings of bravery where he is usually cowardly).

Level 25: Control a human being as long as you can see him.

Level 30: Give a person one complex command, which he tries to carry out to the best of his ability.

Level 40: Completely control a person's mind and emotions.

### Rego Mentem Spells

#### General

##### Coerce the Spirits of the Night

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Green Turquoise (+3)

Makes a ghost obey you as long as you can coerce it with threats, such as a threat to defile its grave or to banish it to Hell. The more lurid and dramatic the threat, the more cooperative the ghost is. To affect a ghost, you must beat its current Spirit Might on a stress die + the level of the spell + Communication + Leadership. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty that depends on the potency of the threat.

##### Ring of Warding Against Spirits

**R:** Per, **D:** Ring/Perm, **T:** Circle

**Spell Focus:** A Green Turquoise (+3)

When the spell is cast, the storyguide rolls a simple die + the spell's level. Only ghosts with current Spirit Might higher than this total can enter the ring you create. At certain angles, the ring may be seen as an orange-hued dome.

#### Level 10

##### The Call to Slumber

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A pinch of sand (+1)

The target becomes sleepy and falls asleep within five minutes unless some current need makes wakefulness imperative. The target can resist with a stamina stress roll of 12+.

##### Snap of Awakening

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Twig (+1)

When you snap your fingers or break the spell focus, you instantly awaken the target from sleep to alert consciousness. Does not work on someone unconscious from Fatigue-level loss, wounds, or magic.

#### Level 15

##### Confusion of the Numbed Will

**R:** Eye/Sight, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Speck of Alcohol (+1)

Confuses a person, who must make an Intelligence stress roll to take any direct action. A roll of 12+ ends the spell, while a roll of 9+ lets the character take the intended action, but the spell remains in effect. Any lower roll means the character is confused and takes some other type of action. When it is imperative for the victim to take an action, the storyguide should allow an appropriate modifier to the roll. While under this spell, a character always strikes last in combat and gets at least a –1 on all attacking and defending rolls.

##### Scent of Peaceful Slumber

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Mom, **T:** Room

**Spell Focus:** A Lilac (+1)

**Requisite:** Auram

A very light purple haze that smells of lilacs slowly rises from the ground and remains for a few minutes. Those who breathe the haze and fail a Stamina stress roll of 9+ fall asleep. The haze first appears at about knee level. You must concentrate for two rounds in order for it to reach the height of a standing person's nose.

#### Level 20

##### Aura of Rightful Authority

**R:** Touch/Near, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Spec

**Spell Focus:** Violet Amethyst (+3)

Those who listen to the individual touched during the casting of this spell have their obedience and tendency to follow orders enhanced greatly. Common people generally do as they are told without question (as long as the orders are within the realm of reason). Those who are accustomed to giving orders themselves are much less likely to follow the target's. Bishops, dukes, generals, and magi are not affected by this spell unless it is cast on someone of status near to their own. Even then, such figures are allowed to attempt to make an Intelligence stress roll of 15+ to resist.

The violet amethyst is commonly made into a brooch or clasp. While casting the spell, usually you give it to the target of the spell to wear and make a shallow bow. Violet amethyst is the stone of Jupiter, and gives political power and ascendancy over the masses.

#### Level 25

##### Incantation of Summoning the Dead

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Black Onyx (+1)

Calls up a person's ghost. You must be on the spot where the person died, or must have the corpse. Alternatively, you can summon any ghost that haunts the area you are in, if you know the ghost's full name, according to the Law of Names. Those buried by Church ceremony and those have who gone straight to heaven (that is, saints and crusaders, as opposed to the normal folk who must wait for a time before going on) are not available for summoning.

#### Level 40

##### Enslave the Mortal Mind

**R:** Eye/Near, **D:** Sun/Moon, **T:** Ind

Enables you to completely control the loyalty, emotions, desires, interests, and long-term activities of any person. The target gets one chance to resist by making a Stamina + Intelligence stress roll of 12+. Further resistance rolls are possible when your control makes the victim do things strongly at odds with his or her former personality.

##### The Shrouded Glen

**R:** Per, **D:** Moon/Perm, **T:** Bound, **Ritual**

Enchants the Boundary in which the ritual is cast so that anyone moving towards it is subtly diverted, effectively keeping the place from being discovered accidentally. Anyone not actively searching for the hidden place never finds it. Those actively searching can find the place by making a Perception stress roll of 12+ (allowed once per day). Searchers get a +6 bonus for having an accurate map. If the surrounding terrain is more difficult to search than the average forest, the ease factor increases. Likewise, the ease factor drops if the terrain is more open than a forest, and completely open terrain is unsuitable for this spell. Once a searcher spots the hidden place, the spell does not prevent approach. Those who are present for the ritual are unaffected by the spell. This spell mimics the properties of many faerie forests.

#### Level 55

##### Exchange of the Two Minds

**R:** Touch, **D:** Year/Perm, **T:** Spec, **Ritual**

This spell switches the minds (but not the souls) of two creatures. A new body greatly confuses those who are unprepared for the shock, and even those who are ready take a day to adjust completely. Magi who transport their own minds into younger, healthier bodies usually find that having a strong body entails having powerful passions that interfere with the clear thinking needed to pursue the magical Arts.

Both people involved must make a Stamina stress roll of 3+, rolled before the switch is made, to survive the transfer.
