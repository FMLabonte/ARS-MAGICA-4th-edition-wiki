# Aquam Spells

Aquam spells affect water and all other liquids. They cannot affect liquids in a body, such as blood; that requires a Corpus spell.

## Creo Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Sun (and boosted duration is usually Instant). Basic target is Small.

Water created without raw vis quenches the thirst but provides no lasting benefits to the drinker. Common sigils for Creo Aquam spells include water with a specific scent, color, or flavor.

**General:** Create poison that does +(Level) damage (Corpus or Animal requisite). Create a liquid that does +(Level – 5) damage on contact (Corpus or Animal requisite).

**Level 5:** Fill a man-made container with water (or some other natural liquid, with appropriate requisites).

**Level 10:** Create water (or some other natural liquid) that is not contained (for example, spread over a surface). Create a slightly unnatural liquid.

**Level 15:** Create water (or some other natural liquid) in an unnatural shape (for example, in a sphere over someone's head) or in an unnatural location (like within someone's lungs)—but water so created will behave normally. Create an extremely unnatural liquid.

**Level 20:** Create poison that causes a minor illness.

**Level 25:** Create a small spring. Create poison that causes major illness.

**Level 30:** Create poison that is fatal.

## Creo Aquam Spells

### Level 15

#### Creeping Oil
R: Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Requisite: Ignem

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Lantern Oil (+3)

Saturates a porous material with flammable oil. When casting this spell, you make a flicking motion with your index finger and thumb, as if propelling something at the target. A dot of oil appears on the target after the spell is finished, and slowly spreads over the target, saturating enough cloth to cover a person. If used on a person's clothes and ignited, the oil does +12 damage the first round, +6 the second, and +0 the third.

#### Footsteps of Slippery Oil
R: Personal/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Snake Fat (+1)

From each of the next ten footsteps the target of this spell takes, nonflammable grease spreads out, leaving a slick area 10 paces wide. Dexterity stress rolls are required to remain upright whenever a character on the oil does something more challenging than walking. A roll of 6+ is needed for the average maneuver, with rolls of up to 15+ needed to (for example) make a right turn at full speed on a smooth, greased surface. Using fat from a snake makes casting slightly easier.

This spell was invented by a rather good-natured magus, and the gestures associated with the most common variations of the spell are as comical as the effects themselves. You can stand first on one leg, and then the other, vigorously rubbing the bottom of each upturned foot, as if spreading on a salve.

#### Lungs of Water and Death
R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Black Onyx (+1)

Fills a target's lungs with water. The target falls to the ground and can do nothing but cough up water. A Stamina stress roll of 6+ averts drowning, but the target is still incapacitated for at least three minutes as he clears the water from his lungs. Casting requisite is Animál for beasts and Corpus for people. Black onyx, which may be used with this spell, is known to be associated with both malediction and death.

#### Mighty Torrent of Water
R: Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Aimed (-3 to +1)

Spell Focus: An Aquamarine Stone (+3)

A 3-foot-diameter cone of water sprays from your outstretched arms towards your target. During these rounds, you must maintain concentration. Anyone hit by this gusher of water takes +10 damage and must make a Strength + Size stress roll of 9+ or be sent flying back. Targeting is at -3 for the first round, increasing by +1 for every round it is aimed at the same target thereafter. The aquamarine stone aids the spell due to its strong ties to the element of water.

Marbaid of Flambeau's wizard's sigil is connected to his obsession with blood. In his version of the spell, which has a Corpus requisite, the target is hit by a gush of blood, and the stains do not go away until Sunrise/Sunset.

### Level 30

#### Breaking the Perpetual Drought
R: Per, D: Sun, T: Bound, Ritual

Brings normal rainfall to the region suffering from drought.

### Level 40

#### Deluge of Rushing and Dashing
R: Near, D: Conc, T: Bound, Ritual

Spell Focus: A Drop of Water from a Water Elemental (+4)

Causes a stream to flood, starting at the stream's nearest point to you and continuing to 1 mile downstream. If the spell focus is present, it is flicked into the stream, and the flood begins at that precise point. The results of this spell are generally quite impressive. As the river overflows its original bed, it becomes a raging torrent, sucking in everything near it. Damage from the spell can last for many years.

As long as you concentrate, the stream remains at flood levels. Anyone caught near the stream when it floods is struck by the rush of water (+10 damage), caught up in the flood, and dragged along. Every round, a victim makes a Strength + Swim stress roll. A roll of 9+ means the character escapes the flood. Otherwise, the character loses one Fatigue level and takes a +5 damage. Any who fall unconscious drown. This roll is repeated until the character either escapes the flood or dies.

## Intéllego Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small. Note that Intéllego Aquam spells do not normally require requisites for other liquids.

Most sigils manifest in Intéllego Aquam spells by causing the information to be reported in some slightly quirky way. For example, Chavin of Tytalus's version of Voice of the Lake always makes the lake sound strong, masculine, and arrogant.

**Level 1:** Get an image of water within range.

**Level 3:** Get an images of water and its immediate surroundings within range.

**Level 5:** Learn the natural properties of a liquid.

**Level 10:** Learn the natural properties of a mixture of liquids.

**Level 15:** Learn the magical properties of a liquid. Make your senses unaffected by water.

**Level 20:** Learn the magical properties of a mixture of liquids.

**Level 25:** Speak with a natural body of water.

**Level 30:** Speak with an artificial body of water (like a fountain).

## Intéllego Aquam Spells

### Level 5

#### Subtle Taste of Poison and Purity
R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+5)

Determines all the mundane properties of a liquid that you touch with your tongue. The sapphire, which may be used with this spell, provides wisdom.

#### Touch of the Pearls
R: Touch/Reach, D: Conc/Moon, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Pearl (+5)

Tells you whether a liquid you hold or touch is poisonous, just as a pearl sometimes does. Not surprisingly, having a pearl present makes it very hard to fail when casting this spell.

In Verdan of Ex Miscellanea's version of the spell, poisonous liquids turn a faint green. According to his sigil, all his spells involve the color green. Many of his spell variants have Imáginem or Muto requisites.

### Level 15

#### Call of the Rushing Waters
R: Arc, D: Conc/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Divining Rod Made of Hazel (+1)

Allows you to find any natural body of water for which you have an arcane connection (for example, a vial of water from it). Once you cast the spell, you can hear the water while you concentrate. Following the sound eventually brings you to the water, but you must make simple Perception rolls of 6+ to follow the sound accurately (roll once per day for long journeys). If you break concentration, you must cast the spell again (unless it is boosted). A body of water that does not move or that makes little noise requires a roll of 9+ to be traced. If you construct a Y-shaped rod out of hazel wood, you get a bonus not only to the casting roll, but to Perception rolls as well.

### Level 25

#### Voice of the Lake
R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Rock from the Lake Bottom (+3)

You can hold a conversation with a body of water. A body of water usually knows about things directly in contact with it, such as boats and fish. By the Law of Contagion, any item from the body connects you to the body.

### Level 30

#### Enchantment of the Scrying Pool
R: Spec, D: Year, T: Spec, Ritual

Requisite: Imáginem

Turns a body of water into a scrying pool. Innately magical people (including most companions with mystical powers) who look into the pool can see any spot they know of that is within sight of some natural body of water. The view you get is the same view that someone would have from a low boat on the water—either close to shore or far from shore, as desired. Maximum range is 500 miles. This ritual is not entirely of Hermetic magic (and does not conform to the normal InAq guidelines). It is an old Mercurian ritual that has become known throughout the Order.

## Muto Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

Some Muto Aquam spells involve heat and cold, but are not Ignem spells. The distinction is that an Ignem spell uses heat as an intermediary to effect a change, while a Muto Aquam spell effects the change directly. For example, you can turn ice into steam by applying heat with an Ignem spell, but you can probably make the change faster by using a Muto Aquam spell, making the change directly.

You cannot transform liquids within someone's body unless the spell is designed that way (and has a Corpus or Animál requisite).

The guidelines given are for turning water into another liquid, or into ice, or, in general, into another thing that is still based on the Aquam Form. To cause a liquid to change into something that is not governed by Aquam takes one more level of magnitude, in general.

**General:** Change a liquid into a poison doing +(Level + 5) points of damage (Corpus or Animál requisite). Change a liquid into a liquid that does +(Level) points of damage on contact (Corpus or Animál requisite).

**Level 3:** Change a characteristic of liquid within that liquid's normal range (for example, make water pure or stagnant).

**Level 4:** Change a natural liquid into another natural liquid.

**Level 5:** Change a liquid into a corresponding solid (Terram requisite) or gas (Auram requisite) (for example, water to ice or steam). Change a natural liquid into a slightly unnatural liquid (for example, make blue water or strawberry flavored castor oil), or vice versa.

**Level 10:** Change a liquid into an unrelated solid or gas (with requisites). Change a natural liquid into two or more different natural liquids, with the two types separate (although they will mix again normally). Change a liquid into a very unnatural liquid (for example, a shocking pink liquid that causes bizarre hallucinations)—requisites will often be required.

**Level 15:** Change a liquid into a mixture of any liquid, solid (with Terram requisite), or gas (with Auram requisite). Change a liquid into a slightly unnatural solid or gas.

**Level 20:** Change a liquid into a very unnatural solid or gas.

## Muto Aquam Spells

### Level 10

#### Lungs of the Fish
R: Personal/Touch, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Powdered Scales of a Fish (+3)

Requisites: Auram

Turns water into air as it enters your lungs, allowing you to breathe water as you do air. If using the spell focus, place a small bit of it on your tongue, and swallow it at the completion of the spell.

### Level 15

#### Incantation of Putrid Wine
R: Reach/Far, D: Sun/Inst, T: Room

Spell Focus: Venom from a Spider (+1)

Makes all liquids within the target room vile, malodorous, and mildly poisonous (+5 damage). The room where this spell is cast may not lose the stench for weeks or months.

#### Breath of Winter
R: Touch/Sight, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Beryl (+5)

Requisite: Terram

Turns a circle of water up to 5 paces across into snow. Beryl is a gem associated with water.

### Level 20

### Level 25

#### Ice of Drowning
R: Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Piece of Ice from a Frozen Ocean (+3)

Requisites: Terram, Rego

Fills water in a circle 10 paces across with large, jagged chunks of ice that pound against anything on the water's surface. The ice can punch holes in small boats but does not damage ships. Any swimmers in the area take +15 damage, and suffer -6 and two extra botch checks on Swim rolls. If a piece of ice from waters north of England is available, it is thrown into the water where the spell is cast.

### Level 30

#### Bridge of Frost
R: Near, D: Sun, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Beryl (+3)

Requisite: Terram

Causes a thick layer of frost (firm enough to walk on) to form on the surface of a body of water. The frost can take any shape up to 15 paces in any direction. The bridge collapses after 6 to 15 creatures have crossed over it (roll a simple die +5). Only the storyguide knows the number of creatures that can cross.

In Cralian of Tremere's version of this spell, the frost is so crystal clear that it can hardly be seen. All of his spells are very subtle.

### Level 55

#### Vile Water of Sterility
R: Touch, D: Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Spell Focus: Venom from a Dragon (+5)

Ruins a body of water up to the size of a small lake, making it unfit for natural habitation and consumption. The water becomes dark and murky, and noxious fumes emanate from it. Vegetation on the banks either dies or becomes corrupt. Nearby trees become gnarled and blackened, and land animals flee the area. If the venom from a dragon is available, a drop is let into the lake. The corruption begins there, and is always strongest at that spot.

## Perdo Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Instant, and basic target is Small.

As magnitudes in these spells rise, the destruction caused becomes more subtle, or more pervasive. Sigils commonly seen in Perdo Aquam spells usually involve destruction in some specific way.

**Level 5:** Destroy a liquid (requisites may be required).

**Level 15:** Destroy one property of a liquid (like alcohol's ability to intoxicate or sea water's saltiness).

**Level 20:** Destroy a Small spring, so that it never flows again.

**Level 40:** Destroy a lake, drying the bed and preventing water from ever naturally pooling there (channels for runoff are also created)—Ritual.

## Perdo Aquam Spells

### Level 10

#### Parching Wind
R: Reach/Near, D: Inst, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Dust (+1)

Removes all water from any inanimate object of Size -1 or less, including plants (with a Herbam requisite), possibly making the object brittle and fragile. A pinch of dust can be tossed at the target, driving water from it.

### Level 20

#### Curse of the Desert
R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Breeze from a Desert (+3)

Removes most of the fluid from the target's body, doing +15 damage, which can only be Soaked with Stamina + Size. The target must drink within an hour of being struck with this spell, or it dies. Casting requisites are Animál for beasts, and Corpus for humans. If you have managed to trap a breeze from a desert, you open the container in which it is carried while casting the spell; the breeze will blow towards the victim, draining him or her of fluid.

### Level 35

#### Calling the Odious Drought
R: Touch, D: Year/Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Causes a drought over the surrounding area. Only one-tenth the normal rain falls, streams dry up, and rivers dwindle. The area of effect may be increased by half a mile for each extra pawn of vis used.

## Rego Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small.

**General:** Ward against Faerie creatures of water whose might is less than or equal to the level of the spell (duration Ring, target Group).

**Level 5:** Control a liquid in a natural fashion (for example, control direction or speed of flow).

**Level 10:** Control a liquid in a slightly unnatural fashion (for example, make it flow uphill or stop it from wetting something). Control an amount of liquid which is part of a larger body in a natural fashion.

**Level 15:** Control a liquid in a highly unnatural fashion (for example, make it flow straight up in the air or take on a humanoid form). Control an amount of liquid which is part of a larger body in a slightly unnatural fashion.

**Level 20:** Control an amount of liquid which is part of a larger body in a highly unnatural fashion.

## Rego Aquam Spells

### General

#### Ward Against Faeries of the Waters
R: Near, D: Ring/Perm, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

No water faerie whose Faerie Might is equal to or less than the level of the spell can affect those targeted by the spell. Faeries cannot directly or indirectly break the magic circle, nor can they use ranged attacks or magic to affect those within it.

The star ruby is a rare gem that aids in controlling many types of entities. Seen from certain angles at night, the ring appears as a light blue dome.

### Level 5

#### Cloak of the Duck's Feathers
R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Duck's Feather (+3)

Makes water run off one object or creature, protecting the target and the target's apparel from dampness. The spell is broken if the target is submerged in water.

### Level 10

#### Break the Oncoming Wave
R: Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Aquamarine Gem (+3)

Breaks all waves and torrents of water (including magical ones) as they come within 10 paces of you. The water either crashes to the ground or flows around you in a truly impressive display. The aquamarine gem has strong associations with water.

In Ferramentum of Verditius's version of this spell, the water breaks at precisely 10 paces, leaving a very clean line showing where the waves stopped. All of his spells may be recognized by their orderliness.

### Level 15

#### Gift of the Floating Wood
R: Near/Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Piece of Wood (+3)

Lets any object or creature of Size +3 or smaller float in water.

#### Push of the Gentle Wave
R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Sliver from an Oar (+3)

A low wave is formed to propel a small boat slowly through the water. When casting this spell, you commonly make a pushing gesture. If a sliver from an oar is available, you throw it into the water behind the boat, and the wave originates from that spot.

In Silva of Merinita's version of this spell, the wave occasionally drifts or bobs about, as if it is happy and playful.

### Level 20

#### Chaos of the Angry Waves
R: Far, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: An Emerald (+3)

Causes water to churn wildly, overturning small water craft and forcing Swim rolls at -6, in a circular area 20 paces across. The emerald has associations with water.

### Level 30

#### Parting the Waves
R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Bound

Spell Focus: A Vial of Water from the Sea (+1)

Parts a body of water, revealing a dry path 5 paces wide along the bottom.

#### Pull of the Watery Grave
R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Piece of a Boat Long Buried Below the Waves (+3)

<!-- End of page-112-116.md -->


<!-- Start of page-117-121.md -->

### Pull of the Watery Grave
R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Piece of a Boat Long Buried Below the Waves (+3)

Creates a strong undertow that pulls any object smaller than a rowboat 25 fathoms (150 feet) into the depths. Each of those caught in the undercurrent must make 9+ on a Strength + Swim stress roll to avoid being dragged down. A roll is made each round that the spell is maintained.

#### Tower of Whirling Water
R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Beryl (+1)

From a large body of water you form a waterspout that moves under your mental direction. It causes a simple die + 15 damage to anyone it hits (no Attack roll necessary). In addition, those struck must make a Quickness stress roll of 6+ to avoid being sucked up by the waterspout. Those who fail are helplessly pulled into the spout and begin to drown immediately. When the waterspout fails, they fall up to 20 feet to the water's surface. If you direct the waterspout to move across land, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 9+ each round to maintain it.

#### Waves of Drowning and Smashing
R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Vial of Water (see below) (+3)

Raises a wave 5 feet high and 30 paces wide, which can submerge swimmers, overturn rowboats, and damage sailing ships. It starts as a small, curved wave and grows for the first 10 paces, at which point it reaches maximum size. If it travels 100 paces without striking an object large enough to break it up, it dissipates. The vial of water must have been taken from a large body of water during a storm.

### Level 60

#### Neptune's Wrath
R: Sight, D: Spec, T: Spec, Ritual

A gigantic wave is created in a very large body of water. The wave, which is only 20 feet high but up to a mile wide, is capable of capsizing ships at sea, smashing and drowning people near shore, and utterly destroying coastline communities. The tidal wave needs 5 miles of water surface to build itself up to proper proportions. The magus cannot control the wave without casting another spell.
