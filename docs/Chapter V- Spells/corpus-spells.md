# Corpus Spells

Corpus spells deal with human or humanlike bodies and anything that involves those bodies. Most faeries have enough in common with humans to be affected by Corpus spells.

In previous editions of Ars Magica, "Corpus" was called "Córporem," but that is the wrong form of the Latin noun. When you encounter spells from earlier Ars Magica products, treat Córporem as Corpus.

## Creo Corpus Guidelines

Many Creo Corpus spells are most useful as permanent spells, which require raw vis. A spell that binds your wounds lets your wounds open again by the next sunrise or sunset if it is cast without raw vis; only with raw vis can permanent healing be effected. Unless otherwise noted, a healing spell cast without raw vis actually suspends the healing process so that upon the spell's expiration, wounds are as fresh as they were when the spell was cast. No Hermetic spell can restore Fatigue levels.

Creo Animál spells may be used as guidelines and examples for Creo Corpus spells. Note that creation of body parts and corpses is usually one level of magnitude higher than corresponding CrAn spells, because of the complexity of the human body.

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Prevent decay of a body.

**Level 10:** Create an entire human corpse. Stabilize one wound.

**Level 15:** Stop the progress of a disease.

**Level 20:** Heal one Body level of damage.

**Level 25:** Heal the damage caused by a poison or disease.

**Level 30:** Restore a lost limb. Heal two Body levels of damage.

**Level 35:** Heal four Body levels of damage.

**Level 40:** Heal all harm done to a body.

**Level 50:** Return "life" to a corpse (Ritual)—See The Shadow of Life Renewed.

## Creo Corpus Spells

### General

#### Free the Accursed Body

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind, Ritual

Cancels or reverses the effects (other than death) of a malign Corpus spell, such as Twist of the Tongue (PeCo 30), if you can match or exceed the level of the spell with the level of this ritual.

### Level 10

#### Bind Wound

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Spider's Web (+3)

Typically, you place your hands on the target and pass them over the wound, which magically seals itself and stops bleeding. If a spider's web is available, it is laid over the wound and disappears as the wound seals itself. Any subsequent recovery rolls necessitated by the wound are made at +1.

#### Charm Against Putrefaction

R: Touch/Near, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Piece of Preserved Flesh (+3)

Prevents decay of a human corpse, or of a severed body part. Necromancers use it to preserve their revived corpses.

### Level 15

#### Gentle Touch of the Purified Body

R: Touch, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Pouch of Healing Herbs (+3)

Stops the progress of any disease of typical strength. It does not remove damage that has already occurred, nor does it cure such dread illnesses as leprosy.

### Level 20

#### The Chirurgeon's Healing Touch

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Bloodstone (+3)

The person touched can recover a lost Body level by making a Stamina stress roll of 3+, to which is added the highest Chirurgy skill of anyone who has successfully tended the wounds. Also, subtract the wound penalty from the roll. Does not heal damage from poison or disease.

### Level 25

#### Restoration of the Defiled Body

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Garnet (+1)

Removes the crippling or malignant effects of any poison, of any disease, or of premature aging. The effects of natural aging cannot be undone by this or any spell. Garnet is reputed to help against diseases and other afflictions.

### Level 30

#### The Severed Limb Made Whole

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Carnelian (+1)

A limb that has been detached from the body can be reattached, but any decay that has occurred on the severed limb remains after the limb is reattached. After a day of decomposition, a limb is weak. After seven days, it is nearly useless and infects the character on whom it is replaced (Stamina stress roll of 6+ or lose a Body level). If it's been severed for more than two weeks, the limb is completely useless.

### Level 40

#### Incantation of the Body Made Whole

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Chips from a Unicorn's Hooves (+3)

Heals all damage to a human body at the rate of one Body level per round. You must maintain concentration for the rounds during which the spell is cast. A cloak, blanket, or similar covering must be laid over the target to cast the spell.

### Level 50

#### Healer's Ring

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Circle, Ritual

Every round, every person in the ring makes a Stamina stress roll of 3+ to regain a Body level. If a botch is rolled, a Body level is lost. Useful for pitched battles, during covenant defense, and during especially disastrous adventures, although the vis cost is quite high. The ring lasts until the next sunrise or sunset. Wounds healed remain healed with duration Sun as well, unless raw vis is used to extend the duration to Instant.

### Level 75

#### The Shadow of Life Renewed

R: Reach, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Requisites: Mentem

Brings the semblance of life to a corpse. During the ritual, healing spells work on the corpse, which is important because the body must be physically whole or else it simply dies again once it is brought back to life. For each day that the person has been dead, roll for aging. When the ritual is complete, roll a die to determine the success of the attempt: 1—body dissolves; 2—body possessed by a demon, faerie, or other supernatural entity; 3—mindless, useless living corpse; 4 or 5—automaton with no Abilities over 3; 6 or 7—automaton, but Abilities as a normal person's; 8—person with self direction but no personality, and somehow dangerously demented; 9 or 10—person with will, but no personality. In any case, the revived person is not truly alive and is unable to gain experience points. Also, the person must make an aging roll at the beginning of each year of its existence, regardless of age. This is the closest that the Order has gotten to raising a person from the dead.

## Intéllego Corpus Guidelines

Common sigils seen in Intéllego Corpus spells usually report information in some strange or quirky way.

Basic range is Sight, basic duration is Momentary, and basic target is Individual

**Level 5:** Sense very general information about a body.

**Level 10:** Sense a specific piece of information about a body.

**Level 15:** Locate a person you have an arcane connection to.

**Level 20:** Sense all useful information about a body.

**Level 25:** Speak with a dead body.

## Intéllego Corpus Spells

### General

#### Sight of the True Form

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Four-Leaf Clover (+3)

You see the true, original form of any person whose form has been changed or masked. This spell can see through mundane masks and disguises at level 10, and can see through the effects of other spells that are equal to or lower than the level of this spell. A four-leaf clover is said to aid its bearer in seeing through deceptions.

### Level 5

#### Physician's Eye

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Garnet (+1)

Determines the general health of a single person. Specific afflictions appear to you as areas of yellow coloration on the person's body. A Perception + Medicine stress roll is required to identify unusual diseases. The ease factor is determined by the rarity of the disease.

### Level 10

#### Revealed Flaws of Mortal Flesh

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+5)

You are able to find any medical defects in a person or being that you are looking at. You must possess an arcane connection to the person or being. The sapphire used with this spell is said to provide wisdom.

### Level 15

#### Whispers Through the Black Gate

R: Reach/Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

Requisites: Mentem

You can speak through the barrier—the figurative "gate"—that stands between the dead and the living, to one corpse that has not yet decayed into a skeleton. The corpse cannot have been buried in Church burial, nor have belonged to a spirit that went straight to Heaven (for example, a saint or a crusader). The spirit that you speak with is not compelled to tell the truth; you can, of course, find ways to coerce or trick it into doing so. All those around you can hear the voice of the corpse. Green turquoise is heavily associated with necromancy; peasants tend to shy away from one with such an "evil" stone.

### Level 20

#### The Inexorable Search

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Feather from the Target's Pillow (+4)

Determines the location of a specific person. To cast the spell you need a map and an arcane connection. After casting the spell, you can move your finger over the map at the rate of one hour per square foot of map. When your finger passes over the person's location as represented on the map, you sense the person's presence. (If the person is not in the area covered by the map, no sensations result.) You can locate the person to within a thumb's width on the map. Thus, a map with a larger scale gives more-precise information. Each casting of the spell allows for the searching of one map. A similar spell allows you to search for a dead body (Tracing the Trail of Death's Stench).

### Level 30

#### The Eye of the Sage

R: Arc, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Griffin's Eye (+3)

Requisites: Imaginem

Lets you see a specific person and what is within one pace of that person. The image is clear enough to allow reading. The vision lasts for an hour or until concentration is broken. At distances over 100 miles, the image grows cloudy and becomes obscured. Each pawn of vis expended in casting can extend this limit by 50 miles.

## Muto Corpus Guidelines

These spells transform people. There are beneficial spells to cast on yourself and your compatriots, and harmful spells to cast on your foes.

Transformations do not usually completely eradicate the original form; something of the original remains. If you turn a fat, one-armed man into a wolf, the wolf is fat, three-legged, and male.

Transformations can have subtle (or sometimes dramatic) permanent effects. Someone who spends a month or more as an animal begins to act and think like that animal. Eventually, weak-willed individuals might lose their human identity altogether. When transformed back into a human, the target might temporarily or permanently retain some feature of the other shape. Someone turned into a rabbit and back might keep a fondness for carrots or retain unnaturally big ears. Transformations are tricky things.

Muto Corpus spells cannot alter a person's mind, so they leave the transformed person's intelligence and knowledge intact. Magi can cast spells while in animal form, but they suffer the normal –15 penalty for casting without hands or voice. The transformed person gains any abilities the animal form has though it may take a day or so of experience to get used to using them.

To change accouterments along with the body involves requisites. For example, you need a casting requisite of Animal for leather worn, Aquam for any liquids carried, and Terram for metal objects worn (including studs in armor). Accouterments are transformed only if they are actually being worn, not if they are just being carried in the hand. Simply put, equipment will not be transformed for one of two reasons: either because you choose not to use the casting requisites or because the storyguide rules that the equipment is not sufficiently part of the target's worn equipment. This untransformed equipment falls to the ground.

When you are under the influence of one of your own shapechanging spells, you may change yourself back by concentrating, but doing so ends the spell.

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Change a small part of a person (for example, an eye or nose).

**Level 10:** Change a limb of a person.

**Level 15:** Change the face of a person.

**Level 20:** Utterly change the appearance or size of a person (though they must still remain human in form). Make a body resistant to damage (+5 Soak).

**Level 25:** Turn a human into a land animal (with an Animál requisite).

**Level 30:** Make body resistant to damage (+10 Soak).

**Level 35:** Turn a human into a bird or a fish (Animál requisite).

**Level 40:** Turn a human into a solid inanimate object (Terram requisite). Turn a human into a plant (Herbam requisite).

**Level 45:** Turn a human into an insubstantial object (Auram requisite).

## Muto Corpus Spells

### Level 5

#### Evil Eye

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Oversized Eyeball (+3)

Enlarges an eye of the target, deforming the face and producing a grisly image.

#### Eyes of the Cat

R: Touch, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Hair from a Cat (+3)

Requisites: Animál

The target gains the eyes of a cat, which allow him or her to see in near darkness (but not in absolute darkness, such as a lightless subterranean cavern).

### Level 15

#### Disguise of the New Visage

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Chip from a Pooka's Hoof (+5)

The target's facial features are transformed to any approximately human configuration you choose.

In Cralian of Tremere's version of this spell, the new visage is always as unassuming as possible.

### Level 20

#### Arm of the Infant

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Lock of Hair from a Baby (+1)

Shrinks a person's arm to half its original length and makes it pudgy, like an infant's.

#### Preternatural Growth and Shrinking

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Giant's Heart (+5)

Adds +1 to your normal Size or decreases it by up to 2 points. An extra Size point bestowed by this spell gives +1 Soak, +1 Strength, an extra Body level, and -1 Defense. Each point lost has the reverse effects.

### Level 25

#### Gift of the Bear's Fortitude

R: Personal/Touch, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Heart of a Black Faerie Bear (+3)

Requisite: Animál

Your flesh becomes resistant to physical damage. You get +10 to your Soak. If the duration is "Year" and you suffer a Soak botch, your resistance comes back after the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. Your flesh is tough and insensitive; any rolls that involve a sensitive touch (such as for picking a lock) are at -3.

#### Shape of the Woodland Prowler

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Wolf's Tooth (+3)

Requisite: Animál

You place a wolf skin over yourself or another, and the target changes into a wolf. The target may change back at will, ending the spell. Before casting this spell, you must first, of course, acquire the skin of a wolf.

### Level 30

#### Cloak of Black Feathers

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Cape of Black Feathers (+0)

Requisites: Animál, Auram

You hang a small cape of raven feathers on your back (or on someone else's, if you use vis) and the target transforms into a raven. The target can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell.

### Level 35

#### Curse of Circe

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Mandrake (+3)

Requisite: Animál

Turns a person into a pig. Mandrake, which is also known as "Circe's Plant," can be found in faerie forests and at places where a human life has been taken. The target may resist this affect by making a Stamina stress roll of 9+.

#### Stance of the Patient Tree

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Tree Branch (+3)

Requisite: Herbam

You turn yourself (or another, if you use vis) into a tree about 12 feet high, with a trunk about a foot thick. The target can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a tree. The target can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While in tree form, the target does not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The tree branch you use determines the kind of tree the target becomes.

### Level 40

#### Cloak of Mist

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Powdered Agate (+1)

Requisites: Auram, Aquam

You turn yourself (or another, if you use vis) into a thick, cohesive mist of approximately human size. You can float through the air at walking speed and can see and hear what is going on around you. You can also seep through cracks, but cannot move through solid objects. You return to human form at any time, but doing so ends the spell. As mist, you are subject to the forces of the wind. If an agate is used, you throw it over yourself or another, and as it falls, the target fades to mist.

#### Transform to Water

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Water Just Melted from Ice (+3)

Requisite: Aquam

You turn yourself (or another, if you use vis) into water, one pint for every pound of the target's weight. As water, you can hold yourself together unless someone makes an effort to separate part of you from the rest. You can roll slowly across the ground, but cannot move uphill. You can hear sounds, feel things that touch you, and can sense temperature. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. You cannot resume human form if a significant part of your body/water is separated from the rest.

### Level 45

#### The Silent Vigil

R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Essence of an Earth Elemental (+3)

Requisite: Terram

You can move into and become part of a rock formation that is at least twice your size. While in the stone, you can hear what is going on around you, but you cannot use other senses. The spell lasts until you come out, and you must come out where you went in. You have no need for food or drink, though you do age. Rolls to recover from Fatigue or wounds take twice as long to make while you are in the stone. Casting requisites are required for items you take with you into the stone.

### Level 50

#### Mists of Change

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Spec, Ritual

Requisites: Animál, Auram

As this spell is cast, a whipping wind arises and patches of mist begin to roll across the landscape. Sometimes, a patch of mist suddenly envelops a person for a few seconds, during which time the victim cannot move. When the mist blows away, continuing its course, the person is left transformed into a random creature. Roll a simple die to determine the result: 1—Wolf, 2—Horse, 3—Brown Bear, 4—Large Toad, 5—Ferret, 6—Viper, 7—Boar/Sow, 8—Dog, 9—Cat, or 0—Other (storyguide picks; be cruel). People transformed retain their human minds, but inherit all the passions and instincts of their new forms.

The mist covers an area within a 1-mile radius, the center of which must be in sight when you cast the spell. The mists affect the area for an hour. Generally, the mists affect one in ten of the people caught in the radius. To see whether a given person falls victim, make a simple roll. A zero indicates the spell affects the person.

## Perdo Corpus Guidelines

These spells harm people directly, often permanently, unless outside magics are used to repair the damage.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Momentary, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Do superficial damage to a body (for example, remove its hair).

**Level 10:** Cause a person pain, but do no real damage. Cause the loss of one Fatigue level.

**Level 15:** Do one Body level of damage to a person. Destroy a person's limb. Destroy a corpse.

**Level 20:** Destroy one of a person's major senses. Do two Body levels of damage.

**Level 25:** Age someone five years. Do three Body levels of damage.

**Level 30:** Inflict a major disease. Do four Body levels of damage.

**Level 40:** Kill a person.

## Perdo Corpus Spells

### Level 5

#### Touch of the Goose Feather

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Goose Feather (+3)

The target must make a Stamina stress roll of 9+ or let out a loud sneeze. Spellcasters who sneeze must make Intelligence + Concentration stress rolls of 12+ to maintain concentration, and others get -1 on most activities at the moment of the sneeze.

### Level 10

#### Invocation of Weariness

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Sand (+3)

The target must make a Fatigue roll of 9+ or lose a Fatigue level. The phrases used with this spell are usually singsong melodies, which lull the victim into drowsiness.

<!-- End of page-122-126.md -->


<!-- Start of page-127-131.md -->

### Level 15

#### Dust to Dust

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Bones Ground to Dust (+3)

Turns a dead body or mindless undead body to dust in two rounds. The spell doesn't affect those undead possessed by spirits. Rubbing two or more bones together to make dust during the casting of this spell enhances the effects. To do this to an animal corpse requires a Perdo Animál spell.

#### Grip of the Choking Hand

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Branch of Holly (+3)

The target feels an invisible, strangling hand on the throat. Each round, the target loses a Fatigue level, or a Body level if already unconscious. It requires a Stamina stress roll of 6+ to break the spell, rolled each round. If using the holly spell focus, you point the branch towards the victim while you cast the spell. Holly is dangerous for magi to carry, as peasant superstition holds it to be a harmful plant and it may therefore attract unfavorable attention.

#### The Wound that Weeps

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: +0

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+1)

When casting this spell, you point at the victim, possibly with a branch of holly, and a large wound opens on his or her body. The wound is not a deep one, but it bleeds profusely.

The target must make a Stamina stress roll ever round. If the result is a botch, he loses two Fatigue levels. If the result is 2 or less, one Fatigue level is lost. If the result is 3 to 8, no level is lost. If the roll is 9+, the bleeding stops. An unconscious target loses Body levels instead of Fatigue levels. A target who is active suffers a -3 penalty to these Stamina rolls, and a completely still target receives a +1 bonus. Of course, accumulated Fatigue and wound penalties apply to all rolls. If outside help is received, a Chirurgy stress roll of 6+ stops the bleeding.

### Level 25

#### Bane of the Decrepit Body

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Heart of an Old Man (+3)

The target ages 5 years. Determine afflictions normally. This spell does not work on children younger than age 16. If casting with the focus, you slowly crush the heart, draining the years from the target.

#### Confound the Connection

R: Spec, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: A facsimile of the connection used against you (+5)

Allows you to destroy an item used by another magus as an arcane connection either to you or someone you touch. Use of this spell assumes you know an arcane connection has been made to you or the person you touch, though you don't have to know what item is being used to form the connection. Once this spell is cast, the arcane connection is destroyed. Another connection can only be formed by a magus if he has another of your personal objects.

### Level 30

#### Incantation of the Milky Eyes

R: Reach/Sight, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Blank Glass Eye (+3)

Blinds a target, leaving the eyes milky with cataracts.

#### Twist of the Tongue

R: Near/Sight, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Human Tongue (+3)

Twists the target's tongue into a spiral, completely destroying the ability to speak. A grave offense to a magus.

### Level 40

#### Clenching Grasp of the Crushed Heart

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Human Heart (+3)

When casting this spell, you make a clenching motion with your hand, crushing the spell focus if using one. The victim doubles over at once, and if the victim fails to make a Stamina stress roll of 15+, he or she dies with a crushed heart. If the target's roll succeeds, 5 points of Stamina are still lost; the target is still probably crippled for life, and may die an early death.

#### Curse of the Leprous Flesh

R: Touch/Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Flakes from the Skin of a Leper (+1)

This spell causes a person's flesh to rot off in a matter of weeks—truly hideous sight. Much of the target's flesh literally hangs from his or her frame, and there is a pungent rotting smell about him at all times. Every week, over a period of three months, the target must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or lose a Body level permanently. On a botch, an additional Body level is lost. The target also loses a point of Stamina by the time the spell ends. The magic can be dispelled while it is still in effect, but any damage done is permanent. If the victim somehow survives this curse, he is shunned by mortal communities. If you are casting the spell with flakes from the skin of a leper, you blow them on the victim.

#### The Kiss of Death

R: Touch/Near, D: Mom, T: Ind

The person you kiss dies a sudden death. The only mark on the corpse is the black imprint of your lips. No words or gestures are necessary, though if you apply vis to range, you can "blow" a kiss of death. The target is allowed a Stamina stress roll of 12+ to resist.

### Level 55

#### Curse of the Unportended Plague

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual

Starts a plague in a city or other Boundary. The plague reaches its height in six to twelve months and can spread like any other plague. It is non-magical once begun, and health measures can lessen the effect of the plague. A full-blown plague kills one in ten inhabitants of a city over the course of a few months. Using, or even transcribing, this spell is rigorously discouraged by most of the Order of Hermes.

## Rego Corpus Guidelines

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Make a target lose control of a body part.

**Level 15:** Control the large-scale physical movements of a target.

**Level 20:** Hold a target's the body motionless.

**Level 25:** Control a target's motions. Eliminate the penalties of fatigue and wounds.

**Level 30:** Direct the flow of bodily energy.

**Level 50:** Teleport a target's body to a place you have an arcane connection to. Teleport a target's body seven leagues.

## Rego Corpus Spells

### Level 5

#### Curse of the Unruly Tongue

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+3)

Causes the target to stutter and slur words. Communication rolls are at -3. Spoken spells are at -6 to the spellcasting roll, and there is an extra botch die.

#### Spasms of the Uncontrolled Hand

R: Far/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+3)

The target must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or drop anything held in the target hand.

#### Rise of the Feathery Body

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Feather of an Eagle (+3)

Allows the target to float vertically to any height, carrying up to 50 pounds, and rising as fast as smoke rises, slower if carrying a heavy load. The target cannot move horizontally through this spell.

### Level 10

#### Gift of the Frog's Legs

R: Touch/Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Legs of a Frog (+1)

Allows the target to leap up to 15 feet vertically or 25 feet horizontally (2 feet less for every Encumbrance point). The person must make a Dexterity – Encumbrance stress roll of 6+ to land without injury. A miss indicates the loss of one Body level, and a botch indicates a broken ankle or other crippling injury. The target can only leap once for each casting of the spell, and that leap must be made within ten seconds. As with a frog's leap, a running start does not improve the leap.

### Level 15

#### Despair of the Quivering Manacles

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mannequin of the Target (+5)

Your target shakes vigorously from side to side without falling. Those affected get -3 on rolls requiring physical movement, and -1 to most other rolls.

#### Endurance of the Berserkers

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Lock of Hair from a Berserker (+3)

The target's body acts as though it were unwounded and unfatigued for as long as you concentrate (or until sunrise or sunset if vis is used to increase duration). Keep track of the actual Body and Fatigue levels that the body loses while "berserk," because as soon as the spell wears off, the target loses those levels. If the target runs out of Body levels at any time during the spell, the spell terminates immediately and the character dies. If the target runs out of Fatigue levels, the spell terminates immediately and the character falls unconscious.

Consecutive castings on a character delay the end of the spell—that is, put off the time when accumulated wounds take effect—but a body can only take a number of consecutive castings equal to its Size + 2. Further castings have no effect.

#### Lifting the Dangling Puppet

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mannequin of the Target (+3)

Lifts a person of Size +1 or less vertically into the air. Generally, you can make the target rise or descend as fast as smoke rises, but a heavier person rises more slowly and falls more quickly.

### Level 20

#### The Gift of Vigor

R: Touch/Near, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+3)

Transfers bodily energy from you to any target who is at a lower Fatigue level than you. You are thus at the target's current Fatigue level, and he or she assumes your previous level. If you lose a Fatigue level from casting this spell, the loss comes after the transfer. Magi have long looked for a way to restore their energy in order to cast more spells. This is the closest they've come. The ruby is associated with Mars, representing vigor and strength.

### Level 25

#### Awaken the Slumbering Corpse

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

Causes a corpse to function at your verbal command. Commands have to be very simple, like “attack anyone who comes through here.” Use the statistics on [page 253](../page-refs/page-253.md) for zombies (if some flesh is still intact) or skeletons (if most flesh is gone). The corpse used cannot have been buried by Church ceremony.

#### Strings of the Unwilling Marionette

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mannequin of the Target (+3)

You can control the physical movements of a person, such as walking, standing, and turning. If the target resists the control, the movements are jerky. The target can yell, but you can prevent intelligible speech by controlling the target’s mouth. The target must be conscious to be moved about. A Strength stress roll of 12+ allows resistance, rolled each round.

### Level 35

#### The Leap of Homecoming

R: Per/Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+1)

Teleports you, or one you touch, back to the one place you know best (probably your laboratory), provided it is within 150 miles. You must have an arcane connection with the place you are leaping to, such as a tile from the floor, or a chunk of the wall. The opal is the stone of Mercury and is thought to bring good journeys.

#### Seven-League Stride

R: Per/Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+1)

Teleports you or one you touch to any place within seven leagues either that you can see or that you have an arcane connection with. If you fail an Intelligence + Finesse stress roll of 9+, your arrival goes slightly awry. For instance, you might fall when you appear, or just be facing the wrong way. A botch means you appear in the wrong place, perhaps even in a wall.

Praefactus of Bonisagus’s version of this spell always allows him to appear in a safe, unembarrassing place (assuming he doesn’t fail his Finesse roll). All Praefactus’s spells make him seem as dignified as possible—manifesting his wizard’s sigil.

### Level 45

#### The Walking Corpse

R: Reach, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Requisite: Mentem

Turns a corpse into a nearly mindless servant that can follow your simple verbal commands faithfully but unimaginatively. If the corpse still has most of its flesh, it becomes a zombie; if not, it becomes an animated skeleton. Unless the corpse is preserved with Charm Against Putrefaction or the equivalent, the body decays normally.
