# Auram Spells
Auram spells are powerful because the element of air is ubiquitous. Their weakness is that air is not usually violent, like fire, nor strong, like earth. Auram, however, includes in its scope most weather phenomena such as storms, lightning, rain, mist, and falling snow. Auram spells usually affect air as phenomena (winds, odors) rather than as gases (a modern concept).

## Creo Auram Guidelines
The basic range is Sight, the basic duration is Momentary, and the basic target is Boundary. Created air disperses at a natural rate (because the duration is Momentary). Non-weather effects should be gauged by their effect relative to the guidelines. For example, poisonous gas doing +5 damage might be roughly equivalent to the amount of damage caused by a tempest.

Sigils in Creo Auram spells commonly give the air specific properties, such as special scents or colors.

**Level 5:** Create a draft.

**Level 10:** Create a breeze.

**Level 15:** Create a wind. Create a fog.

**Level 20:** Create a squall.

**Level 25:** Create a thunderstorm.

**Level 30:** Create a tempest.

**Level 45:** Create a hurricane.

**Level 60:** Create lightning.

## Creo Auram Spells

### Level 1

#### Air's Ghostly Form
R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+5)

A thick fog forms around the magus, extending outwards for several paces. A breeze can push the fog around. The fog dissipates at its natural rate, and may be all gone within as short a time as a minute. The opal has associations with Mercury and the air.

### Level 5

#### Chamber of Spring Breezes
R: Reach, D: Sun/Perm, T: Room/Str

Spell Focus: An Agate (+3)

Requisite: Rego

Creates a breeze of fresh air that continually moves throughout a room, keeping the air continuously breathable even if the room is airtight. Rose of Jerbiton's version of this spell always causes the air to smell of roses.

### Level 10

#### Jupiter's Resounding Blow
R: Far, D: Mom, T: Group

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Violet Amethyst (+5)

Creates a thunderclap; anyone directly underneath must make a Stamina stress roll of 9+ or be deafened. If deafened, the target gets another Stamina simple roll each minute and recovers with a roll of 9+. If the first roll botches, the victim is rendered deaf for a month. Violet amethyst is the stone of Jupiter.

#### Stench of the Twenty Corpses
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Piece of a Rotting Corpse (+3)

Makes the surrounding air stink horribly of rotting corpses, until the odor dissipates naturally. All those within 10 paces of the target point must make Stamina stress rolls of 6+ or act with a -3 penalty on all rolls. Anyone who botches the roll vomits and is incapacitated for (10 - Stamina) rounds.

### Level 15

#### Charge of the Angry Winds
R: Near, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: An Agate (+1)

A wall of wind roars away from you, starting up to 10 paces away and continuing up to 30 paces. The wind is 5 paces wide. All within the area must make a Dexterity + Size stress roll of 9+ or fall down and be blown along by the winds. The rolls must be made at the start of the gale and each subsequent round that the wind is maintained. You must concentrate on the gale, but you may only maintain it for a maximum of five rounds. Missile fire into or out of the gale is futile, and marching against the gale requires a Strength + Size stress roll of 15+. Failure in this attempt mandates another Dexterity + Size stress roll of 12+ to keep from falling.

#### Wreaths of Foul Smoke
R: Far/Sight, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Dollop of Mud from a Marsh (+1)

Thick, yellow, sulfurous smoke rises up from the spot you designate, filling a circular area 9 paces across. It blocks sight, and for each round anyone breathes the smoke, a Stamina stress roll of 9+ must be made or a Fatigue level is lost. Once a character is Unconscious, further failed rolls result in the loss of Body levels. The smoke dissipates naturally; it may persist for less than a minute in the open, or it may hang in a closed room for hours. The area where the spell is cast will be damaged: small plants wilt and die, and tree growth is stunted. A faint stench of sulfur clings for days to anything exposed to the smoke.

### Level 25

#### Clouds of Rain and Thunder
R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Bound

Spell Focus: The Essence of an Air Elemental (+3)

Creates a severe rainstorm, including lightning and winds. It takes half an hour for the clouds to form and start raining, during which the magus must maintain concentration. The storm rages on for ten minutes after the caster ceases to concentrate on it, and calms down to nothing over the next twenty minutes.

#### Clouds of Summer Snow
R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Bound

Spell Focus: Ice Shavings (+3)

Creates clouds that drop snow out to the horizon. It takes half an hour for the clouds to form and start snowing, during which the caster must continue to concentrate on it. The snow stops ten minutes after the caster ceases to concentrate on it, and the clouds disperse over the next twenty minutes. The spell does not affect temperature.

### Level 35

#### The Incantation of Lightning
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Aimed: -3

Spell Focus: An Oak Wand (see below) (+3)

A lightning bolt shoots forth from your outstretched hand in the direction you are pointing, doing +45 damage to a single target it hits. Those near the target must make Size stress rolls of 6+ to remain standing. The oak wand need not be magical, but must be from a tree struck three times by lightning.

### Level 40

#### Breath of the Open Sky
R: Per, D: Spec, T: Spec, Ritual

You can call up a wind capable of devastating the countryside. You must stand under the open sky to cast this spell. Once you have completed the ritual, a breeze picks up in front of you. As long as you face in the same direction, the wind grows in speed and breadth. After a half an hour has passed, the wind is a gale roaring over the visible countryside and beyond, strong enough to topple wooden structures and knock down trees. If you turn away from your original facing for more than a few seconds, you have to make a Concentration roll of 12+ to maintain the spell. If you turn away for a minute or more, the spell ends.

### Level 60

#### Wrath of Whirling Winds and Water
R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Spec, Ritual

The spell can only be cast at sea or at the coast, and creates an immense storm, 40 or more miles wide, of hurricane intensity. The storm takes three or four hours to form completely, and rages for at least a day, or longer if it is cast during time when storms are common in the region. The gale-force winds and lashing waves cause immense damage along shorelines. Visibility is reduced to a few paces, missile fire is futile, and travel is nearly suicidal. Weak structures are blown over, and all but most seaworthy ships are certain to flounder unless they can be beached before the storm reaches full intensity. You must be able to see the area where you want to center the spell. The cyclone dissipates at the storyguide's discretion, but lasts for at least a day.

## Intéllego Auram Guidelines
Basic range is Personal, basic duration is Concentration, basic target is Room.

**Level 5:** Sense one property of air (for example, determine if it is safe to breathe).

**Level 10:** Learn all mundane properties of the air. Have an intuition about some fact regarding the air.

**Level 15:** Make your senses unhindered by the air (for example, you can hear over a howling wind).

**Level 20:** Predict the weather.

**Level 25:** Speak with air.

### Level 15

#### True Sight of the Air
R: Per/Touch, D: Conc/Moon, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Four-Leaf Clover (+1)

Lets you see clearly through all manner of obfuscation in the air nearby, including smoke, fog, and dust, even if the obfuscation is magical. The clover is said to help you see through deceptions and obstructions.

#### Whispering Winds
R: Sight, D: Conc/Moon, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Three Leaves from an Oak Tree (+1)

The winds bear their tidings to your ears, allowing you to hear words spoken by any group of people within your line of sight, provided no solid barrier (including glass) intervenes.

### Level 25

#### Eyes of the Bat
R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: The Eyes of a Bat (+1)

You can move about confidently in complete darkness by sensing air and its boundaries (for example, where solid objects are). The spell ends when you can see normally, or when, for any reason, you stop using blind navigation.

#### Sailor's Foretaste of the Morrow
R: Per, D: Mom, T: Bound

Spell Focus: The Liver of a Pig (+1)

You know precisely what tomorrow's weather will be, and you gain a general impression about the weather for the week ahead.

## Muto Auram Guidelines
The basic range is Near, basic duration is Momentary and basic target is Small. Transforming only one property of air generally lowers the level by one order of magnitude.

**Level 4:** Double or halve the intensity of a manifestation of air.

**Level 5:** Transform an amount of air into another form of air.

**Level 10:** Transform an amount of air into another element. Transform an amount of air into a gas that does +5 damage.

**Level 15:** Transform an amount of air into a mixture of elements. Transform an amount of air into something slightly unnatural (for example, into silvery fog or a specific shape).

**Level 20:** Transform an amount of air into something wholly unnatural (for example, transform a cloud into a horse shape that gallops across the sky).

### Level 5

#### Blasting Wind, Blinding Mist
R: Near/Far, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Air Bottled During a Storm (+1)

Doubles the strength or intensity of one minor air phenomenon, such as fog, smoke, or odor.

### Level 20

#### Clouds of Thunderous Might
R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: The Essence of an Air Elemental (+5)

Changes rain clouds into a full-fledged storm. The storm is non-magical, and lasts as long as a normal storm, usually several hours. This spell cannot be used to make an already existing storm more severe.

#### Rain of Stones
R: Far/Sight, D: Mom, T: Group

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Hailstone (+1)

Requisites: Terram

Turns rain into stones as it falls on a Group, causing +15 damage. If the spell focus is used, it must be thrown into the air.

### Level 30

#### Talons of the Winds
R: Near/Far, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Claw of a Hawk (+1)

Transforms a wind into an abrasive medium that tears and claws at everything in its path. Soft materials like leaves and cloth are shredded, and people take +5 damage from innumerable bloody cuts and abrasions. This spell cannot be cast if there is not a breeze of some sort blowing, thus making it difficult to use effectively indoors. The caster is not affected by the spell, even if the wind is blowing directly at him.

In Ossium of Bjornaer's version of this spell, which has an Imáginem requisite, a strange keening can be heard in the air as it cuts through targets. Ossium's wizards sigil manifests by making many of his spells eerie or frightening.

#### Heat of Hell's Impending Doom
R: Per, D: Conc/Moon, T: Bound, Ritual

Requisites: Ignem, Rego

Air in the target area grows painfully hot, with the exception of the area within 10 feet of you. Those caught in this heat must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ every round or lose a Fatigue level. Body levels are lost once Fatigue levels are gone. Plants exposed to this heat for any long period of time will wither and die.

### Level 40

#### Infernal Smoke of Death
R: Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Breath from a Poisonous Snake (+3)

Requisites: Perdo

Turns normal smoke from a fire into a thick, poisonous cloud. Anyone immersed the cloud of smoke takes +20 poison damage (once only) against which armor provides on half its normal Protection value. Soft materials like cloth, fur, paper, and leather are charred and ruined by exposure to the noxious vapor. While you concentrate, any new smoke becomes poisonous, but even after you stop concentrating, the poisonous smoke remains deadly. It dissipates after several hours. The smoke is heavier than air, so rolls along the ground, pooling in low spots. With a Rego casting requisite, the caster and the objects he carries are unaffected by the smoke, though it still obscures his vision.

### Level 45

#### Fog of Confusion
R: Per, D: Year/Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Requisites: Imáginem, Rego

Turns all the fog within the target area into a silvery mist too thick to see through. Random screams, thumps, hisses, and other noises harass and confuse anyone within the fog, perhaps even leading them into danger. People have extreme difficulty navigating through the fog, especially through unknown territory. No more than seven people, who must be present at the ritual, can see normally through the fog.

### Level 50

#### Rain of Oil
R: Sight, D: Spec, T: Sight, Ritual

Requisites: Ignem

Turns rain into droplets of oil. The rain of oil continues as long as the storm does, drenching the landscape with flammable liquid. The oil will evaporate at a natural rate after the rain ceases. A spontaneous Creo Ignem spell of level 25+ can ignite the storm so that the oil burns as it falls.

## Perdo Auram Guidelines
Destroying just one property of air is a bit easier than destroying air outright—such destructions are one magnitude lower than spells that destroy air outright. Causing the destruction of air with great precision raises the order of magnitude by at least one level.

Basic range is Touch, basic duration Momentary and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5:** Destroy an amount of air. Stop very minor weather phenomena, like breezes.

**Level 20:** Stop any one part of a weather phenomenon (for example, stop lightning from striking during a thunderstorm).

**Level 30:** Stop any weather phenomenon, excluding those caused by Ritual magic.

### Level 10

#### Thief of the Stolen Breath
R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+3)

Takes a creature's breath out of its lungs, causing panic and the instant loss of a Fatigue level, plus a second level unless a Stamina stress roll of 6+ is made. Casting requisite is Animál for beasts and Corpus for people. This spell cannot effect a target more than once a round.

### Level 15

#### Room of Stale Air
R: Reach, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: Agate (+3)

Makes the air in a room stuffy and uncomfortable. Any creatures that breathe air suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls involving physical exertion. In addition, for each round of exertion a character must make a simple Stamina roll of 6+ or lose a Fatigue level. This may cause panic in some creatures or people. The speed at which the air refreshes itself depends on how well ventilated the room is. When using agate, a stone associated with both Mercury and the air, you must crush the rock. Through the Law of Sympathy, this helps destroy air within the area.

### Level 20

#### Quiet the Raging Winds
R: Per, D: Mom, T: Bound

Spell Focus: A Branch of Ash (+1)

Stops all wind from blowing, leaving only calm air. This spell is not powerful enough to effect winds caused by Ritual magic. The branch of ash is said to provide protection from storms.

### Level 35

#### The Cloudless Sky Returned
R: Per, D: Spec, T: Sight

Spell Focus: A Branch of Ash (+1)

This spell clears the sky within your vision of any clouds or other meteorological activity, either naturally occurring or caused by magic. The clouds take a few minutes to clear, during which time you must concentrate on them. This spell only affects meteorological activity in progress at the moment of casting, and is not powerful enough to dispel a weather condition caused by Ritual magic.

In Ferramentum's version of this spell, the clouds clear from the sky in an orderly manner, as if they were soldiers marching on parade.

## Rego Auram Guidelines
If you are affecting small amounts of air, the basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration and basic target is Individual. As with CrAu, targets often manifest as non-bounded areas. A Small effect in the absence of a container is about one half a pace across, an Individual effect is about one pace across, a Room effect (which can occur outside in this case) is about five paces across, a Structure effect (again, can occur outside) is about 20 paces across.

Controlling an amount of air with great strength or great precision raises the magnitude of the spell by one level.

**General:** Ward against Faerie creatures of the air whose Might is less than or equal to the level of the spell (duration Ring, target Group)

**Level 5:** Control an amount of air.

**Level 10:** Control an amount of air with great force.

**Level 20:** Direct weather in progress. Control an amount of air with enough force to uproot small trees.

**Level 30:** Cause clouds to produce rain. Control an amount of air with enough force to uproot large trees.

### General

#### Ward Against Faeries of the Air
R: Near, D: Ring, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

As Ward Against Faeries of the Water (ReAq Gen), but for faeries of the air. The Faerie cannot directly or indirectly break the magic circle, nor can they use ranged attacks or magic to affect those within it. From some angles at night, the ring may be seen as a violet-hued dome.

### Level 4

#### Wind at the Back
R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Hand Fan (+1)

A breeze follows you until you stop traveling for more than ten minutes. It causes phenomena you pass through (fog, haze) to follow you.

### Level 15

#### Broom of the Winds
R: Near/Far, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Splinter from a Broom (+1)

Whips up violent, swirling winds around the target. The target must make a Size stress roll of 9+ to remain standing. If the target is braced or holding onto some support, he may also make a Strength stress roll of 9+. If both rolls fail, the target is knocked in a random direction. The target may be damaged, depending on whether he strikes anything.

#### Circling Winds of Protection
R: Per/Touch, D: Spec/Sun, T: Room

Spell Focus: Bottled Breath of a Zephyr (+5)

Surrounds you with winds that circle at great speed. Since the wind picks up dust and other small, loose objects, you may be obscured. Anyone standing near enough to attack you with a hand weapon must make a Size stress roll of 9+ at the beginning of each round or be blown back. Melee Attack rolls against you are at -3, and missile or thrown attacks are at -9. The wind blows while you concentrate, and then continues for five rounds after you stop. The zephyr's breath is released to encourage winds to blow faster.

### Level 20

#### Wings of the Soaring Wind
R: Per, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Feather from a Bird of Legendary Size (+3)

<!-- End of page-117-121.md -->


<!-- Start of page-122-126.md -->

## Level 30

### Gathering of the Stormy Might

R: Per, D: Spec, T: Sight

Spell Focus: The Essence of an Air Elemental (+3)

Calls the surrounding clouds into a storm within one hour. The size of the storm depends on the amount of cloud cover available. The storm lasts for a length of time based on the amount of cloud cover present. The duration of the rainfall can vary from just fifteen minutes for thin, wispy clouds to several hours if the sky is already overcast. This spell cannot be used on an utterly clear sky. While this spell cannot be used to make an already exiting storm more severe, it will can be used to cause a gathering storm to break almost immediately.

### Pull of the Skybound Winds

R: Near/Far, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Captured Gust of Wind from a Tornado (+3)

Makes winds rise upward, pulling one object, creature, or person up to 50 feet into the sky before letting that target drop. Even a small building can be torn from its foundation, though such a building can be no larger than 20 feet to a side, and cannot be built out of a material heavier than stout wood. Uprooted objects fall randomly, unless you make a Finesse stress roll of 12+ to choose where the objects will fall.
