# Vim Spells

Vim spells are very useful. They help you use your spells to better effect, and since using spells efficiently is what being a master magus is all about, these spells are very important. With imagination, you can use these spells to make wards, alarms, one-use magic items, and other interesting things. Many Vim spells are meant to be cast along with other spells, and modify or change their effects. Such Vim spells have no spell foci.

Vim magic also encompasses dealing with demons. Summoning and dealing with demons is prohibited within the Order, but fighting them is allowed.

Magi often use Vim to counteract magical phenomena. Storyguides should assign spell levels for all magical phenomena that those using Vim counterspells will have to match.

Most Vim spells are of General level, because the magic that Vim spells affect varies widely in power. A spell to dispel a first magnitude spell needs to be much less powerful than a similar spell to dispel a fifth magnitude effect. The guidelines provided for Vim spells take account of this, and rather than giving an absolute level for a corresponding effect, they give the relationship that the level of the Vim spell must bear to the level of the target. Thus, the guideline for creating a ward against demons states that the level of the ward plus a quality die minus 5 must exceed the Might of the demon.

As usual, these guidelines refer to a spell with the basic range, duration and target. When changing these parameters the change in level should be taken account of before multiplying or dividing the spell level to get the effect. Thus, a version of Wind of Mundane Silence (PeVi) with Far range would dispel a spell cast with a Technique + Form total of less than half (spell level - 10). Ten levels of the spell's power are devoted to increasing the range, and only the remaining power is available for the effect.

The Individual target for a Vim spell can refer to either an individual spell, or an individual object or person, and similarly for Group. If the target is an object or person, the Vim spell will affect any suitable magic affecting that person, not just one spell. Most such spells can only be cast on either other spells or individuals, but, if the description suggests that they could be cast on either, then they can. For example, Mirror of Opposition can only be cast on other spells, while The Invisible Eye Revealed can only be cast on people or objects.

The guidelines below refer mainly to spells. This is for the sake of brevity, as Vim spells can affect magical effects proceeding from magical items, magical creatures, or demons. However, unless specifically stated otherwise, the spells do not affect magical items, only the effects that they produce. Thus, Wind of Mundane Silence could dispel a stone wall produced by a magical item, but Disenchant is needed to dispel the magic of the item itself.

It should be noted that Hermetic magi, and some non-Hermetic wizards, do not have Might scores, and thus are not affected by wardings or other spells that act against Might scores.

## Creo Vim Guidelines

There are few Creo Vim spells known throughout the Order. The basic range is Touch, the basic duration is Sun, which usually boosts to Permanent, and the basic target is Individual.

Gen: Create a magical shell which looks real to Intéllego spells with penetration less than twice its level (this aura is generic 'magic' only—no misleading information can be supplied). Create a magical shell which prevents Intéllego spells with penetration less than its level from learning any details about the magic on the target. Create a magical shell which gives false information about the target to Intéllego spells with penetration less than half its level.

## Creo Vim Spells

### Shell of False Determinations

**R:** Touch, **D:** Perm, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

Creates a "shell" of magic on an item, helping to shield it from investigation by other magi. All attempts to investigate the magic item give false information about its powers unless half of the level of the shell is exceeded by the magus's Investigation roll. The duration is higher than normal because this is a Ritual, and thus is always boosted with vis.

### Shell of Opaque Mysteries

**R:** Touch, **D:** Perm, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

This spell is similar to Shell of False Determinations (above), but it causes all attempts to investigate the magic item to utterly fail, unless the level of the ritual is exceeded by the magus's Investigation roll. Once a magus determines the presence of a particular shell (that is, by overcoming it), it has no more power against him or her.

### The Phantom Gift

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Sun/Perm, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Bat Wings (+1)

The target of the spell becomes tainted with magic as most magi are. Beasts and people react to the target as though he were a magus. Those who normally associate with the victim do not become hostile, but do give him or her a wider berth. The spell has no effect on those who already have the Gift, including those blessed with the Gentle Gift.

## Intéllego Vim Guidelines

Since magic is a tricky thing to understand, spells that detect magic are at once difficult and important. Although demons deal in Vim, they are made of the essence of deception itself. If a demon does not wish to be detected, it cannot be (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), and for this reason there are no demon-locating magics. Magic items cannot be investigated with simple magic spells. Investigation requires that you spend at least one season in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains (see the Laboratory chapter). A spell will suffice to tell you that an item is magical, however, and may give you some idea of its powers. Spells will never tell you how to use an item.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

A first magnitude Intéllego Vim spell will detect magical effects of tenth magnitude or higher. For every magnitude by which the detecting spell is increased, decrease the minimum spell to be detected by two magnitudes. Thus, a sixth magnitude spell will detect "zero magnitude" effects: the traces of powerful magic, or the recent presence of weak magic. Further increases in level will give increased sensitivity to residues. This level of spell also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of the magic (within a magnitude). The addition of one magnitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well. The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other types of magic. Further increases in level will yield further information, depending on the design of the specific spell.

Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spell only affects one realm, and storyguides may wish to disallow spells to detect the Divine or Infernal.

As a general rule, residues of magic decline as follows. As soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves. It then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes. Storyguides should employ this as a guideline, not a rigid formula, and may, if they wish, allow high level detection spells to pick up residues with 'negative magnitude'.

Magical items have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawns of vis used to open the enchantment (or half the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices). Magnitudes of non-Hermetic items must be set by the storyguide. A spell to detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice-versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above.

Magical creatures can also be detected. Treat their Might as the level of the effect: for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might or highest Art by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude. Again, this requires a different spell, and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures. Demons may not be detected. Storyguides may, at their option, allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead.

Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrelevant, as is the realm of power that it was designed to detect. However, only specially designed spells will yield any information other than that it is raw vis.

### The Invisible Eye Revealed

**R:** Per, **D:** Conc/Year, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Eye of Newt (+3)

The caster can see a visual representation of any magical means currently being used to spy on him. The representation varies in a way that depends on the spell, but it often looks like some kind of eye floating in the air. For example, a magus being spied upon with Enchantment of the Scrying Pool might see an eye of the deepest blue color, while a magus who is being tracked by The Inexorable Search might see a representation of a small figure of him moving about a map. This spell detects the use of Intéllego spells of up to double the level of this spell. A special spell is required because most Intéllego spells are designed to be subtle, and they are more subtle at higher levels.

### Scales of the Magical Weight

**R:** Touch, **D:** Inst, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** A Set of Scales (+3)

When casting this spell, you typically hold your hands straight out from your body, place a known amount of Vim vis in your left hand (usually one pawn), and then place an unknown amount of vis in your right hand. After casting the spell, you may sense how heavy the unknown vis is in relation to the known, determining the number of pawns present. When using the focus to help empower the spell, you place the vis in the pans of the scale, and the scale shifts to make obvious the relationship between the two. A common technique is to enchant one of the pans of the scale with a pawn of vis, as if it were being prepared as a magic item, so that there is no need to carry a pawn of raw vis about. If you cast the spell without anything to measure the unknown vis against, you only have a very general idea of how valuable it is. The spell cannot be used to determine the amount of raw vis invested in an enchanted item.

### Sense the Nature of Vis

**R:** Touch/Near, **D:** Inst, **T:** Small

**Spell Focus:** Sapphire (+5)

You can tell what Art a supply of raw vis is connected to. To you, the vis appears to glow with an aura that is appropriate to the Technique or Form that the vis is associated with. Creo is white, Intéllego gold, Muto constantly fluctuating, Perdo black, Rego purple, Animál brown, Aquam blue, Auram violet, Corpus dark red, Herbam green, Imáginem pearly blue, Ignem bright red, Mentem orange, Terram dark brown, and Vim silver. Some of the colors are very similar, but are easy to distinguish if the item is held steadily and studied for a few seconds.

### Sense of the Lingering Magic

**R:** Near, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Sapphire (+1)

This spell can detect the presence of many magical residues, even from weak spells, as well as giving the presence and power of active spells. It does not grant any information apart from the power, however.

### Sight of the Active Magics

**R:** Near, **D:** Conc/Moon, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Ergot (+3)

You can see spells as "auras" around things and people. The color of the aura indicates the Form of the spell working on a subject, the color matching the appropriate one described in Sense the Nature of Vis (above). The Technique of a spell working on the subject is recognized by the aura's shape, not color. Creo and Rego are both very orderly auras. Muto is constantly shifting, and Intéllego usually is as well, but more slowly. A Perdo aura is usually in fragments. Thus, a magus with both Endurance of the Berserkers and The Invisible Eye Revealed upon him has a very controlled, orderly aura of deep red around his or her entire body, and the magus's eyes are surrounded with slowly shifting auras of a silvery hue. You should be warned: Imáginem or Vim spells may be used to disguise auras. Also note that this spell will detect the residues of some spells. The ergot fungus, which may be used in this spell, is a very dangerous faerie plant that grows in wheat. It is sprinkled over your head during the spell.

## Muto Vim Guidelines

These spells let you change other spells. The basic range is Reach, the basic duration is Special (these spells are not well described by the standard durations), and the basic target is Individual. Most Muto Vim spells last as long as the spell that they have altered.

These meta-magical spells have certain special restrictions, which apply to all Muto Vim spells invented according to Hermetic theory. First of all, they cannot be cast on spontaneous spells. Such magic is being manipulated at whim—any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control.

Secondly, when you cast a MuVi spell, you get double the normal botch dice. Magi who have mastered the spell roll the normal number. Even if the spell is mastered, you must roll a stress die. The same applies to the spell that you are casting on, even if it is being cast by another magus, and even if it is mastered. If either spell botches, both do.

Thirdly, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+ if you are casting both spells (that is, the MuVi spell and the spell it is affecting). If this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch. You don't have to double botch dice on it, though.

If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus, you must either be co-operating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell spontaneously. There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition, your Penetration total for the Muto Vim spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are co-operating.

These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depend on a good understanding of the processes involved.

You may only put a Muto Vim effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All Muto Vim spells require some tailoring to the specific use, hence the additional botch dice, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored.

Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way: it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants. See the example spells for ideas on how specific this should be.

**Gen:** Superficially change a spell of less than twice the level of the Vim spell. This may not change the primary effect of the spell, or its power.

**Gen:** Significantly change a spell of less than the level of the Vim spell. This may not change either the Technique or Form of the target spell. A change in power of plus or minus one magnitude is a significant change, as is a change of target, if the target was possible for the original spell.

**Gen:** Totally change a spell of less than half the level of the Vim spell. This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts. The Vim spell affects the structure of the spell, not the things that the spell targets. A change in power of up to two magnitudes is a total change. Any greater change requires either Creo or Perdo to create more magical energy or destroy some.

### Muto Vim Spells

#### General

##### Mirror of Opposition (Form)

**R:** Reach, **D:** Spec, **T:** Ind

Cast on another spell while the other spell is being cast, this causes the targeted spell to have the exact opposite of its normal effects. This effect works on spells up to half the level of the Mirror of Opposition spell. The effects of the inversion are up to the storyguide to determine, but the target of the inverted spell usually remains the same as that of the original spell. The inverted spell cannot overcome any limitations of Hermetic magic. For example, if an Instant Perdo Corpus spell is cast, the inversion is probably a Creo Corpus spell of Sun duration. There are ten versions of this spell, each affecting spells of one of the Hermetic forms.

##### Shroud Magic

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Spec, **T:** Ind

This spell allows a magus to suppress or alter the sigil in a spell that is currently being cast, or which has been cast and is still active. The spell to be shrouded can be up to double the Shroud's level.

##### The Sorcerer's Fork

**R:** Reach, **D:** Spec, **T:** Ind

This spell splits another spell (whose level must be less than the level of this spell) into two or more identical spells of reduced power, which may be cast against two or more separate targets. Each resulting spell has the same range, duration, and target (target category, that is—the actual target may be different) as the original spell, but the power of the effect is divided by the number of resulting split spells. The precise effect is at storyguide discretion. One penetration die is rolled, and the penetration total is split between the spells. The Sorcerer's Fork must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell that is to be split. The split spell has a targeting penalty as for multiple casting ([see page 75](../page-refs/page-75.md)). If the casting magus is not co-operating, all the split spells will strike the original target.

###### Wizard's Boost (Form)

**R:** Reach, **D:** Spec, **T:** Ind

You cast this spell as another spell of a level less than this one is cast. The effect of the other spell increases 5 levels in power, but not past the level of the Wizard's Boost. The effects of the extra 5 levels of power are for the storyguide to determine. A Wizard's Boost may never affect a single spell more than once. There are ten versions of this spell, one for each Hermetic Form. There are other versions of this spell, each of which affects one of range, duration, and target, for any Form. Storyguides may find this spell unbalancing, and may disallow it at their option.

###### Wizard's Communion

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Spec, **T:** Group

This spell lets magi combine their power to cast spells. The group of magi work together to cast a specified spell through the unified power of the Communion. Only one extra magus may join the Communion for each 5 levels of the specified spell being cast. One of the magi in the group must also know the specified spell, or must cast it from a text.

All the magi in the gathering who know Wizard's Communion add the level at which they know it to get the effective level of the Wizard's Communion. This combined total must be at least twice the level of the specified spell being cast.

Each magus rolls for fatigue and for success as if casting the specified spell himself. However, the target number for the spellcasting roll is the spell's level divided by the number of magi participating in the Communion. So if five magi participate to cast a 50th level spell, each would have to successfully cast a 10th level spell—with all the relevant requisites, of course. If any magus fails to cast the spell, the whole spell fails. If all succeed, the spell is cast. Any vis needed to cast the spell may be split between the magi involved in the Communion, and the penetration of the final spell is either the spell level, or the highest Penetration total rolled by a participant, whichever is higher. The use of this spell does not increase the number of botch dice required, but each magus in the communion has the chance to botch the common spell.

Communion is a remnant of Mercurian rituals, so spontaneous spells may not be cast by this means, and it does not perfectly fit into the guidelines of Hermetic theory. This spell is usually used to cast protection spells on the covenant—spells that are too powerful for a single magus to cast, or even learn.

##### Level 15

###### Gather the Essence of the Beast

**R:** Touch/Near, **D:** Inst, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Silver Globe (+3)

Concentrates the raw vis in a corpse into one part of that corpse, which can then be removed. This spell lets you gather all the raw vis you find without lugging around entire corpses of beasts. Note that the vis in many magical creatures is already concentrated in this manner in some specific organ, though this spell will allow you to relocate that vis if you wish.

### Perdo Vim Guidelines

The basic range is Reach, the basic duration is Instant, and the basic target is Individual.

**Gen:** Make something (including a magical item) seem nonmagical to any Intéllego spell of less than twice the level of this spell. Basic duration for this is Sun.

**Gen:** Dispel effects of a specific type with a casting total less than the level of the Vim spell + a quality die. A specific type could be Hermetic Terram magic, or Shamanic spirit control magic. A magus must have some knowledge of a type of magic (although not necessarily ability to use it) to invent a spell to affect it. All Hermetic magi have some knowledge of all Hermetic magic.

**Gen:** Reduce a target's Might by one point for every point by which the level of the Vim spell + a quality die exceeds its Might. Different spells are required for creatures tied to different Realms.

**Gen:** Dispel any magical effect with a casting total less than half the level of the Vim spell + a quality die.

**Gen:** Reduce the casting total for all magic cast by, in, or on the target by half the level of the spell. Note that one spell will either reduce totals for magic cast by the target, or in the target, or on the target, but not two or three of them. Which one is to be affected must be determined at the time the spell is invented. Basic duration is Sun. If two or more such spells affect one target, only the highest has any effect: the penalties do not add.

#### Perdo Vim Spells

##### General

###### Demon's Eternal Oblivion

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Inst, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** Pure Red Coral (+3)

Weakens and possibly destroys a demon. Roll a quality die + this spell's level - 5. For every point by which you exceed the target's Infernal Might, it loses one point of Infernal Might. If its score drops to 0, the demon is banished back to Hell for an indeterminate amount of time. If you know the demon's true name, you may double your roll, due to the Law of Names, which, like the Laws of Contagion and Sympathy, may be used to strengthen your spells. Note that repeated castings of this spell are particularly effective, as the earlier castings reduce the number that you have to beat.

###### Disenchant

**R:** Touch/Near, **D:** Inst, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

**Spell Focus:** A Pinch of Salt (+1)

You make a Hermetic magic item lose all its powers permanently if the level of this spell + 5 + a quality die exceeds the highest level of the enchantments in the item. The enchantment is utterly destroyed, as is all of the vis that was used in the magic item. The object left is in all ways a mundane item, but could be invested with enchantments again at a later time.

###### Masking the Odor of Magic

**R:** Touch/Near, **D:** Sun/Year, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Dab of Skunk Musk (+3)

Prevents the detection of a magic spell, or of a magic power in an item or being, by InVi magic, unless the Penetration roll of the InVi spell exceeds twice the level of this spell + 5 (for example, exceeds 15 for a level 5 version).

###### Wind of Mundane Silence

**R:** Reach/Near, **D:** Inst, **T:** Room

**Spell Focus:** Amber (+3)

You raise a metaphorical "breeze" that blows the magic away from an area, canceling the effects of any spell there. You can cancel the effects of any spell if, with this spell, you can double the original caster's Technique + Form score (at the time he or she cast the spell) on a quality die + the level of your spell - 5. If the spell to be eliminated was not cast by a Hermetic magus, the number to match is double the caster's Might score. If the spell was from a magic item, the value to beat is double the level of the spell. Parmae can be blown down if the total exceeds double (5 x Parma Magica). Wind of Mundane Silence does not affect spells of Instant duration. Magical things near the area of the Wind wave slightly from the "breeze."

### Rego Vim Guidelines

Rego Vim spells repel demons. Theoretically, it is possible to conjure and control demons through Rego Vim spells, but this knowledge and its use are forbidden by the Hermetic Code. Any who find and dare to use this knowledge face dangers from both the beings they deal with and those in the Order of Hermes who strongly object to such practices.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

**Gen:** Ward the target against creatures with Might less than the level of the spell + a quality die. A creature warded against cannot directly affect the target physically or by magical means. A spell of this nature will only ward against creatures from one Realm (magical, Infernal, or faerie—Hermetic magic cannot ward against the Divine). Note that wards against magical and faerie creatures can also be constructed using other Forms, but that those wards are more limited in effect.

**Gen:** Give the target Magic Resistance equal to the level of the spell. This will add to magi's resistance from Forms. However, two versions of this spell, or versions of this spell and Parma Magica, do not add their resistances. Only the highest resistance counts.

**Gen:** Sustain or suppress a spell you have cast whose level is less than the level of the Vim spell.

**Gen:** Create a conduit or container for spells with level less than the level of the Vim spell. A conduit puts you in mystical contact with the target (effective Touch range), while a container will hold a spell for a specific length of time before releasing it.

**Gen:** Sustain or suppress a spell cast by another with level less than half the level of the Vim spell.

#### Rego Vim Spells

##### General

###### Aegis of the Hearth

**R:** Spec, **D:** Year, **T:** Bound, **Ritual**

This ritual protects a covenant in the way a Parma Magica protects a magus.

If any spell is cast toward the Aegis (originating from outside it) by any magus who was not involved in the Aegis ritual, the Aegis resists the spell. Furthermore, spells that bring objects into the Aegis, including teleportation spells such as The Seven-League Stride, are also resisted unless the caster was involved in the ritual. If the foreign spell cannot overcome the level of the Aegis + 5 + a stress die, it fizzles out. The Aegis is also able to block foreign Intéllego spells, even if they cannot normally be blocked by a Parma Magica.

Magi who were not involved in the ritual and who cast spells within the Aegis must subtract half the level of the Aegis from all their casting and penetration totals. Spells successfully cast have otherwise normal effects (e.g. Ignem spells still do full damage).

Creatures with a Might score cannot enter the area protected by the Aegis unless they have a higher Might than the Aegis's level. Divine creatures are not affected, but magical, Infernal (including demons), and faerie creatures are. When approaching the border of an Aegis, a magical person (including a Hermetic magus) feels a slight tingle in the extremities. Magical, Infernal, and faerie creatures and persons may be brought within the Aegis, if they are formally invited by one who participated in its casting and given a token to represent the invitation. (The tokens are used during the casting of the ritual, and thus conform to the Law of Sympathy.) Such a person is also not affected by the penalty to casting within the Aegis. The invitation may be withdrawn at any time. This does not require retrieving the token or even notifying the individual who is no longer welcome. Withdrawing an invitation will not expel the person beyond the Aegis, but will prevent them from re-entering after they leave (unless their Might is high enough), and subject them to the casting total penalty while they are within the Aegis. The invitation and expulsion must both be issued by magi who participated in the ritual, but not necessarily by the same magus. A magus may only invite or expel specific, known, individuals. He may not expel someone he does not know has been invited in.

The Aegis is typically cast on the winter solstice, since magical auras can be slightly higher at that time, and the Aegis then lasts for the entire next year. The entire covenant usually participates in the Aegis ritual, which often ends with the participants' walking around the perimeter of the protected area in order to define it. Quite often, the covenant holds a major council meeting, or perhaps a large feast, after the ritual of the Aegis.

Aegis of the Hearth was invented by Notatus, the first Primus of House Bonisagus. It was a major breakthrough, incorporating Mercurian rituals as well as Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was chosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is more powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo requisite. By 1220 Notatus's discoveries have spread, and any magus trained in the Order is capable of inventing versions of the Aegis with the above parameters. Inventing a version with different parameters, however, would require a similar breakthrough, and years of research.

###### Circular Ward Against Demons

**R:** Per, **D:** Ring/Perm, **T:** Circle

**Spell Focus:** Pure Red Coral (+3)

When you set up the ring, the storyguide secretly rolls a quality die + the spell's level - 5. All demons with Infernal Might equal to or less than this total are unable to enter the circle or harm those within it. If you cast the spell again, the second ring dispels the first, regardless of the relative strengths. Some magi cast this spell before going to sleep at night. At night, from certain angles, the ring may be seen as a silver-hued dome.

###### Maintaining the Demanding Spell

**R:** Per, **D:** Diam, **T:** Ind

You cast this spell on a spell that you have already cast and are maintaining through concentration. The spell that requires concentration is then automatically maintained for the duration of this spell, whether you concentrate or not. You cannot change the effects of the first spell without concentrating on it again. For instance, you can use The Unseen Arm (ReTe 5) to hold an object in the air without concentrating, but to move the object still requires concentration. An Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 6+ must be made in order to cast this spell while keeping the first one going (a lower roll than normal because this is what the spell is designed for). This spell only works on spells of equal or lower level.

###### Opening the Intangible Tunnel

**R:** Arc, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

You can open a magical channel from yourself to some target, allowing you to cast any spell with a range greater than Personal on that target. The tunnel does not, of itself, grant any sense impressions of the target—you must cast appropriate spells through it if you wish to see. Spells cast through the tunnel cannot be of higher level than that of this spell - 20. You must make standard Concentration rolls to maintain concentration on the Opening spell as you cast other spells.

A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through The Invisible Eye Revealed or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the spell.

###### Suppressing the Wizard's Handiwork

**R:** Near/Sight, **D:** Conc, **T:** Ind

**Spell Focus:** A Black Onyx (+3)

Cancels one spell that you have cast, but only as long as you concentrate. When concentration is broken the effects of the spell return. The level of the spell to be suppressed must be less than the level of this spell. The effects of the spell being suppressed take about one round to fade out, and then another round to return after concentration is broken. The spell to be affected must be active to be suppressed—in particular, it may not be of Instant duration.

Common uses of this spell include providing access to some place normally blocked by magic (for example, having a permanent MuTe blocking the door to your lab, and then suppressing it to enter), and avoiding traps (such as suppressing a Watching Ward [ReVi Gen] on your rear door). This spell is designed to be held while you do something else, so Concentration rolls are easier than normal (3+ walking, 6+ imminent personal threat).

###### Watching Ward

**R:** Touch, **D:** Spec, **T:** Ind, **Ritual**

Watching Ward puts another spell on a given target on hold until that spell is triggered by a simple condition, which is determined when this ritual is cast. The target of the Watching Ward must be present for the entire casting ritual. When the conditions you specify come to pass, the suspended spell takes effect.

Only one Watching Ward can be placed on any one person or object. The level of the Watching Ward must at least equal the level of the spell held in suspension. You can put multiple spells in the Ward, provided that its level + 10 at least equals the sum of the levels of the contained spells. If Intéllego spells are included in a Watching Ward, they may be used to trigger the other spells. Thus, if you put Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie (InMe 20) into the Watching Ward, you can also put in a spell that is cast when someone lies. An Intéllego spell in the Watching Ward has no effect other than to cast other spells when the proper condition is detected. Thus, in the example, one's breath is not frosty when he or she is caught in a lie.

If someone tries to dispel the Watching Ward and fails, the suspended spell is cast. Flambeau and Tytalus magi commonly put highly destructive spells upon their persons, to be cast if they die so they may have vengeance upon their killers. The Ritual nature of this spell supports the potentially indefinite duration.

A version of this spell with target Room, known as Waiting Spell, is also well known in the Order. It can contain spells up to the level of the Waiting Spell + 5, and is also a Ritual.
