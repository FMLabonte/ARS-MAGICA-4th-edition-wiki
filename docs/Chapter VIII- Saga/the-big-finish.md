## The Big Finish

Be dramatic about the end of a saga. It will likely be the last time the players have a chance to play their characters, so they should feel a satisfying sense of closure. Keep in mind the atmosphere and motif of the saga. If there was a rainstorm at the beginning, describe a lifting storm in the final scene. It reflects the saga's passing and suggests a change from the start, indicating that the characters' lives have had some effect on the world. Even though some may have died in the course of the saga, they're not forgotten.

What separates great sagas from mediocre ones is careful balance. The best dramas make us laugh as well as cry. Your saga does not have to end with the death of all its characters, nor with everyone living happily ever after. Maybe the characters must sacrifice the life of a loved one to save a kingdom, making for a bittersweet conclusion. Think about the endings of your favorite books, movies, and even other campaigns. If you think about why you liked them, you will probably find some clues about how you might present an excellent finale.

Once a saga is complete, take the time to thank everyone for their participation. The fantastic stories you've told have been a group effort. You, as storyguide, painted the scenery, but the heroic deeds of the player characters supplied the rich detail that filled in the foreground.

### Story Ideas

Much of your time between game sessions is probably spent in contemplation of new story ideas. Inspiration can come from many sources, books and movies being quite predominant, but it's important to go beyond them. If you get most of your ideas from a particular film, what happens if everyone in your troupe has seen it as well? Instead, try to make your stories an amalgamation of good ideas, surprising those who think they know where the plot is headed.

What follows are some traditional types of Ars Magica stories. Although these story ideas are not unique by any means, you can tailor them to the needs of your troupe, using them as springboards for your own original stories.

#### Exploration

The exploration of new areas, from enchanted glades to fetid catacombs, offers a great deal of excitement. Exploration gives the members of the troupe an opportunity to broaden their horizons and perhaps boost their reputations. It is a time to introduce new characters to your saga, for new lands mean new acquaintances. You can also use such adventures to expose characters to new customs and fresh ideas.

Rumors and stories usually get characters interested in the journeys they must undergo. Clues planted in musty texts can motivate magi to get out and explore the unknown. They might encounter people that they know little about, or might stumble upon ancient legends just now coming true. The rewards from such adventure can range from physical riches to a wealth of knowledge.

#### Tribunal

Magi, usually no more than three, must travel to a tribunal from time to time to represent their covenant in matters of interest to the entire Order. Tribunal stories are perfect for a large group. You might even invite people to participate who don't normally play, to make the story even more complicated, and to initiate new players to the game.

Everyone should play a magus: those who do not have the role of characters from the players' covenant can represent another. Thus, all players take part and may talk, conspire, befriend, or double-cross to their hearts' content. Make room for people to walk around and talk privately. Emphasize roleplaying and diplomacy over dice rolling and combat. Be sure to present some conflict, though, so characters have something to struggle over.

#### Vis Hunt

Worth far more than simple gold, raw vis is the commodity magi value most highly. Rumors of vis sightings motivate magi to travel to the far reaches of Mythic Europe in order to obtain even scant quantities of the precious substance.

There are endless variations on the standard vis hunt. Magi must determine whether the vis they seek belongs to another covenant, and if so, whether they will risk political problems by taking it anyway. They must sometimes determine how they can get at vis that is well hidden or well protected. And once vis is acquired, the magi of the covenant must determine how it is to be used.

The search for raw vis gets the magi outside the covenant, where they must deal with not only mundane folk, but also mundane problems. You can use the lure of vis to embroil magi in other matters of your own devising, perhaps more dangerous than they originally intended.

#### Mystery

The mystery is a timeless story inspiration. Unlike conventional mysteries, Hermetic whodunits can involve those skilled in the art of magic—a class of person quite difficult to apprehend. Magic used by the culprit can make physical evidence virtually impossible to find. Furthermore, supernatural barriers are bound to hamper characters' progress. These become all the more daunting as they uncover more and more of the truth. If the perpetrator takes refuge in a church, the characters' magical powers will be largely thwarted, and they will have to look to other means.

As in more traditional mysteries, you can create plot twists galore. Remember, when all evidence points to a single person, he is probably innocent. Finally, mysteries can be most disturbing and difficult when the perpetrator is someone the characters trust—like a covenant member or fellow magus.

#### Trouble on the Home Front

Sometimes the story comes to the covenant. Making characters move through their own home, trying to solve a problem or capture an intruder, gives them a better sense of the place where they live. It also keeps them from sleeping so easily in their beds at night.

Trouble at home can range to problems with covenant staff to disagreements with local nobility. It might involve clergy as well, bringing the Dominion and all the problems it represents into the picture. Use your imagination—members of the Order of Hermes have quite a few potential enemies.

#### Faerie Realms

A story involving a faerie realm lets your imagination run wild and makes every scene memorable. Faeries, after all, have little understanding of the "silly" traditions that humans live by. Even where they do understand, they couldn't care less.

Normal rules of reality do not apply while in the faerie realm. Characters may find they can fly when they think happy thoughts, even floating when they giggle. Things might assume a literal aspect: blueberries might make one sad, and spear grass pierce one's feet. Try to keep both characters and players off balance when dealing with faerie lands. No one truly understands these creatures, because they almost never make sense to humans.

Keep in mind that faerie realms are not always cheery and bright. Most of the time a faerie land mimics its surroundings so as not to be recognized. If war and pestilence surround a faerie area, its inhabitants are not likely to welcome visitors.

#### The City Streets

The city is the heart of mundane society and a wide variety of stories can be told within the confines of its walls. Despite their amazing intellect, many magi are ignorant of the ways of normal folk. This is where companions and grogs can shine, taking the lead role in the story.

City adventures usually feature the people who live there in prominent roles. City adventures can be combined with other types of adventures, perhaps with surprising results. What magi would expect to find vis in such a place, for example?

Because the Dominion is ever-present in any good-sized town, magical actions are severely curtailed. That might be a good thing, though, as people tend to unite against strangers who toss fire between their hands. Indeed, the city often proves one of the clergy's greatest weapons against magi of the Order, since in cities, in front of countless witnesses, the Church can condemn wizards and gain the greatest possible support.

### Advanced Storytelling Techniques

Once you've mastered the basics of being a storyguide, you can experiment with techniques and special effects that can add greater depth to a game. Used improperly, though, the ideas presented below can weaken a story, so you should have some experience as a storyguide before attempting them. Some are difficult even for an experienced actor, and must be carefully planned and executed in order to work effectively. If you can pull these stunts off, however, you will create scenes your players will never forget.

#### Flashbacks

Flashbacks occur in movies and television all the time. In a roleplaying game, you can flash back to a scene or scenes in a character's history. You might want to do this to provide clues, to give the players some insight, or to put a different spin on current events.

Flashback scenes and even stories can be played either separately from other stories, or can be intertwined. You can either run short flashbacks, interacting with one character as the other players look on, or you can play flashbacks that the entire covenant is involved with. You can even assign the players roles that they do not normally play, but are important to the back story. You can even specifically design the flashback story to be played as a sort of interlude between the acts of the main story. The two stories can be separated by time or space, but must be somehow connected in theme, mood, or subject, complementing and reflecting each other.

You can also experiment with flashing forward, making your players wonder whether the future is set in stone, or whether what they are seeing is the future at all.

#### Parallel Story

A parallel story is much like a flashback in that it is played out alongside the main story. A parallel story, however, takes place at the same time as the first. At some point the two stories will likely intersect and the characters from each will meet, so you probably don't want to conclude the parallel story until you're near the end of the primary one. It's essential that you time things carefully—and watch out, because your players are unlikely to cooperate.

#### Symbolism

Having something in a story represent something else is an ancient literary technique that can add a great deal of depth and intensity. By judiciously referring to and emphasizing the symbols inherent in a story, you can add power to your themes and make a point or two along the way. Ars Magica holds many symbols, though there is no correct interpretation for any of them.

#### Moods

The moods you try to evoke will dramatically influence how your players react to your stories. Creating emotional ambiance can be taxing, but usually pays off in the end. You should decide beforehand what emotion you hope to evoke in a given scene or story. Possibilities might include horror, wonder, pity, or romance.

To create a given mood, realize that the players will be looking to you, as storyguide, for cues about how they should be acting. If you're acting silly when the scene should be horrific, don't expect your players to behave appropriately. Pursue the chosen mood with intensity; accept no other response. Everything you say and do must reflect the mood you are trying to establish. If you want to evoke drama, discourage your players from joking around.

Appropriate background music, lighting, special effects, and props can all help when you are trying to create a mood. Be creative.
