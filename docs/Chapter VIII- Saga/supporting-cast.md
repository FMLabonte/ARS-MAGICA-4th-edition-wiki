## Supporting Cast

Creating the people who inhabit your world is one of the most enjoyable jobs you have as storyguide. Your characters should be just as alive as the players' characters—to have them fall short of this criterion cheats everyone of a good story.

By no means should you create a separate character sheet for everyone in Mythic Europe. Presumably you have a job and other interests. In general, you should detail individuals that the players' characters interact with on a regular basis. At the very least, you should keep notes on the behavior of important figures, their relevant Personality Traits, and their previous interactions with the characters. Minor characters like covenfolk and minor grogs can have generic statistics. These can become building blocks for personalities if you choose to develop them later.

People who are intrinsic to your saga should be as detailed as the players' characters. These figures include patrons, mentors, and allied magi. Not only does fully developing an important character give you a better idea of his role, it eliminates inconsistencies in portrayal. Players often remember things about your characters that you only mention in passing; you may forget such details, only to be called on later to account for them. By developing these characters, you retain a record of their natures, and can even drop hints that you can act on more fully when you wish.

### The Saga in Play

Actual play is the end that the creation of your saga serves. There are many decisions to be made as the saga progresses. What follows are many points that will help you and your fellows adjudicate the saga as it progresses.

#### The Characters

The first order of saga business is to bring the players' characters together. Examine how each knows the others. There are all sorts of options, from childhood friends, to relatives, to rivals. Likewise, they might simply share a common goal (that ties into the goals of the saga, of course), or find themselves thrown together through some twist of fate.

No matter how it happens, though, there should be a very strong bond between members of the group. Why do they trust one another with their lives? Covenant membership on its own is a valid reason for teamwork, but you should encourage more compelling character interrelations. Characters who are indifferent to the survival of their fellows will not work together to tell great stories, and will most likely bicker and stymie the progress of the saga.

The character creation process should be where bonds are first proposed, and the saga's first session should begin to cement those bonds, as the players start to get used to their new roles. New friendships can also develop over the course of the saga.

#### The March of Time

##### Story Timing

How much time passes in between stories? This is no idle question. Every season that passes is another period of study, practice, and advancement, and every year brings the characters closer to death. Therefore, you need to regulate the amount of time that slips by. If stories occur too close together, magi do not progress far in their Arts and spells, and age may never affect those who begin the saga when young. On the other hand, too wide a separation produces magi who progress too quickly, while companions and grogs rapidly age and deteriorate.

One solution is to set a standard, such as one story per year. Or you could also use a simple die roll to determine the number of seasons that pass between stories. A more complex approach would be to string together several connected adventures one after another, followed by a lull of several seasons or even years. If you have no standard, each storyguide can decide on how much time passes before the next story is played.

Stories should punctuate characters' lives, but also allow them to grow. Remember that few people make their living by adventuring. Adventures are the exceptional activities that happen only once in a long while. Characters must support themselves by other means between stories.

##### Beginnings and Endings

The time immediately before and immediately after a story is important for keeping track of character and covenant progress. A few items should take place before and after each story.

**Before**

- Determine what characters have been doing since the last story. Figure out how much experience they have earned, and what new Abilities they have gained.
- Determine the effects of aging on older characters, if one or more winters have passed since the last story.
- Fill the players in on events that have taken place in the world around their covenant since the last story, especially events that have affected them in major ways.
- Roleplay a council meeting of magi to establish their reactions to events that have occurred between stories, and to set the scene for the story about to begin.

**After**

- Assign experience points earned during the story, and make appropriate adjustments to Personality Traits and Reputations.
- Account for what's happened during the story—characters divide treasure, recover from wounds, and improve the covenant library. Determine what major non-player characters have done or might do in response to the characters' actions.
- Make plans for the covenant's future, based on events of the story. You may want to roleplay another council meeting, where the magi discuss their options and intents.

###### Outside Events

Although the players' characters are without a doubt the centerpiece of your saga, remember that the rest of the world exists largely independent of their influence. There are many other people outside the covenant, and some of them have a tremendous impact on the ongoing saga. Most of them have their own plans that have little to do with the activities of the characters. Time influences people and places everywhere, even when the characters do not witness it. If you set major events into motion "offstage," however, make sure that you consult with any other troupe storyguides who are involved in running stories. This will help you avoid inconsistencies.

###### NPC Roles

While the player characters can have a lot of fun interacting with one another, equal or perhaps greater excitement can be had in dealing with non-player characters. Dealing with them does not mean killing them—simply talking with interesting people, or engaging in politics and intrigue, can prove very rewarding.

##### Creating Roles

Of course, to play good characters, you'll have to create good characters. One of the best ways, and one of the easiest, is to observe the characters of others and emulate them. Short stories, books, magazine articles, television shows, movies, and even the evening news are full to the brim with personalities. You probably won't want to borrow them wholesale, but you'll be surprised at how much you can get away with simply by changing a name.

Of course, the rules for Ars Magica also suggest a wealth of interesting characters. From the house templates for magi to the various virtues and flaws, there are characters that beg to be created and portrayed. Your players can only do so many. You can step in and fill the gaps.

You can tell how well you're portraying your characters with the unknowing assistance of your players. When they talk amongst themselves, in or out of character, the good storyteller's players refer to his different characters as separate entities. If you reach a point where your characters are completely dissociated from your identity, you can perform the vilest of deeds through evil characters, and the players will never blame you for their ill fortune.

### Rewards

Whether the object of a quest or the spoils of a dangerous encounter, rewards are visible proof of the characters' success. Some things, such as books and spells, are valuable only to magi, while others, such as jewelry or magical devices, can compensate companions and grogs for putting their lives on the line. Finding the right balance for your saga is important to your players' satisfaction. Give the characters enough to keep the saga moving, but exercise moderation so that they will keep wanting more.

#### Raw Vis

Raw vis is universally valuable. Magi apply it to a variety of uses and other characters can trade it or have their possessions imbued with it. Raw vis is often found within the bodies of supernatural beings, and sometimes can be harvested from magical plants or other renewable sources. When awarding vis, decide upon the physical characteristics of the source, the Art to which it is attuned, and the number of vis points in it.

Since the availability of raw vis largely determines how rapidly magi grow in power, a saga with too little or too much may have severe problems. The covenant should start with enough raw vis to satisfy basic needs: an average of three to five points per magus per story is about right, depending on how often adventures take place in the progression of years. You can increase or decrease this as you see fit, but remember that too much vis can destroy a saga by making magi ultra-powerful.

#### Treasure

Covenants and characters need money in order to survive and fund projects. Mundane treasure can be one source. Since acquiring money is often of secondary importance to magi, though, it is advisable to concentrate on a treasure's beauty: hoards of gleaming gold; jewelry boxes inlaid with gems; scintillating necklaces; thick bracelets of precious metals; and perhaps even a royal crown. Impress the characters so that they will covet their find instead of rushing to the nearest jeweler for quick cash.

#### Tomes

Magical and scholarly tomes can help a literate character learn Knowledges, spells, Arts, and the techniques for creating magical items. Tomes are therefore extremely valuable, and prized by magi over nearly anything else. Books are very rare; play up their mystery and romance. Make them something to be desired, an item of far greater significance to a magus than the mightiest enchanted sword.

See pages 188-190 for more information on the types of books that exist and how they will aid the magi of your covenant in their learning.

#### Magical Artifacts

During their expeditions, magi often find mystical devices. Some are constructed by fellow magi, others created by dwarfs, gnomes, elves, demons, faeries or other mystical beings. In legends, magical items are things of great beauty—awe-inspiring to say the least. They are powerful objects, not crackerjack gadgets. Peppering your saga with miscellaneous items cheapens the grandeur of these awesome creations. One way to avoid this is to award predominantly one-use items like potions and powders. Another is to strictly limit the number of truly powerful artifacts. Make the characters work hard to earn such things.

A good deal of entertainment can be had from a character's attempts to learn how an artifact works. Some have obvious powers, such as a cape that makes the wearer invisible. Others are more obscure, and discovering their abilities requires intense research in the laboratory. An effective combination involves some that are obvious and others that are hidden. Investing humble-looking items with fantastic power can be the basis for exciting stories. After all, the Holy Grail itself was not that magnificent in appearance. [See page 90](../page-refs/page-90.md) for information about investigating enchantments on items.

The inset describes some example artifacts, ranging from the fairly simple to the awesomely powerful. You can use these as models for magic items in your saga. Each item description is followed by a number in parentheses, which indicates the target number for investigating its properties in the laboratory.

### The Big Finish

Eventually, the saga will come to an end. With any luck, it is one that you planned for and one where the covenant members achieve their goals.
