# Magical Training
Magi spend 15 years in apprenticeship learning the theory and practice of Hermetic magic. This includes the use of the fifteen magical Arts and many formulaic spells. During this step, you will purchase a rating in each Art and will choose a list of formulaic spells your character knows.

Before you begin this step, it might be helpful to think about what sort of spellcaster your magus is. Did he specialize in one or two Arts during his apprenticeship? Did he learn many spells of moderate power, or only a few of great magnitude? You should make sure you have at least some understanding of the magic system before you make these decisions, because a poor decision now can seriously curtail your potential for development in the future.

## Magical Arts
Each magus has a score in each of the 15 magical Arts (though a given rating could be 0). Each Art is described in detail in the Magic section beginning on [page 65](../page-refs/page-65.md). Again, it is highly recommended that you are familiar with that section before you create a magus character.

You purchase Art scores the same way that you buy Abilities, spending a certain number of points to purchase a given score. You are allowed 150 points to divide amongst the Arts, though certain Virtues and Flaws may increase or decrease this value. The cost to purchase a given Art score from a base of 0 is listed in the Art Score Cost Table.

## Spells
Magus characters fresh from apprenticeship start with no more than 150 levels of formulaic spells, unless a Virtue or Flaw changes that total. Spells of a level higher than your Technique + Form + Intelligence + 10 cannot be initially known. (The Technique and Form are those of the spell in question.) Spells above that level are too difficult to learn at this point.

Many common formulaic spells are described in the Spells chapter—you are free to select any of them to fill out your initial allotment. This list is by no means exhaustive, however. With the permission of the storyguide, you may begin the game with spells of your own devising. You should determine the level of such spells according to the normal guidelines (see “Inventing Spells,” pp. 80-82).

## Wizard’s Sigil
You should select your character’s sigil—the special feature that manifests itself when he casts spells. Sigils never have concrete mechanical effects like causing more damage or making spells more effective. Rather, they are secondary manifestations that allow for roleplaying. Examples might

- **Specialist:** 16, 4, 2, 1
- **Dual Art:** 12, 11, 3
- **Concentrated:** 10, 10, 8, 2, 1
- **Widely Adept:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4
- **Generalist:** 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1

### Wizard’s Sigil
include special scents that are produced when the character works magic, specific colors that are produced in spells, strange or enchanting noises that occur when magic is worked, and the like. The sigil you choose holds true across all types of magic, so a character whose sigil was the scent of brimstone would produce that effect whether casting *Ball of Abysmal Flame* or *Soothe Pains of the Beast*.
