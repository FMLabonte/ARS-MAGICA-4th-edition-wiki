# Magical Training
Magi spend 15 years in apprenticeship learning the theory and practice of Hermetic magic. This includes the use of the fifteen magical Arts and many formulaic spells. During this step, you will purchase a rating in each Art and will choose a list of formulaic spells your character knows.

Before you begin this step, it might be helpful to think about what sort of spellcaster your magus is. Did he specialize in one or two Arts during his apprenticeship? Did he learn many spells of moderate power, or only a few of great magnitude? You should make sure you have at least some understanding of the magic system before you make these decisions, because a poor decision now can seriously curtail your potential for development in the future.

## Magical Arts
Each magus has a score in each of the 15 magical Arts (though a given rating could be 0). Each Art is described in detail in the Magic section beginning on [page 65](../page-refs/page-65.md). Again, it is highly recommended that you are familiar with that section before you create a magus character.

You purchase Art scores the same way that you buy Abilities, spending a certain number of points to purchase a given score. You are allowed 150 points to divide amongst the Arts, though certain Virtues and Flaws may increase or decrease this value. The cost to purchase a given Art score from a base of 0 is listed in the Art Score Cost Table.

## Spells
Magus characters fresh from apprenticeship start with no more than 150 levels of formulaic spells, unless a Virtue or Flaw changes that total. Spells of a level higher than your Technique + Form + Intelligence + 10 cannot be initially known. (The Technique and Form are those of the spell in question.) Spells above that level are too difficult to learn at this point.

Many common formulaic spells are described in the Spells chapter—you are free to select any of them to fill out your initial allotment. This list is by no means exhaustive, however. With the permission of the storyguide, you may begin the game with spells of your own devising. You should determine the level of such spells according to the normal guidelines (see “Inventing Spells,” pp. 80-82).

## Wizard’s Sigil
You should select your character’s sigil—the special feature that manifests itself when he casts spells. Sigils never have concrete mechanical effects like causing more damage or making spells more effective. Rather, they are secondary manifestations that allow for roleplaying. Examples might

### Example Art Scores
Purchasing Art scores can be complicated—there are many possible combinations. Some common choices are listed below.

- **Specialist:** 16, 4, 2, 1
- **Dual Art:** 12, 11, 3
- **Concentrated:** 10, 10, 8, 2, 1
- **Widely Adept:** 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4
- **Generalist:** 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1

### Wizard’s Sigil
include special scents that are produced when the character works magic, specific colors that are produced in spells, strange or enchanting noises that occur when magic is worked, and the like. The sigil you choose holds true across all types of magic, so a character whose sigil was the scent of brimstone would produce that effect whether casting *Ball of Abysmal Flame* or *Soothe Pains of the Beast*.

## Finishing Touches

### Reputation
Reputations describe how others expect your character to behave, and affects how they act towards him. Unless a Virtue or Flaw gives your character a Reputation, he has none at the beginning of the game. If your character does have a Reputation before play begins, you will decide on an appropriate type and assign it a score that you feel best describes it.

Reputations are recorded as a word or brief descriptive phrase, a numerical level, and a target group, for example *"Fearless 3, among the grogs of the covenant."* The word or phrase simply describes the type of reputation. The level ranges from 1 to 10 (with 5 being a practical maximum) and reflects the intensity of the character's fame (or infamy).

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

The group tells who knows of the Reputation. Sometimes, descriptions will refer to a "good" or "bad" reputation. This should be loosely interpreted—there is no absolute list of reputations divided into good and bad. Use common sense and your storyguide's assistance, if need be.

For information on how Reputations function in play, how you can gain and lose Reputations, and how far your Reputation may precede you, refer to the *"Reputation"* section of the Storyguide chapter on [page 191](../page-refs/page-191.md).

<!-- new [page 61](../page-refs/page-61.md) -->
### Personality Traits
In *Ars Magica* your character's nature is translated into game mechanics called **Personality Traits** that describe his inclinations and predilections. These are recorded as brief descriptions with numerical scores, such as *Brave +2*. The score may be positive or negative, indicating a strong sympathy or antipathy to the stated quality. You cannot normally have a score of more than +3 or less than -3, unless a Virtue or Flaw allows otherwise.

Personality Traits serve two major functions. First of all, they provide a concrete description of how a given character is likely to act. In this capacity, they can be used to randomly determine a character's reaction to a given situation. (But note that a character is never required to determine how he acts based on the results of a roll.) Secondly, they serve as a sort of shorthand that describes a character's personality. In troupe-style roleplaying, each player may play the role of several different characters over the course of a saga. Personality Traits serve to remind the player what a given character is like each time he assumes a new role.

When assigning Personality Traits, you should think about how they arise from your character's background, upbringing, and life experience. You can take as many or as few personality traits as you would like, and assign each any value that you feel is appropriate. It's best to choose no more than five, with only one or two extreme values. Otherwise you run the risk of creating a caricature rather than a believable person.

Sometimes Personality Traits result in conflicts between your motives and those of the troupe. That's something you will have to work out—hopefully not at the expense of your character's identity, or the unity of your gaming group.

### Quirks
You may want to give your character interesting personal details that add depth and charm, such as a twisted sense of humor, a fondness for animals, or a habit of grunting yes to a question. Write a short paragraph or make a list of the strange and unique things that define your character.

### Personal History
This is where you spell out your character's family connections, the area where he grew up, and any old enemies or friends. You should also specify how your character became linked to the covenant and maintains relations with it. All of this information and anything else that you think is important about your character should be recorded both to help you remember it and so that the storyguide can refer to it if necessary.

If you're not familiar with Mythic Europe, you can work on your character's history with members of your troupe who are more versed in the world. Alternatively, you can designate some geographical area as your responsibility and have your character originate there. In general, though, don't worry if you deviate a little from the Mythic Europe that is spelled out in this book and in *Ars Magica*'s supplements. This is a game, not a history class—do what feels right and have fun.

### Appearance
Your character's appearance makes his nature visible to others. It can be based on ethnic origin, characteristics (particularly Presence), background, Virtues and Flaws, and Personality Traits. A detailed description can make your character more tangible and interesting.

### Confidence
Each character begins the game with three Confidence points. These are used when your character is in rough situations when sheer willpower might enable him to prevail. [See page 192](../page-refs/page-192.md) for information on exactly how Confidence points are used during game play.

### Size
Every creature and person in *Ars Magica* has a Size rating. Generally, Size is more important for comparisons between creatures of different species than of the same species. Average Size is 0, that of a normal adult human. Unless a Virtue or Flaw directs you otherwise, your character's Size is 0.

Size determines the number of Fatigue levels and Body levels your character has (see *"Health and Fatigue,"* below). Its score is also added to Soak (used to absorb damage) and is subtracted from Defense totals (for avoiding blows in combat). Size can also, at the storyguide's discretion, influence rolls for Abilities such as Stealth and Intimidation.

<!-- new [page 62](../page-refs/page-62.md) -->
### Health and Fatigue
The average adult human of Size 0 has six Body levels (*Unhurt, Hurt, Light Wounds, Medium Wounds, Heavy Wounds,* and *Incapacitated*) and six Fatigue levels (*Fresh, Winded, Weary, Tired, Dazed,* and *Unconscious*) that describe his possible conditions. You may have additional levels if your size is some number other than zero. Characters of Size +1 usually have an extra *Hurt* Body level and an extra *Winded* Fatigue level. Characters of Size -1 lose those Body and Fatigue levels entirely. For information on how Health and Fatigue function in game terms, refer to [page 177](../page-refs/page-177.md).

### Equipment
You must decide what possessions your character has. This equipment is limited by the resources of the covenant, unless a character has a Virtue or Flaw that allows her to have more expensive equipment. The covenant almost always provides its members' mundane supplies (such as rations, basic clothing, and the like), but you should keep track of personal items, such as fine clothes and writing equipment.

In general, grogs are restricted to standard armaments and armor unless the covenant has exceptionally well- or ill-armed guards. Companions are similarly restricted, but their backgrounds are more likely to allow for better equipment.

Magi have special equipment requirements, not only in terms of magical paraphernalia but also their dress, since they can expect fair and respectful treatment even from enemies. Wearing magical symbols on one's cloak will usually advertise a wizard's status, though it also makes it difficult to travel without being noticed. Dressing in finery will afford some respect, but people who do not recognize the danger may still attempt to assault or harass your character. Peasant garb merits no special treatment. Wearing armor is a bad idea—enemies may mistake the character for a warrior and offer challenge.

Magi begin the game with the laboratory equipment stipulated by their covenant and with any sort of garb that they wish. They may also choose standard weaponry (or better, depending on the covenant's resources) if they are skilled in its use.

Use your common sense in picking out mundane belongings for your character. Take into account such things as your character's background and means. When you have assembled a list, present it to your storyguide for approval.

### Encumbrance
Encumbrance is a measure of how loaded down a character is. Its score acts as a penalty to all rolls that require free, fast movement, including spellcasting and nearly all Quickness rolls.

Your Encumbrance is equal to your Strength + Load. Load is calculated by adding together the Load values of your weapons, armor, and other bulky equipment (and dropping fractions). Note that Load values are negative.

Your Encumbrance score cannot be greater than 0, nor can it be negative if you are carrying no Load, no matter how low your Strength is.

### Calculated Combat Values
If your character is likely to get involved in combat, it would be worth your while to calculate your character's combat values at this stage. Refer to the Combat chapter, specifically *"Introduction to Combat Scores,"* on [page 161](../page-refs/page-161.md).

### Moving On
The process of character creation does not end with the beginning of the saga. Your character never stops growing, changing, developing and maturing. As the saga unfolds, think of ways your character's personality has changed or is changing—guide his growth over time. The experience points you earn as time passes will move your character's Abilities to new levels. You can make up new Personality Traits, quirks and history to further define your character's personality and background.

Novelists often speak of characters in their books coming to life, refusing to be manipulated or directed by the writer. They stand out from the page and say, *"Leave me alone. I'm real."* Then they do exactly as they wish, regardless of the author's original intent. We roleplayers can learn a lot from this experience.
