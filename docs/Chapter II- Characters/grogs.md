# Grogs

When you design your covenant you will create many grogs in order to flesh out its inhabitants. Some take part in story after story, acquiring quirks as they acquire scars. Other are simply background characters, only becoming more fully developed if they enter a story.

Inexperienced players may see grogs' limited role in the group as a restriction on their roleplaying potential. To avoid this problem, you should think of grogs as the vibrant lower-class characters found in many Shakespearean plays. Their lives are often insignificant compared to those of the major figures, but their actions often reflect upon or even direct the basic themes and plot of the play. Yes, grogs are peripheral characters, but they're still a lot of fun to roleplay, just as Shakespeare's servants and guttersnipes are enjoyable to watch.

The key to successfully portraying grogs is to emphasize the extremes. Just as they work and live hard, they play hard—drinking is a favorite pastime for all medieval folk. They live menial lives, so often complain about their fate. Grogs tend to be the intellectual inferiors of the covenant and thus make excellent foils and straight men.

As with companions, several sample grog vocations are listed here. Like companions, each has a list of suggested Abilities. Remember that they are suggestions only. You can select whatever you want when the time comes to list your Abilities and their scores. In addition to the Abilities that you select, every grog automatically begins with the Abilities Brawl 1, Carouse 1, and Speak Own Language 4. As with companions, you may depart entirely from these vocations and build from the ground up.

When it comes time to select Virtues and Flaws, each grog must be given one of the Virtues or Flaws from the Grog Background section of the Virtues and Flaws section.

### Archer

You are a custos. Your traveling companions look to you for backup and expect you to be vigilant for surprise attacks when they are locked in combat. When the turb goes into action you are often positioned at the rear to shoot at the enemy. You can also be called upon to kill a target, like the leader of a group of bandits, before melee commences. If your eye fails you, you commit your friends to a battle in which they lack the advantage.

**Archer Abilities:** Awareness, Climb, Stealth, one or more Weapon Classes (including Bows).

### Beggar

You came to the covenant intending to beg from its inhabitants. Living outside its walls with some of your associates, you soon found you could slip into the covenant to steal what you wanted. Before long one of the magi came out and invited you to stay and pay for what you had taken. What choice did you have? Now you live with the turb, but still find it difficult to do an honest day's work. You've perfected the art of looking busy.

**Beggar Abilities:** Area Lore, Awareness, Folk Ken, Guile, Stealth, one or more Weapon Classes.

### Cook

Your talents may not always be appreciated, but covenfolk quickly praise your name after a grueling day's work, when good food is their only solace. Sometimes your talents are called for when members of the covenant travel. On the road, morale can rest solely on a hot meal, so magi look to you to keep the others happy. However, when supplies are short, your stern demeanor puts down troublesome belly-achers.

**Cook Abilities:** Craft (Cooking), Folk Ken, one or more Weapon Classes.

### Point Guard

You're the bruiser of your turb. You are a custos, and everyone knows it. When a fight is brewing, you lead the way, hacking through any barriers that stand between you and the foe. If that means assaulting a castle's front gate, so be it; at least you're outfitted with heavy armor. Your fellow grogs admire you, but certainly don't want to take your place.

**Point Guard Abilities:** Athletics, Awareness, several Weapon Classes.

### Scout

You are invaluable to your traveling companions—they rely on you to pick the safest route through harsh terrain and to spot the enemy before being spotted. You must estimate the threat posed by an enemy and communicate that information to your superiors. If you do your job well, you usually earn first dibs on any spoils, as well as the thanks of all your companions.

**Scout Abilities:** Area Lore, Awareness, Climb, Folk Ken, Hunt, Stealth, one or more Weapon Classes.

### Sentry

Whether it be punishment, recognition of your perceptive eye, or your ability to resist sleep, you usually find yourself on guard duty. At the covenant, that means patrolling the walls or standing outside a locked door. Abroad, it means watching over your traveling companions while they sleep. You've learned to appreciate sentry duty. It leaves you time to yourself and it's taught you independence. Though you may not be a custos yet, you may soon rise to that rank when you save some slumbering magus's hide.

**Sentry Abilities:** Awareness, Folk Ken, one or more Weapon Classes.

### Servant

You are the personal attendant to one of the more important inhabitants of the covenant: a knight's page, a magus's butler, or a lady's reeve. Though your position is ostensibly subservient, you live well, receiving food, shelter, and a warm bed. However, if your employer is prone to travel, you find yourself on the road as well, and constantly in danger. A silent observer of the upper classes, you've picked up many of their secrets and can use them for your own ends.

**Servant Abilities:** Animal Handling, Chirurgy, Etiquette, Folk Ken, Guile, Intrigue, Ride.

### Shield Grog

You are one of the most trusted and loyal custodes in the covenant, entrusted with protecting a magus in combat. You travel with and constantly remain close to your charge, whom you are sworn to protect—even sacrificing yourself if necessary. As the magus relies so heavily on you, a bond born of need has developed between the two of you; social standing is quickly overlooked when one's life is at stake. Because of this relationship, you have the magus's attention, and may receive special treatment.

**Shield Grog Abilities:** Awareness, Folk Ken, one or more Weapon Classes (including Shield & Weapon).

### Stablehand

This task was probably foisted upon you at a young age to keep you out from underfoot. However, as you grew you learned to appreciate the job. It provides you with a roof, a soft bed, and companions who appreciate your efforts. You're not custos, but the warriors of the covenant usually treat you well, for they value the work you perform.

**Stablehand Abilities:** Animal Handling, Ride, one or more Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

### Turb Sergeant

Only a handful of grogs have your status. You are responsible for several grogs, usually ensuring that they stay alert on guard and sober on duty. You earn considerable respect from underlings and superiors alike, so you sleep in your own quarters, eat good food, and are often recruited for missions abroad. However, you ultimately share responsibility for the actions of your troops, so you are punished and rewarded as they are.
