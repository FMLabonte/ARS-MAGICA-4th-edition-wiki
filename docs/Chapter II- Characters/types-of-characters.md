# Types of Characters

There are three different types of characters in Ars Magica: magi, companions, and grogs. They are not "character classes" such as you might find in other games, but three broad character categories. Each has a unique role in the saga and a certain degree of power. Slightly different rules apply to each, though the basic concepts are the same.

Generally, each player creates a magus, a companion, and one or more grogs. In the troupe style of play, you will switch between playing your magus and companion as needed throughout the saga. Your grogs, on the other hand, usually take part in each story. Grogs tend to be needed in considerable numbers, so magi and companions who are abroad keep a group of them, called a turb (from a Latin word meaning "mob"), in retainer.

## Magi

Magi are the primary focus of the game, which is designed to emulate all the mythic spellcasting possibilities we see in films and read in novels—possibilities that are often given short shrift in other roleplaying systems. Magi therefore have immense magical ability, even as beginning characters, which makes them very powerful. Magi in Ars Magica aren't artificially weakened for the sake of arbitrary "character balance."

With great power comes great responsibility. Magi are very demanding characters to play, particularly because others look to them for salvation from dire threats. They are the leaders of the covenant, so when they go abroad with an entourage, they must take responsibility for the fates of all. If a magus is not decisive and practical, he might have to contend with a revolt.

Magi tend to be deficient in basic social skills that are necessary to survive. Ironically, their mystic powers only compound their inability to deal with the mundane world. The Gift of magic, though precious, makes people and animals around magi ill at ease. Because of this, all rolls that magi make to make a good impression on or inspire the trust of mundane people or animals suffer a –3 penalty. Though magi seem superior to other character types, they still rely heavily on the support of companions and grogs.

## Companions

A few exceptional and highly skilled people, called companions, are also associated with the covenant. Some work and live there, acquiring the rank of consortes (kahn-SOR-tays, singular consors: "cohort"). Others are friends of the magi and visit only occasionally. Their motivations in dealing with the covenant vary—this is something you will have to consider when creating a companion.

Companions provide any skills that the magi, in their pursuit of arcane knowledge, have not had the time or inclination to learn. They provide a connection between the esoteric covenant and the mundane world around it, since magi often do not mix well with society. The broad term "companion" can include scholars, foresters, sages, healers, thieves, spies, leaders of grogs, and almost any other profession that you come up with and that the storyguide approves.

## Grogs

Grogs are the henchmen of the covenant, and can be guards, servants, messengers, cooks, carpenters or individuals of any other mundane profession. Essentially, they include all the people who help keep the covenant going but are not central to the saga. Each player makes several grogs, but once created, all grogs are played in common by the troupe. It is common for a given player to play one or more grogs in each story, alongside his magus or companion.

"Grog" is a slang term that has spread throughout the Order, mainly because grogs themselves use it. Elite grogs are called custodes (koos-TOH-days, singular custos: "guardian"), the name magi give to warriors and servants who journey with and protect them. More common grogs simply perform mundane duties at the covenant, rarely straying from its walls. Often, these most mundane of grogs are simply referred to as covenfolk, especially if they are non-combatants.
