# Virtues and Flaws

Since magi, companions, and grogs are exceptional people, they have many unusual strengths and weaknesses. Normal people, on the other hand, may have only one of each, or none at all. Properly selecting a range of interesting features is central to developing your character concept, so think carefully about your decisions.

Virtues are exceptional attributes that confer a benefit; Flaws are attributes that hinder or limit characters. Once play begins, they cannot change unless the storyguide decides that drastic story events warrant some sort of modification. Virtues are each assigned a positive value, and Flaws a negative value, the size of the number indicating how much they affect your character. The only way to get Virtues is to take Flaws. Every Flaw you accept for your character has a negative point score, which you may balance with the equivalent number of points in Virtues. You may spend these points as you please, choosing several low-cost Virtues or a few with a high cost. Some Virtues and Flaws have variable costs, depending on the intensity of the effect.

Magi and companions may spend up to ten points on Virtues and ten points on Flaws. Grogs may spend up to three points on Virtues and three points on Flaws. The only restriction is that the total value of Virtues and Flaws for each character must be the same, in order to balance their effects. At the option of the storyguide, a character can be allowed to purchase more points worth of Flaws than Virtues, but in no case may the limit based on character type be exceeded.

Virtues and Flaws that are directly contradictory, or that deal with the same aspect of your character, are mutually exclusive—you may not buy both. Some Flaws are twisted forms of Virtues, in which case they also cancel one another out and are again not allowed. Virtues which provide bonuses on the same activity or statistic are not cumulative. The combination simply gives the bonus that the greatest gives alone. Consult the storyguide if you are unsure how two of your Virtues or Flaws might affect one another.

Sometimes you may take more than one Virtue or Flaw relating to a particular aspect of your character. This is perfectly allowable. Virtues and Flaws that somehow work against one another can create an interesting inner struggle, such as Compulsion to drink, which can conflict with being Dutybound.

Virtues and Flaws are not gained after character generation. In some cases, characters might gain abilities or status that resembles Virtues or Flaws described here, but these should not be recorded as additional Virtues or Flaws. In no case must these new effects be balanced with other Virtues or Flaws. If your character gains the status of a noble (similar to some of the Companion Social Class Virtues) through game play, for example, you need not select a new Flaw to counterbalance this gain.

Virtues and Flaws are listed below, each with a short description of its effect, from the character's point of view.

## Hermetic Virtues and Flaws

### Variable Virtues

**Cyclic Magic** (positive): Your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature (solar, lunar, or seasonal, for example) and as such, is more potent at specific times. At those times, you receive a bonus to all spell rolls and Lab Totals. The cycle of your magic must be regular and approved by the storyguide. Furthermore, the length of time when the bonus applies must be equal to the amount of time when it does not. This Virtue costs two points for each +3 bonus you receive at the peak of the cycle.

**Follower of Bjornaer**: Available only to magi who are members of House Bjornaer. [See page 21](../page-refs/page-21.md).

**Magical Affinity**: You are attuned to a specific kind of magic. This gives you a special Arcane Talent, Affinity with (Subject), at an initial score of 1. You may add your Affinity score to all spell rolls and Lab Totals involving that kind of magic. You may increase this rating just as you increase other Talents—by spending experience points. The cost of this Virtue depends on the kind of magic the Affinity applies to. +1 Magical Affinities are narrow or uncommon magical circumstances: demons, water creatures, ghosts and corpses, and self-transformation are examples. +2 Magical Affinities are more common or useful: healing, forests and forest animals, faerie, and rock are examples. +3 Magical Affinities can cover an entire Form—Terram or Mentem, for example. +4 Magical Affinities can apply to an entire Technique, such as Creo or Muto. The storyguide is the final arbiter of the cost of a proposed Magical Affinity.

**Method Caster**: You are excellent at formulaic spells, as you have perfected a consistent and precise method for casting them. For every point invested in this Virtue, you gain a +1 bonus to any formulaic spell you cast. However, if you vary at all from your precise method (by altering your gestures or voicing), you do not get this bonus.

### +1 Virtues

**Adept Student**: You digest the instruction of others quite easily. You get a +6 bonus to Lab Totals when learning spells or when working from the lab texts of others.

**Deft Art**: You are particularly skilled with one Art. You suffer only half the normal penalty for casting spells in that Art under unusual circumstances and when using non-standard voicings/gestures.

**Extra Arts**: You start with 10 extra points to purchase Magical Arts. This Virtue may be taken more than once.

**Extra Spells**: You start with 10 extra levels of spells. This Virtue may be taken more than once.

**Faerie Magic** (Merinita only): [See page 25](../page-refs/page-25.md). This Virtue can be made available to magi of other houses at the option of the troupe or storyguide.

**Fast Caster**: Your magic takes less time to perform than that of other magi. You gain +3 in engagement contests when casting spells.

**Free Study**: You are better at figuring things out for yourself than you are at poring over books. Add +1 to rolls when studying from raw vis (before multiplication).

**Gentle Gift**: Unlike other magi, whose Magical nature disturbs normal people and animals, your Gift is subtle and quiet. You do not suffer the usual penalties on rolls for interacting with people and animals.

**Hermetic Prestige**: Because of something in your background, other magi look up to you even if you haven't earned their respect. Some envy you, and most will certainly expect more from you than from others. You gain a Reputation of level 3 within the Order.

**Inventive Genius**: Invention comes naturally to you. You receive +3 on Lab Totals when you invent new spells, craft magic items, and make potions. If you experiment, you get +6.

**Mastered Spells**: You have 10 experience points to use in mastering spells. [See page 75](../page-refs/page-75.md) for details on mastered spells. You may take this Virtue more than once.

**Quaesitor**: You are a judge of the Order of Hermes. You are respected, if not necessarily liked, by other members of the Order. Your office involves specific duties and responsibilities, and you start with an appropriate Reputation of level 3 within the Order. Beginning magi will very rarely have this Virtue unless they are members of House Guernicus (commonly called House Quaesitor).

**Secret Vis Source**: You have a secret or personal supply of vis (raw magical energy) that you alone can use. You gain one pawn of vis per season (four pawns a year); the source and type is determined in consultation with the storyguide. You do not start with any of this vis, though, having spent it or just discovered how to get it. Depending on the general availability of vis in a given Saga, the storyguide may want to adjust the value of this Virtue.

**Special Circumstances**: You are able to perform magic better in certain uncommon situations (such as during a storm or while touching the target), gaining a +3 bonus to your rolls to cast or resist spells.

**Strong Writer**: You write about magic with great speed and enthusiasm. You copy spells from your shorthand at (Scribe Latin x 40) levels per season, and copy (Scribe Latin x 90) levels of spells that have already been written out per season. All summae, libri quaestionum, and tractatus you write have a +3 Quality. When writing summae, you accumulate two more levels per season than normal. You copy summae at (Scribe + Dexterity) x 4 levels per season.

<!-- new [page 40](../page-refs/page-40.md) -->
### +2 Virtues

**Cautious Sorcerer**: You are very careful with magic, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail. You roll one less botch die (minimum roll of one die) when casting spells (either spontaneous or formulaic), and when working in the laboratory.

**Quiet Magic**: You can cast spells using only a soft voice at no penalty, and at only a -5 penalty if you do not speak at all. You gain no benefits from using your voice normally or using a booming voice.

**Side Effect**: Your magic has some incidental feature that is generally useful, though occasionally annoying. The intensity of the side effect increases with the level of the spell. Examples include a commanding presence when casting that translates into a temporary +1 Presence bonus for a short time after casting, or a calm state of mind derived from casting which allows a bonus on Concentration rolls for a short time after casting.

**Student of Faerie**: You have been trained in the various rites and observances of faerie magic. You receive a +3 modifier to rolls involving Faerie Lore, and are considered to have the Common Sense Virtue ([see page 41](../page-refs/page-41.md)) when dealing with faeries.

**Subtle Magic**: You may cast spells without using gestures at no penalty. You gain no benefits from using normal gestures.

<!-- new [page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md) -->
### +3 Virtues

**Enduring Magic**: The effects of your spells tend to last longer than usual (though Instant and Permanent spells remain just that). The storyguide secretly rolls a simple die; the number rolled is a multiple to the spell's normal duration.

**Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic**: You can do more with spontaneous magic than most magi at the cost of your own life energy. When you decide to exert yourself in casting a spontaneous spell, you declare the level of effect you wish to produce before rolling. Make your casting roll as normal, adding all the appropriate modifiers and dividing by two. If your result is higher than the level you declared, you spend only one Fatigue Level as usual. If your result is less than the level you declared, you must expend one Body level per five points (or fraction thereof) you missed the target level by. The spell then succeeds as normal, provided that you are still conscious. Running out of Body levels has the normal effect—it is quite possible to kill yourself if you botch badly or attempt to cast very high level spells.

### +5 Virtues

**Elementalist**: You were trained in the Elementalist tradition, which has been adopted into Hermetic Theory but has never truly been absorbed. As such, you are very proficient in working with any of the natural elements of air, earth, fire, and water. You automatically gain Affinity with Elements ([see page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md)), which applies to all rolls involving Auram, Aquam, Ignem, and Terram. Due to your exotic training, however, your ties to Hermetic magic are weak. You have a Major Magic Deficiency in the Form of Vim ([see page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md)), and all rolls to cast formulaic spells that don't deal with the elements are at a penalty equal to your Affinity with Elements score. Furthermore, you are unable to cast any ritual spells, save those that specifically and concretely involve elements. This Virtue prevents you from having any other Magical Affinities.

**Silent Magic**: You may cast spells without speaking, at no penalty. You do not benefit from using your normal voice.

<!-- new [page 46](../page-refs/page-46.md) -->
### Variable Flaws

**Cyclic Magic** (negative): As with the variable Hermetic Virtue, your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature and is less potent at specific times. This Flaw yields two points for each -3 penalty to spell-casting rolls at the peak of the cycle. The length of time during which you are at a disadvantage must be equal to the time when there is no penalty.

**Deleterious Circumstances**: Your magic is restricted in certain situations. Total the cost for the commonality of the occurrence with the crippling effect it produces to determine the cost of this Flaw. You may take this flaw more than once.

**Situation:**

- **Common (-1)**: This effect takes place in relatively common circumstances. Examples include when in village of more than 200, when touching the ground, or during daylight.
- **Uncommon (0)**: The effect harms you in uncommon circumstances. Examples include when casting on wild animals or when sitting.

**Restriction:**

- **Minor (-1)**: Your magic rolls (spellcasting rolls and Lab Totals) are at -3 when in the situation.
- **Major (-2)**: Your magic totals (spellcasting rolls and Lab Totals) are halved when in the situation.
- **Total (-3)**: Your magic does not work at all when this condition is in effect.

**Magical Deficiency**: You have trouble casting a particular type of magic. Total the cost for the Art you have problems with and the penalty you receive to find the total cost of this Flaw.

**Art:**

- **Uncommon Form (0)**: Any Form save Corpus or Vim
- **Common Form (-1)**: Corpus or Vim
- **Technique (-2)**: Any Technique

**Effect:**

- **Minor (-1)**: The level of the Art is divided in half when used for any purpose other than studying that Art.
- **Major (-2)**: Any total that includes that Art (spellcasting rolls and Lab Totals, for example) is halved.

**Poor Formulaic Magic**: You are simply not very good at formulaic magic. Subtract the chosen cost of this Flaw from every roll that you make to cast formulaic spells.

### -1 Flaws

**Blatant Gift**: People immediately realize that there is something strange about you, even if they do not know you are a magus. Animals are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by your presence. You suffer a -6 penalty on all interaction rolls with normal people and animals.

**Creative Block**: You have problems creating new things in the lab. You receive -3 on Lab Totals when you invent new spells, craft magic items, and make potions, unless you are working from a lab text. If you experiment, rolls twice as many dice on the experimentation table.

**Disjointed Magic**: You cannot use previous knowledge to help you with magic. You gain no benefit from knowing a spell that is similar to one you are learning or inventing, and you gain no enchantment bonuses from Techniques and Forms already invested in an item.

**Flawed Parma Magica**: Your Parma Magica (a ritual of protection against spells) is defective and provides only half the normal magic resistance against a certain Form. You may purchase this Flaw more than once for different Forms.

**Follower of Verditius** (Verditius only): [See page 26](../page-refs/page-26.md).

**Hedge Wizard**: Because of your esoteric magic, other magi distrust you, and more importantly, grant you no respect. You start with a negative Reputation within the Order of Hermes at level 3 as a hedge wizard, even though you are a member of the Order.

**Incompatible Arts**: For some reason you are completely unable to use one or more combinations of Techniques and Forms (except for Vim and Corpus). This Flaw may be taken repeatedly with different combinations, but may not be combined with a Deficiency ([see page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md)).

<!-- End of page-31-35.md -->


<!-- Start of page-36-40.md -->

**Incomprehensible**: You have an eccentric understanding of magic which you are almost completely unable to describe. Your rolls are at –3 when discussing or writing about magic (assuming that you are trying to communicate clearly).

**Infamous Master**: Your master was a diabolist, bumbler, fool, widely despised, or held in contempt for some other reason. Most magi expect little better from you. Even if you've done nothing wrong, you are treated as though you don't deserve to be a member of the Order. You have a bad Reputation of the appropriate type at level 3 among magi.

**Loose Magic**: You lack the concentration, will, or ability to Master spells.

**Necessary Condition**: In order for your magic to work, you must perform a specific action while casting any spell. This should be something simple, such as singing or spinning around three times.

**No Familiar (Bjornaer Only)**: Because of a flaw in your magic or nature, it is impossible for you to create the mystic cords that bind you to a familiar. Magi of houses other than Bjornaer may take this Flaw with the permission of the Storyguide.

**No Sigil (Tremere Only)**: [See page 25](../page-refs/page-25.md).

**Poor Reader**: You don't like to read, and don't read very well. When studying Arts or Knowledges from a book, treat the book as if its Quality were two levels lower.

**Poor Student**: You don't understand what others teach you very well. You get a –6 penalty to Lab Totals when learning spells or when working from the lab texts of others.

**Tormenting Master**: Your master does not believe you have successfully passed the apprentice's gauntlet (the test of becoming a magus). He periodically troubles you with political moves and indirect attacks.

**Twilight Points**: During apprenticeship you suffered an encounter with wild, strong magic that sent you into Wizard's Twilight ([see page 182](../page-refs/page-182.md)). The nature of the experience is important, as any future Twilight episodes will likely be related to the first. Consult with the storyguide to determine the exact nature and effect of the experience—both the number of Twilight points you have sustained as well as any effects you suffered. As this is a Flaw, good effects should not be generated from the Twilight encounter.

**Unimaginative Learner**: You have trouble figuring things out for yourself. Subtract one from rolls when you study from raw vis (before multiplication).

**Vis Obligation**: You must pay someone four pawns of vis a year, independent of any other obligation your covenant may have. Failing to pay your debt may lead to very serious consequences, such as Hermetic punishment. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Flaw based on the availability of vis in the Saga.

**Warped Magic**: Your magic is accompanied by some unpleasant side effect that always manifests itself the same way, but with increasing intensity according to the level of the spell. Examples include nearby items become hot or nearby plant matter becomes shriveled and wilted. This effect may cause trouble from time to time, but is usually just annoying.

**Weak Writer**: You write about magic slowly and methodically. You copy spells from your shorthand at (Scribe Latin x 10) levels per season, and copy (Scribe Latin x 30) levels of spells that have already been written out per season. You may only write summa up to one-third of your level in an Art of Knowledge, and write two levels less per season than normal. You copy summae at (Scribe + Dexterity) x 2 levels per season.

### -2 Flaws

**Clumsy Magic**: You have trouble targeting your spells accurately. Any spell that requires a targeting roll to aim its effect is subject to disastrous failure: a roll of 0 is automatically a botch. You receive a –3 penalty to any rolls involving Finesse.

**Discredited Lineage**: The quaesitores suspect your Hermetic line of some terrible crime such as diabolism or descent from House Diedne, and it's unlikely that your name will ever be cleared. They keep a close eye on everything you do or say. If wrongdoing takes place, you are the first they suspect. Should you ever be formally accused, people are likely to shoot first and ask questions later. The quaesitores also try very hard to keep members of your line from positions of authority. You have a bad Reputation of an appropriate type, level 4, among quaesitores.

**Lack Of Concentration**: You are profoundly unable to focus your mind. You cannot possess the Concentration Ability and cannot cast ritual spells.

**Lack Of Control**: After casting a spell, you must spend a round doing nothing but recovering your mental faculties.

**Limited Magic Resistance**: You are less able to resist magic than other magi. You gain no bonus from your Form scores to magic resistance rolls, though if you are caught without your Parma Magica, you retain a magic resistance of 0. You are still entitled to a natural resistance roll if it is applicable to the spell.

**Rigid Magic**: You cannot use vis when you cast spells. Thus, you cannot extend the duration or range of spells, increase your spell rolls, cast ritual magic, or create permanent effects. You can use vis in the laboratory.

**Short-Lived Magic**: Your spells do not last as long as they should. Spells that should be permanent last a year; those of a year, a moon; those of a moon, only to the next sunrise or sundown; and those of a sun, merely Diameter. Diameter, Concentration, and Instant spells are not affected, nor are those whose duration is enhanced by vis.

**Slow Caster**: Your magic requires more time to prepare and execute than that of other magi. Your formulaic spells take two rounds to cast; spontaneous spells also take two rounds unless you fast-cast. Ritual spells are performed as normal, since all magi must cast them slowly and carefully.

**Stingy Master**: Your master trained you less thoroughly than most, so you have only 130 points to buy spells and 130 points to purchase Arts instead of the usual 150 for each.

**Weak Magic**: You are particularly unskilled with a certain Art, making it difficult for you to overcome the natural and magic resistance of targets. When determining Penetration with that Art, halve your spellcasting roll. In addition, the target's Natural Resistance roll is at +3. The storyguide may disallow this Virtue for some Arts that rarely require penetration, or rarely call for natural resistance.

### -3 Flaws

**Magic Addiction**: You crave the rush of casting and holding power over magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you have a difficult time stopping yourself from casting again and again until you drop from exhaustion. Whenever you use a stress die in spellcasting, you must, whether or not the spell succeeds, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll, against a target number of half the level of the spell (or, if you botched, the level you were attempting). If you fail, you must immediately either cast a Formulaic spell of at least the same level as the previous spell, or cast any spontaneous spell, expending Fatigue. If you botch, you continue casting spells until you fall unconscious.

**Old**: You started your apprenticeship late in life, or were held far too long by your master. Your age is 40 + Stamina, or higher if you wish. This means you may have to make rolls on the Aging chart (without the aid of a longevity potion) before play even begins. Your first year as a magus will probably be spent in creating your longevity potion.

**Painful Magic**: Casting spells causes you to suffer the equivalent of one Body level in pain for each spell you cast. This reduces all your actions by the appropriate wound penalty, which is cumulative with any from actual injuries or fatigue (though you do not suffer any physical damage from pain). You recover these "pain levels" just like Fatigue levels.

**Study Requirement**: You are unable to study magic (including spells, Arts, and enchanted items) from books or vis alone. You must study in the presence of the appropriate Art. For example, you need to sit next to a brook or pond to study Aquam, or a large fire to study Ignem. Growing things are good for Creo, decaying ones good for Perdo. As your knowledge grows, you need to work with larger and larger quantities. This may limit your ability to learn some Arts. For example, the volcano that you need to learn Ignem 20 may be too dangerous to work near. This is up to the storyguide to decide.

**Weak Parma Magica**: Your Parma Magica offers no protection under relatively common circumstances which are fairly easy for an opponent to utilize, such as when you are wet or facing away from the caster of the spell. You would be well advised to keep your weakness from being discovered by too many potential enemies.

<!-- new [page 49](../page-refs/page-49.md) -->
### -4 Flaws

**Chaotic Magic**: Your magic is very wild. When you cast a spontaneous spell, you must specify a desired level of effect. If you fall short of or exceed that target by more than five levels, the spell still works, but its effects are beyond your control—the storyguide decides the results. When casting Formulaic spells or using vis, roll twice the normal number of botch dice. You may not Master spells.

**Susceptibility to Divine Power**: You are especially sensitive to the Dominion and suffer twice the normal penalties (such as spell-casting modifiers and botch rolls) to your magic when in a divine aura.

**Susceptibility to Faerie Power**: You are especially susceptible to the fey and their magic. Whenever you enter a faerie area, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than its aura rating to avoid becoming disoriented. In addition, your magic resistance score, including Parma Magica, against faerie magic is halved. If someone else uses their Parma Magica to protect you, their resistance is not affected and you benefit normally.

**Susceptibility to Infernal Power**: You are especially vulnerable to the dark powers. Whenever you enter an area of infernal influence, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than the aura rating or become ill (-1 on all rolls). You get only half your normal Magic Resistance score against infernal magic, though if someone else's Parma Magica is protecting you, it counts normally.

**Unpredictable Magic**: You must always roll a stress die when casting spells, even if you are completely relaxed. You may not master formulaic spells. Your lab work always requires a roll on the Extraordinary Results chart without the risk modifier ([see page 91](../page-refs/page-91.md)), though you do not get the experimentation bonus. If you do experiment, roll twice on the chart for each season you spend.

### -6 Flaws

**Non-Spontaneity**: Your magic is so strongly tied to the formulas and rituals of the Order of Hermes that you cannot cast spontaneous spells.

**Personal Magic**: Your magic works best on yourself, and your rolls to affect targets at ranges greater than Personal are halved. This penalty also applies to laboratory projects dealing with anything but yourself, including a familiar. Study is not affected.

**Unstructured Caster**: You have never quite mastered the intricacies of spellcasting, and are unable to perform formulaic magic without extreme effort. You cast all formulaic spells as though they were ritual spells (including the need for vis), and you may not learn ritual spells at all. You cast spontaneous spells normally.

## Companion Social Class

There are very defined strata in the society of Mythic Europe, and you must determine where your companion falls among them. (Magi do not pick a Social Class, since mundane status becomes largely irrelevant once they join the Order of Hermes. Grogs are all considered to be serfs, servants, or other such rabble.) Some Social Classes automatically include other Virtues and Flaws, which do not have an additional cost. Each companion can belong to only one of the following Social Classes.

Each of the Social Classes listed below comes with a Reputation equal in level to the Virtue or Flaw that provides it. The Reputation applies to those who would know of it—use common sense.

Social Class becomes important when dealing with those of a higher or lower social standing. In a situation where your status is important (such as when accusing someone of a crime, or perhaps trying to intimidate someone), the storyguide may decide to modify the chance of success by the difference between your Social Classes (positive or negative). For example, a priest accuses your freeman character of committing some crime. Actual guilt or innocence is irrelevant—all that matters to the magistrate is the status of the accuser and the accused. The freeman tries to defend his innocence, and you make a Bargain roll. The storyguide decides that the priest's +4 Social Class will hinder the success of the roll, and your target number is increased by the difference between Freeman (0) and Priest (+4).

Subject to storyguide approval, the higher Social Classes can also apply to important positions within the Church. Bishops, abbots and other powerful religious officials can be interesting and compelling characters in your saga, if played appropriately.

<!-- new [page 37](../page-refs/page-37.md) -->
### +0 Virtues

**Wanderer**: This is the default category. You are not tied to any liege or community, though you might well live at the covenant. You may have standard equipment and a riding horse.

**Covenfolk**: You have lived at the covenant for a long time, perhaps since birth. The quality of your armaments depends on the resources of the covenant.

**Freeman/Freewoman**: You most likely are a city dweller. You probably have a skill that allows you to survive, like blacksmithing, leatherworking, or other less savory work. You also have the tools necessary to perform your trade.

### +1 Virtues

**Failed Apprentice**: You were once apprenticed to a magus, but something kept you from completing your studies. Perhaps your Gift was incomplete, or maybe some grievous mishap robbed you of it altogether. You may still work for your former master. Magi welcome you and have compassion for you (those who are given to such emotions, anyway). You may have Arcane and Formal Knowledges as beginning Abilities, and you are familiar with the life of a magus. If your Gift was not completely destroyed, you most likely have some Exceptional Talents. You begin with whatever equipment your covenant is willing to provide you.

**Mendicant**: You are a member of a mendicant order, friars and sisters who go among the serfs and poor free farmers, spreading the word of the Church, conducting mass, performing marriage ceremonies, and baptizing children. You are sworn to serve the Church for the rest of your life. Although you are a servant of the Church, you lack political influence within the organization. You are poor, either by vow or by circumstance, and may have only inexpensive armaments. Due to your training, you have the +1 Virtue Educated.

**Petty Merchant**: You are struggling, but it is better than being a serf, by far. You own or run a business that generates significant wealth, but provides you with little (if any) political clout. You have to devote considerable time to managing and protecting your enterprise. You have a yearly income of about 400 silver pennies, and may own standard armaments and a mount.

**Wise One**: You belong to a broad class that includes mystics, seers, healers, and the like. You are probably magical, and will probably want to purchase a Virtue that gives you some sort of supernatural ability. You are well regarded in the community, although your presence may cause fear as well as awe or respect. If you lack such good standing, though, you are most likely a wanderer or an outcast. You may have standard armaments.

**Prosperous Peasant**: You are a free peasant, but you are wealthier than most of your kind. You hold a yardland (30 acres) in free tenancy, and this will yield an income of 400 silver pennies per year as long as it is worked. You may leave your farm, or even sell it, after play has started.

### +2 Virtues

**Knight-Errant**: You wander in search of adventure, honor, fame, and wealth. You are entitled to bear arms, and are a member of the nobility. You are accompanied by a bodyguard or squire, and begin play with the +2 Virtue Superior Armaments. You may purchase the Quality Armaments Virtue at one less point than listed, during character creation.

**Lesser Noble**: You are part of the nobility, though you have no title greater than "Lord" or "Lady." You probably reside near the covenant in the house of a local noble, and might be a niece, nephew, or other such distant relative. Although you do not want for anything, neither do you have vast wealth. You receive a stipend of about 40 silver pennies a month to spend as you see fit, but you will have to ask your family to buy very expensive items for you. You may have standard equipment.

**Mercenary**: You lead a small company of mercenaries (5 to 10 grogs), for hire to the highest bidder. You are much like a knight-errant, only without the prestige. During your travels you have gained great wealth—and squandered it—several times over. A less successful mercenary may be treated as a Wanderer (as above). You automatically have the +1 virtue Good Armaments. Your mercenaries have standard armaments.

### +3 Virtues

**Magister in Artibus**: You have incepted Master of Arts in one of the universities of Europe (Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge, Montpellier, Arezzo or Salamanca) and completed your two years' regency of compulsory teaching. You are entitled to be addressed as Magister, and you may teach at any university in Europe. You have the following abilities, at no cost: Speak Latin 5, Scribe Latin 3, Artes Liberales 3, Disputatio 3, and Lectio 3. You may purchase further Academic Knowledges or Skills during character generation, and may take the Further Education virtue to spend more time at university. You are at least (25 - Int) years old.

If the storyguide allows it, magi may take this virtue. Magi who take this Social Class began their magical training after incepted, so are relatively old. Such magi have an additional 21 experience points to spend on Arcane Talents, Skills, and Knowledges, as they did not need to learn Latin as part of their apprenticeship. You are at least (35 - Int) years old.

**Priest**: You are a member of the clergy, with a specific position of authority in the religious hierarchy. You therefore come under the protection of Canon Law, meaning that you cannot be prosecuted by secular authorities (even if you regularly fail to fulfill your vows). You are accorded some respect, or at least fear, due to your position, but nobles still usually outrank you since they have a great deal of political power in the Church. You have an income of approximately 30 silver pennies a month. You may tap parish funds for more, but you risk drawing the attention of the bishop if you do. You automatically have the +1 Virtue Educated, allowing you to purchase Formal Knowledges.

**Wealthy Merchant**: You are at the top of the growing merchant class, neither noble nor common. You have contacts throughout society, as well as some influence with the local ruler. You are quite wealthy and realize a profit of 2000 silver pennies a year, which you take as income. Furthermore, you have goods worth about five times that. You may have a bodyguard and standard armaments, and may also possess a large house or a ship that you live on.

### +5 Virtues

**Landed Knight**: You owe fealty and service to a higher noble, and control land, serfs, and men-at-arms. Your income is about 2000 silver pennies a year, after expenses, including food. You are usually accompanied on adventures by a bodyguard or squire (probably a grog, unless another player wants to develop the character as a companion). You have sworn an Oath of Fealty (as the -1 Flaw), and so may be called upon to serve your lord at inopportune moments. You begin the game with Superior Armaments (as the +2 Virtue). Typical armaments for a mid-13th century knight are lance, sword, kite shield, complete mail suit, and warhorse.

<!-- new [page 38](../page-refs/page-38.md) -->
### -1 Flaws

**Branded Criminal**: As punishment for some crime in your past, a mark has been burned into your cheek. This adversely affects your ability to function in society.

**Outcast**: You have the rough task of making it on your own—normal society rejects you and you are not attached to a covenant. Perhaps you have a magical nature, a supernatural background, some disfigurement, or a tremendous scandal in your past. You may have only inexpensive armaments.

### -2 Flaws

**Outlaw Leader**: You command a small group (three to six persons) of outlaws. Your followers look up to you and do what you tell them—within reason. However, you must occasionally stick up for the group or one of its members, as well as provide for them. You often have to deal with challenges to your leadership in one form or another. You are well known as an outlaw in the local area, so the Reputation that you normally get along with a Social Class is increased to 3 in this case. You are actively sought by the local lord, sheriff, or other such official.

### -4 Flaws

**Infamous Outlaw**: Everyone knows your name, and although nobody is devoted full-time to your capture, you can be sure that someone will be after you whenever you come to the attention of the authorities. You can trust no one, as the price on your head is so great it makes even other outlaws tempted to turn you in (which is why you left your old band). If you are caught, there might be a debate about whether to kill you outright or save you for public execution, but your death is assured.

## Grog Status Virtues and Flaws

Even among the common folk, there are certain distinctions that rate one person higher in the community than another. Similar to Companion Social Class, Grog Status is used not only to determine a grog's place in medieval society, but also to modify rolls when interacting with others, at the discretion of the storyguide. However, it only applies to other grogs and commoners. A magus or companion isn't going to be impressed by the fact that your grog is the best brawler in the guard barracks.

### +0 Virtues

**Petty Outlaw**: You are a member of a small (three to six person) outlaw band. You may have the support of your fellows, but must help them in return and do whatever the outlaw leader tells you—within reason. Your group has a bad Reputation at level 2 in the local area, and there may be a price on your head. You may have two pieces of standard armaments, but all the rest of your equipment must be inexpensive.

**Standard grog**: You are just another member of the covenant, doing your job day in and day out, toiling hard and playing harder. This is the default category.

### +1 Virtues

**Custos**: You are a trusted servant of the covenant, having demonstrated your skill or bravery to those you work for. The magi and Companions trust you to do your job well, and you don't let them down. You begin the game with a positive Reputation 1 of your choice, that only applies within the covenant. Furthermore, you are often the recipient of special favors like better food or living quarters than standard grogs.

**Grog Leader**: You may be a turb sergeant, the head of the kitchen staff, or some other such person. The highfolk of the covenant (the magi and companions) expect you to control the grogs, and you are the liaison between the two groups. As such, you are often "in the know" about the plans the highfolk have, and you use this information to prepare your people for their duties. Sometimes other grogs challenge your leadership, but a quick clout to the head or imposition of some other penalty usually makes them accept your authority.

### -1 Flaws

**Green**: You were trained at the covenant, but have never fought in a real battle. You cannot start with a positive score in any Personality Trait relating to bravery; increasing your confidence is important to your development and your advancement within the ranks.

**Hired Sword**: You are an experienced mercenary, but you are new at the covenant. You don't know the magi or their strange ways very well, and you might not fit in with the community of grogs just yet. You cannot have a Personality Trait that involves devotion towards the covenant.

## General Virtues

### Variable Virtues

**Faerie Blood**: Somewhere in your ancestry there is a faerie, and this relation gives you an intuitive grasp of the motivations and personalities of those magical folk. Faeries are more comfortable around you than around other humans, and given time, may even forget the mortal blood in your veins. You may refer to the supplement Faeries for further information.

**Type of Faerie Blood** (pick one):

**Goblin Blood (+1)**: You are descended from the dark faeries who rule the lands of darkness and cold. You are short, squat, and ill favored by humanity. Your Presence and Communication cannot be higher than 0 due to this dark nature. Still, it is not without benefit. You can see in the dark as if it were twilight, and you get +1 to all aging rolls. You also get +3 to all natural resistance rolls for those spells you want to resist.

**Sidhe Blood (+2)**: You are descended from one of the noble Sidhe who rule the lands of Summer and sunlight. You get +1 to all rolls to avoid afflictions due to aging, and +3 to all natural resistance rolls for those spells you want to resist. In addition, because of the striking and unusual qualities of your nature add +1 to your Presence, even it brings you total over +3. Many mortals may consider you fascinating or alluring.

Characters with this Virtue can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.

**Immunity**: You have an innate resistance to some sort of affliction. Add the cost for the degree of immunity, the commonality of the affliction, and its deadliness to determine the cost of this Virtue.

**Degree of Immunity**:

+3 to Soak rolls: +1
+6 to Soak rolls: +2
Total immunity: +3

**Commonality of the Affliction**:

Very Common (the average person comes into contact with it on a weekly basis): +1
Uncommon (the average person comes into contact with it once every few months): 0
Rare (the average person comes into contact with it once a year or less often): -1

**Deadliness of the Affliction**:

Inconvenient (like fevers, flus or the common cold): -1
Debilitating (like mild poisons or varieties of the plague): 0
Crippling (any effect that has a permanent effect but does not kill): +1
Deadly (any effect that can reasonably be expected to kill the average person): +2

**Knack**: You have an innate aptitude that gives you a positive modifier on rolls using a specific Ability. Whenever you use the appropriate Ability, you get the bonus, which is equal to the value of this Virtue. Knacks are never cumulative with other Virtues that grant bonuses to die rolls—you get the highest applicable bonus, not the sum of them. You may not purchase Knacks in Arcane Abilities or Affinities unless you are specifically permitted as a result of your membership in a particular house. You may not spend more than three points on a given Knack.

**Magic Item**: You begin the game with a magical artifact, perhaps an heirloom or an item gained on an earlier adventure. The item can range in power from a minor trinket to one created in the laboratory of a magus; the cost is +1 per 10 levels of spell effects invested in the item, with a minimum cost of 1. You may also buy other types of items: talismans cost +2, potions cost +1 per 10 points of Lab Total invested into their creation, and longevity potions cost +1 per 5 points of Lab Total invested in them. Longevity potions purchased in this way have been made by someone else, and you are not able to make more without developing a new formula.

**Purifying Touch**: You have the ability to cure a certain type of affliction by touch. The cost of the Virtue depends on how common and how severe the affliction is. For each person purified, you must spend one Fatigue level. This can be a divine gift (like English rulers' ability to cure the King's Evil, scrofula), a faerie power, or an inherited ability. You should determine the value of this Virtue in collaboration with the troupe or storyguide. In general, +1 would allow the curing of such diseases as common colds and minor fevers. A +3 Purifying Touch is required to be able to heal life-threatening diseases, and a +4 is needed to cure the most heinous of diseases.

<!-- new [page 39](../page-refs/page-39.md) -->
### +1 Virtues

**Alchemy**: You are skilled at creating potions, poisons, and elixirs, as well as refining alchemical substances. You are also familiar with alchemical techniques like distillation and fermentation. Alchemy is especially suited for some purposes, so bonuses apply when making certain types of potions: poisons are made at +5, antidotes at +4, healing and health potions at +3, and transformations at +2. Choosing this Virtue confers the Knowledge Alchemy 1, which can be improved as any other Knowledge.

**Ambidextrous**: You can use either hand equally well. You never suffer the -3 penalty for using a weapon in your off hand.

**Animal Companion**: You are accompanied by a loyal, intelligent (but mundane) animal that can obey simple commands. Your relationship with it is very close. If it should die, you would be profoundly upset.

**Animal Ken**: You have a profound empathy with animals that allows you to understand their motivations and feelings. This engenders a solemn love and respect for beasts of all kinds. If you have the Gift, animals are not bothered by your presence. By stroking and speaking softly to a wild (but not enraged) animal, you can tame it to your touch in a matter of minutes by successfully rolling Animal Ken + Perception against an ease factor of 9. In addition, you may apply one third (rounded up) of your Animal Ken score to Animal Handling rolls. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Animal Ken 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

**Arcane Lore**: You are privy to Hermetic knowledge, so you can choose Arcane Knowledges (normally restricted to magi) as beginning Abilities.

**Beginning Vis**: You start the saga with some vis stored up. Perhaps it was a gift from your mentor, or gained on some earlier adventure. You have seven pawns of vis related to any Art and can take this Virtue more than once. The storyguide may want to change this number to reflect vis availability in the saga.

**Berserk**: You are capable of entering a blinding rage when in combat or frustrating situations. You automatically gain the Personality Trait Angry +2 (or more, at your option). Any time you lose a Body level or wound an enemy, roll a stress die and add your Angry score. A roll of 9+ means you go berserk. The storyguide can also call for a roll when you are strongly frustrated. You may deliberately try to go berserk. In this case, you only need a 6+ when you lose a Body level or wound an enemy, or a 9+ if you have not been wounded or caused a wound. While berserk, you get +2 to Attack, Soak, and Fatigue scores, but suffer a -2 penalty to Defense. While berserk, you cannot retreat, hesitate to attack, or give quarter. If you are still berserk when there are no enemies present, you attack your friends. You may roll once per round to calm down if you desire, requiring a stress die + Perception - Angry to be a 6+.

**Book Learner**: You have a talent for comprehending the writings of others. When studying from books, treat them as if they were two Quality levels higher than they actually are.

**Busybody**: You usually know everything that is going on among your friends and acquaintances, especially in private matters. You are

<!-- End of page-36-40.md -->


<!-- Start of page-41-45.md -->

**Gossip**: You are always interested in rumors and gossip, and are frequently able to extract personal secrets from people. Among magi the language is more dignified, but the idea is the same: you keep tabs on the Hermetic community (your covenant, your house, and nearby covenants—at the least). However, magi probably don't have much knowledge of what's going on among the lower class members of their covenant unless this Virtue is specific to those people.

**Carefree**: You are unshakably cheerful and happy in all circumstances. You receive +6 on all rolls to resist despair and sorrow (including spell effects) and +3 to Communication rolls when dealing with those who appreciate your disposition.

**Cautious with (Ability)**: You are very careful with a specific Ability, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail when using it. You roll one less botch die than normal (minimum roll of one die) whenever you are required to roll botch dice.

**Clear Thinker**: You think logically and rationally. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to resist lies, confusion, befuddlement, and subterfuge—whether magical or mundane.

**Close Family Ties**: Your family is one of the most important things in your life, and still supports and aids you whenever possible, even at personal risk. Family members do not hesitate to do you any favor that is within their power, and can call on their friends and neighbors to help you. It works both ways, however; your family may require help from you some day.

**Common Sense**: Whenever you are about to do something contrary to what is sensible in the game setting, common sense (the storyguide) alerts you to the error. This is an excellent Virtue for a beginning player, as it legitimizes any help the storyguide may give.

**Contortions**: You are able to perform physical maneuvers beyond the scope of most people. Add your score in this Ability + Dexterity or Strength to any roll when attempting to break free of a hold or restraint, squeeze into a small space, or get through a small opening. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Contortions 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

**Direction Sense**: You have an uncanny ability to orient yourself and can determine which way is north by rolling Direction Sense + Perception of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Direction Sense 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

**Dousing**: You have the ability to find things beneath the earth through the use of a dousing rod (usually a forked stick) and your own intuitive sense. You concentrate on the thing to be found, hold your dousing rod out in front of you, and follow its subtle motions to the target. If you're looking for something specific, you must have an appropriate sympathetic connection to the thing sought (such as bottled water from a stream when searching for running water). Before you roll, designate the area in which you are searching—if the item sought is not present in that area, you automatically fail. The time required to search depends on the size of the area, and must be invested whether you succeed or not. To find something common, like water within 25 paces, requires a Perception + Dousing of 9+. Increased distances or dousing for less common things increases the target number. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Dousing 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

**Educated**: You have been educated in a Grammar School, and may have attended a university or cathedral school. You have a score of 3 in Speak Latin and 1 in Scribe Latin, and may purchase Academic Knowledges or Skills at character generation. You are at least (18 - Int) years old. Magi may not select this virtue—this sort of training is given to all starting magi.

**Empathy**: You can intuitively understand the emotional needs of others and can therefore respond to them more appropriately. Add your Empathy score to rolls on appropriate Traits such as Communication and Presence. In addition, you may apply one third (rounded up) of your Empathy score to Folk Ken rolls. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Empathy 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Enduring Constitution**: You can withstand pain and fatigue. Decrease the penalties for reduced Body and Fatigue levels by one point. You also get +3 on rolls to resist pain.

**Faerie Upbringing**: Perhaps you were abandoned by your true kin, and the faeries found you. Maybe your family actually lived in a faerie forest, or faeries took you as a babe. Though you are now back in human society, you feel at home with and have an enhanced understanding of faeries, magic, and other strange things. You have the equivalent of the +1 Virtue Common Sense when dealing with Faerie. However, you find human society, including religion, bizarre. You cannot have Social Skills as starting Abilities, but may purchase the Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if you cannot otherwise buy Arcane Knowledges.

**Free Expression**: You have the imagination and creativity needed to compose a new ballad or to paint an original picture, and have the potential to be a great artist. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to create a new work of art.

**Further Education**: You have spent two years at a university or cathedral school in pursuit of higher learning. You have an additional seven experience points to spend on Academic Knowledges or Skills. This virtue may be taken multiple times. You may only take this Virtue if you already have the Educated or Magister in Artibus Virtue. In either case, your minimum age increases by two every time you take it. For example, an Educated character with Intelligence +2 who takes this virtue twice must be at least 20 years old. See Magister in Artibus on [page 38](../page-refs/page-38.md).

**Good Armaments**: You can start with any standard armaments and one expensive weapon or piece of armor.

**Healer**: You have an empathic understanding of how to aid the wounded, the sick, and the suffering. Add one third (round up) your Healer score to any Chirurgy or Medicine roll, and to the recovery rolls of anyone you tend regularly. You can also use this Ability to calm the grieving and to soothe pain. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Healer 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Heir**: You have little power or wealth now, but you stand to inherit land and possibly money. You need do nothing special to remain in your position, but others may occasionally attempt to remove you from the line of succession—one way or another. When you finally win your inheritance you gain its responsibilities as well, so your freedom may be restricted.

**Herbalism**: You are skilled at releasing the inherent magical properties of plants for use in potions, elixirs, pastes, and powders. Herbalism is particularly suited for some purposes, so you get bonuses when making certain kinds of substances: poisons +5, antidotes +5, healing and health +5, and hallucinogens +3. You can also identify plants, know when to harvest them, and understand their special properties. Choosing this Virtue confers the Knowledge Herbalism 1, which can be improved as any other Knowledge.

**Higher Purpose**: Let others concern themselves with petty matters, you have a nobler goal. This purpose should be altruistic, like freeing an oppressed people or bringing peace between the Order of Hermes and society. You gain +3 on Personality Trait rolls made to pursue your goal.

**Indentured Servant**: You have a personal attendant to cater to your everyday needs and desires. The servant generally follows your commands but is not trained to fight and is not highly skilled, having experience points in Abilities equal to his age in years. If the term of service is limited, and you want the servant to remain, you should provide some strong motivation. If your servant ever dies, or ends his service, you have no replacement.

**Inspirational**: You are a stirring speaker or a heroic figure, and can urge people to great efforts. You give targets a +3 bonus to rolls for appropriate Personality Traits, and +3 to natural resistance rolls versus certain spells that affect the mind.

**Keen Vision**: You can see farther and more clearly than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving sight, not including attacks with missile weapons.

**Large (companions and grogs)**: Your Size is +1 instead of 0. This gives you have an extra winded Fatigue level and an extra hurt Body level.

**Learn From Mistakes**: You are able to improve a particular Ability through the expedient of repeated failure. The first time in a given story that you botch a roll or fail by exactly one point, you gain one experience point in the Ability. You may take this Virtue several times, once for each Ability chosen.

**Light Sleeper**: You can wake up almost instantly when disturbed and can take action immediately once awake, without the usual penalties. The storyguide may also allow generous Perception rolls to see if noises wake you.

**Long-Winded**: You can last longer when exerting yourself than most, and gain +3 on all your Fatigue rolls. This bonus does not apply to casting spells.

**Magic Sensitivity**: You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical effects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from all natural resistance and magic resistance rolls you make. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Magic Sensitivity 1, which can be improved as Talents. When attempting to sense the magic nature of a place or object, the storyguide will assign an ease factor—simply roll a simple die + Perception + Magic Sensitivity.

**Mimicry**: You are able to imitate others' voices, as well as animal sounds. Mimicry is far from perfect, though, and you have to work hard to convincingly reproduce a specific person's voice: roll Mimicry + Communication of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Mimicry 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Perfect Balance**: You are skilled at keeping your balance, especially on narrow ledges or tightropes. Add +6 to any roll to avoid falling or tripping.

**Premonitions**: You intuitively sense whenever something is wrong, or is likely to go wrong soon. This Ability can be called upon by you or the storyguide, as appropriate, whenever there is a chance to avoid danger. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Premonitions 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Prestigious Family**: Your family is well known and respected. When in dire need, others may help you because of your relatives, or your family itself may provide assistance. You begin the game with a Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who know your family.

**Rapid Convalescence**: Your body can heal quickly. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to recover from wounds.

**Read Lips**: You have a limited, self-taught Ability to understand the speech of people you cannot hear, simply by watching their mouths. This Ability is far from perfect, and you get many words confused: roll Read Lips + Perception of 9+ to be accurate in your interpretations. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Read Lips 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Reckless**: You tend not to notice that situations are threatening. You start with a Personality Trait of Reckless +3, and can never have a positive Personality Trait reflecting care or patience. Whenever the storyguide deems it necessary for you to check bravery or a similar Personality Trait, make a roll against your Reckless score instead. A success means you do not realize your danger, and can act immediately without further checks.

**Second Sight**: You are able to see ghosts, demons, and other invisible spirits. A roll of 9+ on Second Sight + Perception is usually successful, but your target may be higher or lower at the storyguide's discretion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Second Sight 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Secret Hiding Place**: You know of a spot that is out of sight or just very difficult to get to, unknown to all but a few (or just yourself) and so is an excellent hiding place when you are in trouble. You may occasionally have problems getting there, but once hidden you are basically safe. However, there is always the risk that someone may find your hiding place, putting you in some kind of a predicament.

**Self-Confident**: You have firm confidence in your own abilities. You begin the game with one extra Confidence point. You may take this Virtue up to three times, if you wish.

**Sense Holiness and Unholiness**: You are able to feel the auras of good and evil. A Perception + Sense Holiness and Unholiness roll of 9+ lets you sense holiness or unholiness in a general area; 15+, in a person or object. In auras of particularly strong divine or infernal influence, your sensitivity may overwhelm you. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Sense Holiness and Unholiness 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Sharp Ears**: You hear better than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving hearing.

**Social Contacts**: You have a broad range of acquaintances in a specific social circle (specified when this Virtue is purchased), accumulated over years of travel and socializing. Almost everywhere you go, you meet someone you know, or can get in touch with someone who can help you. Whenever you are somewhere new, you can contact someone on a simple Presence roll of 6+. The storyguide may modify this target number upward for very small areas or areas where it is extremely unlikely that you would know someone. You may purchase this Virtue more than once, each time specifying a different social group.

**Strong Personality**: For any three Personality Traits, you may have scores from -6 to +6 instead of the usual -3 to +3.

**Strong-Willed**: You cannot easily be coerced into activities, beliefs, or feelings. You get +3 on any roll which may require strength of will.

**Tough**: You can take physical punishment better than most people. You get a +3 bonus on your Soak score.

**Troupe Upbringing**: You were raised among a group of entertainers, spending much of your childhood traveling from town to town. Rolls involving Performance Skills and Physical Talents in a selected area (which you should have approved by the storyguide) receive a +3 modifier. Examples might include tumbling and acrobatics, knife throwing and juggling, or storytelling and acting.

**True Friend**: You have a very close friend who is your confidant, supporter, and ally in all things. The two of you do not hesitate to help the other, and you do not question each other's needs. Friendship brings obligations as well as benefits—if anything bad happens to your friend, you are distraught (and, if appropriate, vengeful). You and your friend both have a Personality Trait of Loyal +3 to each other.

**Venus' Blessing**: People are often attracted to you. You get +3 on Communication and Presence rolls with sexually compatible characters in appropriate situations. At times you can put this to good use. At other times it's an annoyance.

**Versatile Sleeper**: You can fall asleep at will, anywhere, anytime, enjoying sleep whenever you have a few minutes. Thus, each day you get the equivalent of a full night's rest without having to spend the night in unbroken slumber. You can be awakened normally when napping.

**Veteran**: You spent at least two years campaigning, perhaps on one of the Crusades. During that time, you improved your martial skills to some extent. You may spend seven experience points on Weapon Class Abilities, or any other Abilities that your storyguide approves of that you might have learned or improved while campaigning. You may take this virtue more than once.

**Weather Sense**: You are in tune with the subtle nuances of the weather. On a roll of Weather Sense + Perception of 9+, you can sense what the weather will be like the next day, or sooner if conditions are rapidly changing. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Weather Sense 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

**Well-Known**: You have a good Reputation, level 2, in a particular area near the covenant, and are generally well liked.

**Well-Traveled**: You have journeyed extensively in this part of the world and find it easy to get along with people throughout the area. You are familiar with regional dialects and can pick others up quickly, giving you +3 to appropriate speaking rolls. In addition you know something of local habits and traditions, giving you get a +3 bonus to appropriate Knowledge rolls, such as Legend Lore.

### +2 Virtues

**Blackmail**: You have information that some powerful person would prefer kept hidden. You receive payments or services in return for your silence, and you may occasionally demand special favors. Don't push your luck—your victim may decide it isn't worth the cost, or silence you permanently. This benefit has a yearly value of about 50 silver pennies, possibly more if you keep the pressure on. You should detail and record the specifics of this arrangement.

**Enchanting Music**: When you set your mind to it, you can influence others in a specific way with your music. For a specific effect, you must sing words that people can understand. You can calm the grieving with tunes alone, but you need lyrics to convince peasants to rise up against the local lord. When you use Enchanting Music, roll a die (stress or simple, depending on the situation) and add Communication and Enchanting Music. A roll 9+ will calm the upset, a 12+ will win someone's love, a 15+ will incite a riot, an 18+ will touch the heart of a Magus, and a 24+ might win back a soul from the Prince of Darkness. If you botch, you inspire an unwanted emotion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Enchanting Music 1, which can be improved as other talents.

**Faerie Friend**: You have an ally among the fey. How much assistance you can get depends on the power of the friend—a small faerie with (relatively) minor powers can accompany you on a day to day basis. Powerful faeries have other business, and may only be available to answer questions and provide guidance, not to accompany you around on your adventures. Your ally is fully sentient, has its own powers, and can speak when it chooses. You may want to have another player act the part. While a faerie companion can be a great boon, it can also be a terrible burden. If it is nasty or mischievous, it could cause trouble for you everywhere. Characters with this Virtue can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.

**Famous**: You have a good Reputation, level 4, in the area surrounding the covenant. You should detail the noteworthy deeds you performed to earn this fame.

**Gossip**: You have regular social contacts in the area that provide you with all kinds of information about local social and political goings-on. On a simple roll of 6+, you hear interesting news before almost everyone else. You treat all local Reputations as twice their actual level. With some well-placed words, you may be able to bestow new Reputations (whether deserved or not). You quite likely have a Reputation too—as a gossip.

**Great (Characteristic)**: You may raise any Characteristic from +3 to +4. Make sure you describe what it is about you that causes that increase (such as sheer bulk, a lean build, or extreme charisma).

**Hex**: You have the power to bring injury or ruin to your enemies. You must wish a specific calamity upon a person by cursing him aloud, and the storyguide (based on a stress die roll modified only by your Hex score) determines whether you succeed. Example target numbers are 9+ to cause a calf to be born with three legs, 15+ to bring a debilitating illness in the victim's family, or 21+ to cause the victim to be killed in a strange accident. Assuming the roll is successful, the hex strikes your victim anywhere from a day to a month later. Divine power or magic might offer protection, but a hex can often bypass this by affecting the victim indirectly. Sometimes the Church punishes those whose curses are widely known to have come true. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Hex 1, which can be improved with experience points.

**Indulgences**: You have a number of indulgences (remissions of sin), which have been bestowed upon you by the Pope. You may sell these, keeping some money for yourself, or you may grant them to individuals in return for "services to the Church" (that is, doing something for you). Each indulgence confirms the remission of one sin, and you can have no more than 20 at any time (roll two dice). When all have been granted or sold, you may purchase more by returning to Rome.

**Intuition**: You have a natural sensitivity that allows you to make the right decisions more often than luck can account for. Whenever you are given a choice in which luck plays a major role (such as deciding which of three unexplored paths to follow), you have a good chance of choosing correctly. The storyguide should secretly roll a simple die. On a 6+, your intuition kicks in and you make what ever might be considered the "right" decision. Otherwise, you fail to get any flash of insight and must make the decision without aid.

**Jack-of-All-Trades**: Despite your lack of training, you can attempt things that others equally unskilled would find more difficult. You suffer no penalties to rolls against a Skill in which you have no score, provided you have some time to consider what you are about to do. (There is normally a -3 penalty to use Abilities you do not possess.) Skills that are exclusive to a particular group (such as Hermetic Skills to magi) are still beyond you, unless you belong to the appropriate group.

**Training**: You have access to a trainer who has a score of 6 in three different Ability Scores, and can teach you during one season each year. This trainer has a +1 Communication. Determine the specifics of the individual and the relationship with your storyguide. You may have to travel to get training, but do not have to pay or provide services in return for it.

**Latent Magic Ability**: You have a magical quality that has not yet manifested itself. You probably do not realize you have this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguide's discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine).

**Lightning Reflexes**: You respond to surprises almost instantly. In fact, your reflexes are sometimes so fast that you don't have a chance to think about how you are going to respond. Whenever you are surprised or startled, roll a stress die + Quickness. If you get a 3 or better, you respond reflexively. You must tell the storyguide what one type of action (attacking, blocking, running, etc.) you would like to respond with. If attacking in response, you gain +9 to your Initiative Total. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what happens (though it is always in the best interests of your immediate self-preservation). You only react to threats that you are not fully aware of, so you don't get a bonus against an assassin you watch sneak up on you. Note that you do not get a choice about whether to react. You could just as easily skewer a friend sneaking up in fun as you would an assassin about to strike. Also note that you must perceive an action to react to it—you can still be easily killed in your sleep. This Virtue gives you no special powers of perception.

**Light Touch**: You have especially good hand-eye coordination and great proficiency for using your hands in precise, fast ways. You gain +3 to all rolls involving subtle manipulation of objects (like picking pockets) and roll one less botch die than you normally would in such activities (minimum of one). This bonus does not apply to archery.

**Luck**: You perform well in situations where luck is more of a factor than skill or talent. You get +1 to +3 (storyguide's discretion) on rolls in such situations, depending upon how much luck is involved. You do well at games of chance, but may be labeled a cheater if you play them too often.

**Magical Animal Companion**: You are accompanied by a magical animal that's smart enough to follow your orders. The smaller and more innocuous the creature, the more intelligent it is. A ferret or crow is as intelligent as a human, a wolf is very cunning, and an animal the size of a horse is simply more intelligent than normal. If you wish, you may give your magical companion up to two points of Virtues, balanced with one Flaw point of your own. The creature has a Magic Might score of 10 - Size.

**Mentor**: A person of some importance, wealth, or wisdom has taken an interest in your life, and at times provides you with material aid and advice. However, at some point your mentor may have a small favor to ask of you. He might not necessarily like your relationship with the covenant—perhaps you must keep it a secret.

**Patron**: An influential person provides you with materials and a handsome (by medieval standards) salary, in return for services of some kind. The relationship with your patron is one of business more than friendship, and you may occasionally have to walk on eggshells to avoid any unacceptable behavior, whether real or imagined.

**Piercing Gaze**: By staring intently at people you make them feel uneasy, as if you are peering into their souls. Those with ulterior motives, uneasy consciences, or lying tongues must make rolls against an appropriate Personality Trait, Guile, or whatever the storyguide deems appropriate, to remain calm. Furthermore, you gain a +3 to rolls involving intimidation. Faeries and demons are unfazed by your power.

**Reserves of Strength**: Once per day, when in need, you can perform an incredible feat of strength. For the duration of the action, add +3 to your effective Strength score. Afterwards, though, you must make two Fatigue rolls.

**Skinchanger**: You have a magical cloak, animal skin or similar item made from an animal. While in physical contact with it, you may transform into the form of the animal represented by the item. The transformation takes one full round, and you retain both intelligence and sentience while in animal form. Clothing and possessions (save the animal item) do not transform, and you may be seen as a transformed human with InIm 20 or similar spells. If the item is stolen, the new owner has a arcane connection to you, and you may not transform until the item is retrieved. Skinchangers may transform into any nonmagical animal between Size -5 (robin) and Size +2 (bear). The character has the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter ([see page 252](../page-refs/page-252.md)), except that +3 is added to the character's Soak score (in animal form only).

**Superior Armaments**: You can start with expensive arms and armor.

**Temporal Influence**: Through blood or a position of trust, you enjoy some political weight in society. You have the ear of a leader and may yourself lead common folk at times, if they respect your position. The more influence you have, the more responsibility, and the harder it is to work unopposed with magi.

**True Love**: You have found the one person meant for you in all of creation, and the bond between the two of you cannot be sundered. Whenever you are suffering, in danger, or dejected, the thought of your love will give you strength to persevere. Thus, you may add +3 to appropriate Personality Trait rolls, and add additional bonuses as allowed by the storyteller (never in excess of +3) to activities that will return you to your love, or save her life. In dire need, she may even come to rescue you. On the other hand, you are tied to your lover, to whom you must return frequently. If you do not, you may suffer penalties to most actions requiring spirit due to melancholy. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it.

**Visions**: You often see images related to emotionally or magically laden events. A vision might be of the past, a possible future, or a distant occurrence, and is often symbolic or confusing. Visions usually come to you at quiet times in places connected with a powerful emotional or magical event, such as the site of a patricide or diabolic sacrifice. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Visions 1, which can be improved with experience points. When you wish to use this Talent, you tell the storyguide what specifically you would like to have a vision regarding. The storyguide assigns an ease factor based on the difficulty of gaining information about the topic. The storyguide should then make the roll in secret—on a botch, incorrect information is divulged.

**Withstand Magic (companions and grogs)**: You are innately nonmagical and can resist many spell effects. You have a +6 bonus to natural resistance rolls against spells, faerie powers, and infernal powers. This bonus also applies to your Soak score against damage from spells. You resist good magic as well, and suffer a -6 penalty on any roll to determine if a beneficial spell (like healing) affects you. This Virtue does not apply to the effects of Exceptional Talents, nor does it protect against powers of the Dominion. You can have no magical powers.

### +3 Virtues

**Charmed Life**: Fortune protects you from the most terrible injury and harm. Whenever you botch, you may reroll the original roll and take the better result. You should describe in detail how you manage to avoid the terrible fate. The storyguide should also be lenient where there is a chance of your rescue or protection.

**Fast Learner (companions and grogs)**: You get an extra experience point per story and per year (allotted during the summer) because of your ability to pick up knowledge faster than normal. You begin the game with 10 extra experience points to use in purchasing Abilities. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Virtue—it is much more useful in decade- or century-spanning sagas than it is in more short-lived ones.

**Giant Blood (companions and grogs)**: The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.

**Guardian Angel**: You have learned to hear the words of a divine watcher who gives you practical and spiritual advice. The angel whispers in your ear and tells you what is best for you spiritually, rather than materially. It approves of violence only when there is a holy reason—often difficult to demonstrate. If you act against the angel's advice, it may leave you until you correct your ways. Your guardian angel may help you by bestowing +3 to rolls when you are resisting infernal powers, depending on the current state of your soul. The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, it can hear and converse with you.

**Highly Trained**: You start with 20 additional experience points that you may spend in any way that you choose.

**Large (magi)**: As the +1 Virtue of the same name for companions and grogs.

**Protection**: You are under the aegis of a powerful person, usually a noble or high-ranking Church official (though other options are possible, if the storyguide approves). Those who know of your favored status treat you carefully; those who do not often pay the price. You have a Reputation (good or bad, your choice) of level 3, which could be higher if your protector is particularly great or well-known.

**Relic**: You own a holy relic, such as the finger bone of a saint, with one Faith point in it. This can be built into any other item you possess (a sword, for instance).

**True Faith**: Through piety and holy devotion you have faith that can move mountains. You have one Faith point and can gain more. For more about Faith points, [see page 244](../page-refs/page-244.md).

**Visual Eidetic Memory**: You remember everything you see as vivid images, giving you an increased chance to recall things and visualize them precisely. You gain +3 to all Intelligence rolls to remember a scene; if successful, you get another roll at an additional +3 (+6 total) to recollect all but the slightest of details.

**Wealth**: You own land and other valuable things, and have a yearly income of about 700 silver pennies. You can have a mount of your own and automatically start the game with excellent arms and armor.

### +4 Virtues

**Destiny**: Your life is heading toward a definite, though as yet unknown, culmination, whose nature is hinted at in prophecies and dreams. This sense of purpose gives you the strength to overcome fear, depression, and discouragement caused by anything not relevant to your destiny; you gain +3 on appropriate rolls. If an untimely demise ever threatens the fulfillment of your purpose, then something, somehow, will likely preserve you. You will meet your fate at the proper time, though it may cost you your life. You must have the approval of your storyguide to select this Virtue.

**Divination**: Divination involves divining the nature, location, and possible futures of people, places, objects, and events through a variety of methods. This Virtue grants you the Exceptional Talent Divination at level 1, which can be improved with experience. Numerous types of divination existed in the 13th Century. This talent gives a character knowledge of only a specific type of divination. Common forms of divination in this era include astrology, analyzing dreams, gazing into fires, crystals, or mirrors, and reading the entrails of animals. Each variety of divination gives similar results, but each requires its own special preparations which must be performed in order to divine effectively. To ask a question the diviner must make a stress roll adding Divination and Intelligence; the result must equal the level of difficulty for the question being asked.

Examples of sample questions with their levels of difficulty are listed below. Note that divination does not imply predestination. A correct reading about the future will only give you the most likely of all of the possible futures.

| Roll Required | Nature of Question  |
| --- | --- |
| 9+ | Answer one question about a distant person's current fate.  |
| 9+ | Answer one question about an object which is present.  |
| 12+ | Determine the location or fate of a distant object.  |
| 12+ | Determine the basic character of a person  |
| 15+ | Determine auspicious and inauspicious days and times for performing a given endeavor *  |
| 18+ | Determine some important piece of information about the possible future of an individual  |
| 18+ | Determine the likely course of a planned endeavor  |

*If the diviner successfully determines the best day and time for a single endeavor which takes place in a limited time frame (not more than a day) and requires a single roll (for example, looking for a lost treasure, asking a favor of the king, or playing a game of chess with death), then the diviner rolls a simple die, and compares it with the following: 1-6: +3, 7-9: +6, 10: +9. The bonus determined is then added to the roll in question, provided that the endeavor is undertaken at the proper time. The storyguide decides how far into the future the divined time is.

If the endeavor is a long one requiring numerous rolls, like fighting a battle, going on a journey, or slaying a dragon, a successful divination roll gives a +1 to all rolls directly concerning this endeavor. If the diviner botches the roll to determine an auspicious day and time, then they have inadvertently determined the worst possible time for such an endeavor, and all the bonuses listed above are treated as penalties.

**Entrancement**: You have the power to control another's will. By staring deeply into someone's eyes for several seconds—generally impossible in combat—you can verbally command the person to perform a certain task. Roll Presence + Entrancement against the target's Stamina roll. The person being controlled may get a bonus to resist at the option of the storyguide, according the table below. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Entrancement 1, which can be improved as other Talents can.

### +5 Virtues

**Fast Learner (magi)**: You get an extra experience point per story and per year in the summer because of your ability to pick up knowledge faster than normal. You also receive a +1 on rolls to study from vis (before multiplication). You begin the game with 10 extra experience points to use in purchasing Abilities.

**Giant Blood (magi)**: The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.

**Mythic (Characteristic)**: You have may raise one Characteristic from +3 to +5, making it a score of epic proportions. In addition to this increase, once per day you may perform an incredible feat of limited duration (such as lifting an extreme weight, running a great distance in a single day, or using a bow to shoot a cherry out of someone’s hand) related to that Characteristic, without having to make a roll. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what is and what is not an incredible feat—kicking over a mountain and inventing a spell in one day are outside the realm of even mythic characters. Magi with mythic Characteristics can never perform incredible feats of lab work.

## General Flaws

### Variable Flaws

**Cursed**: You have incurred the enmity of someone or something powerful enough to put a curse on you, which may be magical, divine, faerie, or infernal. The severity of the curse determines the number of Flaw points: in general, the more intense or commonly manifested the effect, the higher the point value. Example –1 Curses: everything you say is taken in the worst possible way, or a live toad appears in your mouth when you speak a direct lie. Example –2 Curses: you stutter uncontrollably when you try to say something important, or if you ever tell a secret that was entrusted to you, the secret somehow harms you. Example –3 Curses: you are pained by light, with greater light bringing greater pain, or you see shapes and phantoms in the night that terrify and immobilize you. Example –4 Curses: you are doomed to be wounded in every battle you take part in (and in some that you try to avoid), or normal tools break whenever you use them.

**Enemies**: Someone is causing trouble for you, such as a local baron or bishop, a band of outlaws, or a really nasty innkeeper. The enemy must be powerful enough to endanger you—this is best agreed on with the storyguide and the rest of the troupe. The value for a local enemy with moderate means is –1. Vastly powerful enemies with considerable means and spare time to spend making your life miserable are worth up to –4.

**Outsider**: You belong to a group that is both readily identifiable and distrusted or disliked. Examples include Saracens, Jews, and Moors. You are shunned and often persecuted because of this, and your life and freedom may occasionally be in peril. You have a bad Reputation of level 1 to 3 (depending upon how easy it is to identify you) among members of the dominant social group of your area. There is no way for you to ever remove that stain, and you are marked by it wherever you go. The cost of this Flaw is equal to the Reputation that it causes.

**Vow**: You have sworn to do something difficult, and breaking your vow is a serious matter. Examples vows include never raising a weapon, never speaking, or living in poverty. If you do fail to uphold your vow, you must perform some kind of atonement, whether it be religious penance or coming to terms with your failure in some other way. Furthermore, you lose one point of Confidence. Depending on your vow, some people may respect your dedication, giving you a good Reputation of level 1 among those people. The cost of this Flaw depends on the severity of your vow and the frequency with which it is tested. The storyguide is the final arbiter of the cost of this Flaw.

### -1 Flaws

**Bad Reputation**: People in an area know of you and hold you in ill regard. Choose an appropriate Reputation, level 2, within that area.

**Black Sheep**: You come from a prestigious family, but you have somehow estranged yourself from your relatives. They have nothing to do with you, unless they wish to punish you somehow. Those who resent your family’s power can take safe revenge by assaulting you. You begin the game with a bad Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who respect your family.

**Compulsion**: You have an unfortunate urge that causes you problems. Examples include drinking, sex, perfection, bragging, or gambling. You may take this Flaw more than once.

**Dark Secret**: You are haunted by something that would lead to shame, rejection, and possibly revenge if discovered. Hints about the secret continually arise, and there might be others who know it and could betray you. This makes you avoid certain places, dislike certain people, or fear certain things.

**Deep Sleeper**: When you sleep, you don't go halfway. You can sleep through loud noises and generally only wake up when shaken, or when good and ready. Even then you suffer -3 on your rolls for half an hour or so after awakening, and you're likely to head back to bed if at all possible.

**Delusion**: You believe wholeheartedly in something that just isn't so. Examples include that you are a magus (if you are not), that you are the Pope's child, or that your imaginary friend is real. This can cause real problems for you and your associates.

**Dependent**: You are responsible for someone, like a young child or a decrepit grandparent. This restricts your freedom and time in a variety of ways, which may change with time—a child grows up and moves away, a grandparent gets seriously ill and requires constant care. You may take this Flaw repeatedly to reflect several dependents.

**Disfigured**: A visible disfigurement makes you ugly and easy to recognize. Presence rolls that involve good looks and gaining respect from most people are at -3. You probably have a cruel nickname that refers to your unfortunate appearance.

**Driving Goal**: You have some personal objective that you feel compelled to attain, even if it gets you into trouble or jeopardizes the group. Such goals are ideal or open-ended—you can never finally accomplish them. Examples include freeing peasants from oppression, harassing and killing Norman warriors, or amassing vast amounts of personal wealth. You may take this flaw more than once.

**Dutybound**: You adhere to a restrictive code of conduct that forbids certain behavior, probably including prohibitions against lying, killing prisoners, stealing, and other occasionally useful actions. You follow this code out of guilt or fear rather than high-flown moral standards, and may spend more time justifying yourself than keeping your conduct pure.

**Evil Eye**: One of your eyes is misshapen, causing your face to have a frightening appearance. People generally regard you as evil, and hide their children's faces from your gaze. You are at a -3 when dealing with mundanes in any social setting, in addition to any penalty you may have for the Gift.

**Expenses**: You must pay a significant portion of your wealth and income (25% - 50%) to a person or organization, or devote it to expenses that bring you no personal gain. Failure to pay your dues brings unpleasant consequences, such as the loss of privileges or the ill will of an important person.

**Faerie Enmity**: Faeries dislike you and take every opportunity to pester you. Faerie forests are extremely dangerous, but even field faeries may spoil your food, plague your dreams, or otherwise torment you. Luckily, your life is not in danger—they prefer to let you live so they can continue to harass you.

**Favors**: You owe a boon to someone (or to a great many people), and may be called upon to return the favor at any time. The consequences of ignoring such a request can range from mild to deadly serious, at the storyguide's discretion.

**Fragile Constitution**: You are sickly and weak. You suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls to recover from wounds and diseases.

**Hatred**: You are consumed with hatred for some person who is so powerful that exacting proper vengeance is impractical or impossible. Nevertheless, you constantly pursue opportunities to gain power over or hurt the object of your hatred, so much so that your reason is clouded.

**Hunchback (magi)**: You have a deformed body that gives you a grotesque appearance and hinders your movements. You are at a -3 to all rolls involving agility and balance. Presence rolls that involve good looks are at a -3.

**Infamous Family**: Your family is very well known, but not very well liked. You have a bad Reputation at level 3 among those who know your family, and have a particularly hard time losing it because it applies to the whole family, not just you. You have trouble trusting others because the community has always acted against you.

**Judged Unfairly**: Somehow you come across the wrong way to people, and they universally distrust and underestimate you. You catch no one's eye, impress no one, and can get no one to take you seriously. If you ever find an exceptional someone who sees you as you want to be seen, you will cling to that person.

**Lost Love**: You have lost your true love to death, distance, or marriage. You take little joy in life's pleasures and give up easily in the face of difficulty, since you've already lost the most important struggle. On those occasions when you forget yourself and have a good time, you inevitably feel sorrow afterwards, thinking about how it could have been if your love were with you.

**Low Self-Esteem**: You have a deflated opinion of your own self-worth. You begin the game with only 2 Confidence points.

**Magical Air (companions and grogs only)**: Although you do not have the Gift, you look and act like a magical person. This can be detrimental when dealing with mundane society—you suffer the same -3 penalty to social interaction rolls as magi.

**Magic Susceptibility**: You are easily affected by magic. You suffer a -3 penalty on all magic resistance and natural resistance rolls, and get -3 to Soak against direct magical damage. However, you receive a +3 bonus when rolling for the effects of beneficial magic.

**Meddler**: You want to fix other peoples' lives: arrange matches, teach children to sew "properly," or tend the sick. You waste a lot of time and energy on such endeavors, and people usually resent it. You have a Personality Trait of Meddlesome +3 and a bad Reputation, level 1, as a meddler. If you are a magus, you probably interfere in the affairs of other magi, companions, and apprentices. You don't violate Hermetic law, but you probably come close—and you almost certainly irritate the other magi of your covenant.

**Missing Ear**: You cannot accurately locate the direction of sounds, and suffer a penalty of -3 to hearing rolls.

**Missing Eye**: You cannot judge close distances easily and get -3 on Attack rolls for missiles. In melee combat you suffer -1 on Attack rolls because your field of vision is limited. You also have a blind side from which people can approach unseen. This Flaw can be combined with Poor Eyesight (below), but the penalties are cumulative.

**Oath of Fealty**: You owe one season of service each year to someone or some organization outside the covenant. Additionally, you must justify your actions to those persons, and sometimes there is a conflict between your oath and your activities in the covenant. Magi are forbidden from taking Oaths of Fealty by the Hermetic Code.

**Obese**: You are large because of fat, not muscle. You are at -1 to all rolls that involve moving quickly or gracefully and at -3 to all Fatigue rolls. Your Size is +1, and so you gain one Hurt Body level. You do not gain an extra Fatigue level.

**Obligation (companions and grogs)**: You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.

**Obsessed**: You are fixated on some prized object, action, or ideal. This interferes with your accomplishment of more immediate tasks. Examples might include obsessive protection of magi to the point that you attack those who insult them, or obsessive neatness where you keep yourself spotless and deride those who do not.

**Offensive To Animals**: (companions and grogs only): You are somehow disturbing to animals. Horses do not let you ride them, and dogs growl or cower in your presence. People may well suspect you of being a wizard or Devil-worshipper.

**Oversensitive**: Something that others find merely unpleasant you consider intolerable. Examples might include an oversensitivity to disrespect, to slovenliness, or to impiety. If you are the violent type, you may start fights with those who offend you.

**Poor Armaments**: You can only have inexpensive arms and armor, and can only have inexpensive equipment relevant to your occupation.

**Poor Eyesight**: Bleary vision impedes your performance. Rolls involving sight, including rolls to attack and defend, are at $-3$. New environments are disorienting and perhaps frightening for you. This flaw can be combined with Missing Eye (above), but the penalties are cumulative.

**Poor Hearing**: Subtract 3 from rolls involving hearing. Speech that is hard for others to understand because of language, dialect, or accent is almost impossible for you to follow. You often pretend to be listening to people when in fact you are not.

**Poor Memory** (companions and grogs): You have a very hard time recalling one type of thing, such as names, faces, or places. When attempting to remember such an item, you must make a stress roll of $6+$ to succeed. You get $-3$ on any other memory-related rolls. On a botch, you recall incorrectly but are convinced you have the right information. For best effect, the storyguide should make recollection rolls secretly.

**Reclusive**: You prefer to do things on your own, and do not like being interrupted. You feel that an intrusion by another upon your time is unnecessary at best, and an insult at worst. You have a Personality Trait of Reclusive $+3$. If someone interrupts you, make a stress roll against this Trait; on a $6+$, you rudely show them the door. If you botch, you lose your temper completely, while a multiple botch likely results in violence as you try to get rid of the pest.

**Short Attention Span** (companions and grogs): You have trouble concentrating, which makes it hard to learn anything. You must earn double the normal experience points to raise your Knowledge Abilities, and expend twice as much to buy them in the first place. Keeping watch, listening to complex orders, following the plot of a story, or performing other such tasks that require continued attention are usually not within your ability.

**Simple-Minded**: You can only think about one thing at a time—guarding the bridge, hunting for a missing ring, or hiding in the trees for example. You become easily confused unless others give you very clear instructions. When unexpected circumstances pop up, you find them difficult to deal with.

**Social Handicap** (companions and grogs): You have some trait that keeps you from interacting easily with other people. This impairs your dealings with most of society, causing penalties of $-3$ on appropriate rolls. Examples include morose temperament, unworldliness, an unpleasant odor, or outspoken atheism.

**Soft-Hearted**: You cannot bear to witness suffering, and causing it brings you sleepless nights. Even the deaths of enemies are painful for you. You avoid danger and try to keep your friends out of it as well. Life and health mean so much that you would rather give up important goals than let another person risk combat. You are easily moved by song and story.

**Tainted With Evil** (magi): An air of corruption surrounds you as a result of something you, your parens, or your ancestors did. Others naturally feel very ill at ease around you, and can easily grow to hate you. Gaining a positive Reputation is impossible. Magi do not react as strongly to this attribute as normal people.

**Uncommon Fear**: Something that others find innocuous or even pleasant makes you nervous, edgy, and unable to concentrate. If you are prone to violence, you might respond by attacking or destroying the feared thing, but only if you cannot escape its presence. The object of your fear is not something you're likely to meet on a daily basis. Examples include wild animals, strange sounds, and clergy.

**Weakness**: You have a soft spot for some object or person. In the face of this, all else is unimportant: promises are forgotten, duties neglected, and common sense cast to the winds. Examples include poets and storytellers, food, flattery, or a pretty face.

**Weak-Willed**: You look to others for guidance rather than to yourself. Those who try to fool, intimidate, or manipulate you gain $+3$ to their rolls. What you need more than anything else is to find someone you can trust.

### -2 Flaws

**Clumsy**: You are not very graceful and tend to drop things—you are at a $-3$ in all related rolls. Furthermore, roll an extra botch die when taking actions related to Dexterity. Roleplay your clumsiness.

**Common Fear**: This is just like the flaw Uncommon Fear, but the thing that frightens you is more frequently encountered. Examples include fires, buildings, and the touch of others.

**Curse of Venus**: You are very attractive to people whom you do not wish to attract (add +3 to Presence rolls). People you detest keep getting crushes on you, and will not be dissuaded. Furthermore, you tend to fall in love with inappropriate people, and in inappropriate circumstances. These people you are interested in tend to think you are vain and shallow, causing a –1 penalty on Presence and Communication rolls.

**Decrepit**: You have one Decrepitude point ([see page 181](../page-refs/page-181.md)) from old wounds or a past serious illness.

**Diabolic Upbringing**: Your parents were diabolists, and though you have escaped their evil ways, you are still haunted by your upbringing and the memory of acts best left unspoken. Thoughts of demons plague you, and you live in a constant state of dread and hatred. The powers of Hell might have a special interest in your soul. You may purchase the Knowledge Occult Lore, even if you are normally not permitted to buy Arcane Knowledges.

**Haunted**: You are plagued by a ghost that only you (and those with Second Sight) can see and hear. It insults, berates, and distracts you—especially when you need to keep your cool. It might steal and hide your smaller items, give others near you the chills, or cause a buzzing in your ears that prevents you from hearing clearly. In no case, however, does the ghost have any powers when more than seven paces away from you. The storyguide should use his imagination in making the ghost irritating but not fatal. Yelling can drive the ghost away for a time, but also confuses those around you. Unless you are exceptionally strong-willed, you might have to aid the ghost in its purpose in order to be rid of it. A magus with this Flaw is haunted by a particularly powerful ghost, and therefore has trouble controlling it even with spells. It also often interferes with magical research, giving –3 to all Lab Totals.

**Hunchback (companions and grogs)**: As per the –1 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.

**Infamous**: People know you well and curse you in their prayers. You have a level 4 bad Reputation, specifying the horrible deeds that earned you such ill will.

**Lame**: One of your legs is weakened, whether since birth or through some accident. You move slowly and clumsily. Your base speed is a mere one mile per hour, and anyone can outrun you. You suffer a –6 penalty on rolls involving moving quickly or with agility, –3 on Dodge, and –1 on other combat scores.

**Lycanthrope**: You have been cursed to change form into a dangerous predator (such as a wolf, lynx, or bear) on nights of the full moon. No items or clothing transform between shapes, and it takes one full round for the full transformation to take effect. You are not immune to normal weapons, and the curse does not infect bite victims. The animal may be detected as a cursed human with a InIm 25 or equivalent spell.

You have the intelligence of a animal while changed, react to all stimuli as an animal, and do not retain any memory of actions taken in animal form, save occasionally in dreams. You may not even realize that you are under this curse. You can still recognize both friends and enemies when changed.

Lycanthropes may transform into any non-magical animal between Size –1 (wolf) and Size +2 (bear). You have the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter ([see page 252](../page-refs/page-252.md)), except that +3 is added to your Soak score (in animal form only). Furthermore, you are fully healed of all wounds incurred in animal form upon resuming human form (which happens at dawn).

**Missing Hand**: Perhaps it was an accident or a punishment in your past that cost you one of your hands. Climbing, combat, and other activities normally requiring both hands are at a penalty of –3 or greater.

**Noncombatant (magi)**: You have no interest or ability in the fighting arts. You cannot learn any Weapon Skills, and suffer –3 on all Attack and Damage scores. You may not learn combat spells (defined at storyguide discretion). You cannot pick Virtues and Flaws relating to armament quality. You may learn and engage in certámen.

**Obligation (magi)**: You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.

**Overconfident**: You have an exaggerated and unshakable opinion of your capabilities, and you do not hesitate to try things that promise only defeat. If you are convincing in your speech, you can infect others with your overconfidence. You gain the Personality Trait Overconfident at +3.

**Poor**: You have almost no wealth, and for some reason you can never seem to hang onto the valuables you do gain. You automatically begin the game with inexpensive arms and armor, and whenever you put your hands on something of value, you can bet you won’t have it for long.

**Poor (Characteristic)**: You have an exceedingly bad Characteristic—lower one which is already –3 to –4. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a feeble stature, hideous visage, or slack-jawed stupidity.

**Sheltered Upbringing**: You grew up completely separated from society, knowing only your parents or mentor. Recently you have been introduced to a wondrous new world of strangers, and you are overwhelmed. Depending on your personality, you might react with contempt, fear, or wonder. You are unable to function normally because you cannot understand most human customs. You suffer a penalty of –3 to most tasks involving social interaction, and you may have no Social Talents or Skills as beginning Abilities. Eventually you may overcome your upbringing.

**Small Frame (companions and grogs)**: You are of a lighter-than-average build. Your Size is reduced by 1. You have no Hurt Body Level and no Winded Fatigue Level.

**Tainted With Evil (companions and grogs)**: As the –1 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above. Mundanes react much more strongly to your atmosphere of corruption.

**Terrors**: Some specific thing fills you with overwhelming dread. You can do nothing but scramble and fight to flee its presence. If escape is impossible, you are likely to collapse into a quivering heap. The object of your fear is common enough that it will be encountered from time to time, but rare enough that you are not totally incapacitated. Examples include criminals, deep forests, heights, wide open spaces, and caves.

### -3 Flaws

**Arthritis**: Your joints are stiff and often painful, making almost any prolonged movement difficult. You are at –3 to rolls involving repetitive movement, sustained over time. Occasionally, the pain is so great that you are seriously disabled. On any movement or combat botch, one of your joints may “lock up,” making the limb effectively useless (–6 to all rolls involving it) until you have a chance to rest it for a day or two.

**Feral Upbringing (companions and grogs only)**: You grew up in the wilderness, either raised by wild animals or surviving on your own. For much of your life you could not speak, and knew nothing of human ways. Now that you have joined human society (or the covenant), you have learned to understand some basic spoken phrases, but civilized life is still a mystery you want little part of. You may only choose beginning Abilities that you could have learned in the wilds or picked up at the covenant (such as how to use a mace instead of a club). You have neither the inclination nor the capacity to learn more refined skills, and have no Speak or Scribe Own Language Ability.

**Fury**: A violent temper sometimes overwhelms you, sending you into a destructive, uncontrollable rage. You are likely to be provoked by some sort of specific event, such as being insulted, being hurt, or hearing the Order of Hermes disparaged. Roll 9+ on a stress die to avoid flying into a rage when such an event occurs, with another roll every round to try to calm yourself should you fail the first. On a botch, you try to kill everyone around you. While enraged you get +3 to Damage, but -1 on all other scores and rolls.

**Mute (companions and grogs only)**: You cannot speak; perhaps your tongue was cut out. You probably use rudimentary hand gestures and grunts to communicate your needs. Not only is this inconvenient, it can annoy your companions.

**Noncombatant (companions and grogs)**: As per the -2 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.

**Sense of Doom**: You have gained knowledge best left unknown—perhaps a vision of your demise or eternal fate, perhaps secrets about your true nature. At times you are listless, as nothing can shake your feeling of impending doom. Whenever you are defeated in a meaningful attempt at something, you are incapable of taking any energetic action for up to a day. If forced to defend yourself during this time, you suffer -3 on all scores.

**Small Frame (magi)**: As per the -2 Flaw of the same name for companions and grogs.

### -4 Flaws

**Dwarf (companions)**: You are the size of a child. Your comfortable walking speed is two-thirds that of a normal person. Though your muscles are mature, you lack the leverage that benefits larger folk. Even if you are strong, this prevents you from using any weapons that require a positive Strength. Your Size is -2, so you have no Winded or Weary Fatigue Levels, and have no Hurt or Lightly Wounded Body Levels.

**Feeble (Characteristic)**: You are extremely disadvantaged in one of your Characteristics—lower it from -3 to -5. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a ham-handed clumsiness, exceedingly disgusting appearance, or near-immobility.

**Plagued by (Supernatural Entity)**: You have somehow earned the enmity of a powerful ghost, an angel, a demon, or a very powerful faerie. The entity does not harass you constantly, but usually affects you in dangerous ways during important times of your life. When attempting to overcome its victim's Magic Resistance, the entity has +12 on its Penetration roll. The storyguide should decide on the nature and purpose of the entity's plans.

### -5 Flaws

**Age Quickly**: Probably due to a curse or a magical disaster, you age twice as fast as normal people. Your effective age (which applies as if it were your actual age when making longevity potions) increases two years for every year that passes, and you make two aging rolls each year. There is no way to halt or slow this other than longevity potions, and even then two potions are required to modify both aging rolls.

**Blind (companions)**: You have little or no sight. Using missile weapons is futile, reading is impossible, and navigation in unknown territory is difficult to say the least.

**Dwarf (magi)**: As the -4 Flaw for companions and grogs.

**Enfeebled (companions)**: You cannot exert yourself for longer than a few seconds. Any need for rapid movement, such as combat or a chase, leaves you helpless. Long hikes are likewise beyond your capability. You are unable to learn Weapon Skills or any other skills involving physical exertion, since you cannot train in them.

**Pathetic (Characteristic)**: You are absolutely without redeeming value in the area of one of your Characteristics. Lower a Characteristic from -3 to -5. Furthermore, the storyguide, once per session of play, may maliciously initiate some misfortune related to your shortcoming, causing you injury or embarrassment. A character with pathetic Dexterity might accidentally fall down a well, or a character with pathetic Intelligence might unknowingly cut a deal with the enemy to turn the magi over to thieves. Describe what it is about you that makes you so pathetic.

### -6 Flaws

**Enfeebled (magi)**: As per the -5 Flaw of the same name for companions, listed above. In addition, you lose double Fatigue levels from casting spells.

**Poor Memory (magi)**: As per the -1 Flaw of the same name for companions, listed above. In addition, it takes you twice as long to learn spells. You begin the saga with half the normal spell levels.
