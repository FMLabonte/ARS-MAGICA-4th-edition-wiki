# Magi

Before creating a magus character, you should have an understanding of the magic rules. Without at least a basic grasp of the way that magic works, you may make choices that will weaken your initiate magus and curtail her potential for future development.

The most basic decision you must make about your magus is which house he belongs to. A magus' house describes the magical lineage he descends from. Brief descriptions of each of the twelve houses of the Order of Hermes follow. You can refer to the Ars Magica supplement Houses of Hermes for more exhaustive information. Remember that the descriptions here are generalizations—individuals vary dramatically.

## Houses of Hermes

### House Bjornaer

Magi of Bjornaer (BYORE-nayr) concern themselves primarily with beasts and the animalistic side of human nature. Because of this emphasis in their training, each Bjornaer magus can take the form of an animal, known as his "heart-beast." Understanding the heart-beast in particular and animals in general is considered more important than Hermetic magic by many in this house.

Due to their nature, Bjornaer magi are unable to forge the necessary links to have a familiar, and the very concept is alien to them. Some Bjornaer deride magi who take famil-

iars, which they call "substitute" heart-beasts. On the other hand, other magi are wary of followers of Bjornaer because of their fascination with the bestial. Furthermore, House Bjornaer is less respected than it might otherwise be because its founder was from a Germanic rather than a Roman magical tradition.

### House Bonisagus

Bonisagus (BOH-nee-SAH-goos) invented the Hermetic theory of magic, and his student, the maga Trianoma, masterminded the formation of the Order. As such, House Bonisagus has always enjoyed a great deal of respect from other magi. Most members of this house believe themselves to be of a privileged, gifted elite.

Some Bonisagus magi refine and expand Hermetic theory, while others oversee the continued political development of the Order. Both types have a strong tradition of using their knowledge and power for the benefit of the Order. Selfishness is strongly discouraged.

### House Criamon

This very secretive house is known for its obscure philosophy, its disdain for simple power, and its members' habit of marking their faces and bodies with arcane symbols. Followers of Criamon (KREE-ah-mone) are an enigmatic and otherworldly group of magi, generally having little interest in the politics of the Order.

Magi of Criamon seek the "Enigma," which other magi characterize as some sort of mystical experience. For followers of Criamon, understanding the Enigma has a great deal to do with discovering the true nature of Wizards' Twilight and of magic itself.

### House Ex Miscellanea

This is a large, diverse, and highly disorganized collection of magi. Though originally founded by a renegade as a rival to the Order of Hermes, this association was eventually accepted as a house of its own. It accepts wizards of all kinds, many only nominally Hermetic, whose magic comes from many disparate traditions. Magi Ex Miscellanea (EKS mis-kel-LAH-nay-ah) are often called hedge wizards by their many detractors within the Order, and in fact, most of its membership originated in the peasant class.

### House Flambeau

While most followers of Flambeau (flahm-BOH) specialize in fire magic, some study spells of simple annihilation as a more subtle alternative. These aggressive and ferocious magi often cause trouble within the Order and frequently anger mundanes. However, their fearlessness and love of destruction make them invaluable when the Order requires the application of martial force.

### House Jerbiton

House Jerbiton (YARE-bih-tahn) is interested in the mundane world, and sometimes assumes the duty of keeping the Order on good terms with the nobility and Church. This inclination in its members often stems from a noble background—apprentices are usually taken from the aristocracy, and often maintain ties afterwards.

Many members of other houses believe that followers of Jerbiton are too closely bound to the mundane powers to be trusted. On the other hand, Jerbiton magi fear that members of the Order have become isolated from humanity, risking bloody conflict with the mundanes. They try energetically to heal this rift, and pursue aesthetic and Classical knowledge with a passion.

### House Mercere

The founder of this house lost his magical powers but remained involved in the Order. He assumed a non-magical role valuable to other magi—that of messenger. His followers continue to fulfill that role. All members of House Mercere (mare-KAY-ray, or mare-SARE in vulgar Latin), regardless of whether they possess the Gift, are officially recognized as magi of the Order. Even non-Gifted Mercere spend 15 years in apprenticeship like other magi.

Followers of Mercere are more commonly known as Redcaps because of the headgear they wear as a badge of office. Redcaps are permitted to attend and vote at tribunal, and are under the protection of the Hermetic Code.

<!-- new [page 19](../page-refs/page-19.md) -->
### House Merinita

This house is focused on the world of faeries, and its members tend to be just as strange as the creatures they study. Merinita (mare-ih-NEE-tah) magi frequently remain isolated, having little to do with the rest of the Order, except to defend faeries from the assaults of other magi. Those of this house eschew the merely mortal, and seek answers within the mysterious world of Arcadia.

### House Quaesitoris

Actually named House Guernicus, after its founder, this house is usually referred to as House Quaesitoris (kwy-see-TOH-riss, "investigators"). Members of this house are the judges of the Order, investigating wrongdoing and passing sentence on those who transgress the Code of Hermes and the Peripheral Code. They believe the Order will collapse through internal conflict without their fierce stewardship.

Although House Guernicus trains and inducts their own apprentices, other magi can also join their ranks. One of the highest honors in the Order is to be invited by the elders of House Guernicus to become a quaesitor. Such magi usually retain membership in their original house.

### House Tremere

Members of House Tremere (tray-MARE-ay or tray-MARE) emphasize the importance of judgment, strategy, and detailed planning. They believe in the respect of superiors and in asserting authority over minions. Dignity is of the utmost concern.

Until recently, House Tremere was considered one of the more sensible and stable Houses, providing strength and courage when needed and refraining from action when peace better served the Order. This all came to an end early in the 13th century when it was discovered that several of the highest-ranking Tremere had become vampires in a misguided attempt to gain immortality and power. All the vampiric magi were destroyed in a bloody Wizards' March.

### House Tytalus

The philosophy of Tytalus (TEU-tah-loos) magi is to master all forms of conflict. To this end, they promote innovation in all sorts of contests. They do not feel alive unless they are in a constant state of struggle, perpetually testing the strengths and weaknesses of others.

In their never-ending search for conflict, the leaders of House Tytalus went too far in the 10th century, falling prey to demonic machinations. Those masters of intrigue arrogantly believed they could master the dark forces, but despite their skill, were unable to outwit Hell. The leaders were executed for their crime of diabolism, and House Tytalus has been distrusted ever since.

### House Verditius

Magi of House Verditius (ware-DEE-tee-oos) have unsurpassed skill at creating enchanted items, making them invaluable to other magi and non-Gifted persons.

Almost all, unfortunately, have also inherited their founder's magical flaw, making them unable to cast formulaic spells without the aid of magical foci.

## House Templates

Because each house has its own style, certain Virtues and Flaws are characteristic of its members. These are set out in the descriptions below. Those designated "required" must be taken by all magi that choose that template. Some of these are unique to members of the given house, and are described at length. Those Virtues and Flaws identified as "typical" are common among members of that house, but need not be taken. You will purchase more Virtues and Flaws later in the character creation process. For now, jot down those that you have gained or chosen because of your house and move on to the next step.

Starting Abilities are also set out for each template. Record these, along with the number of experience points allotted to purchase other Abilities. Note that you can deviate from the required Virtues and Flaws, and modify the starting Abilities, with the permission of your storyguide. Storyguides should require a convincing reason rooted in the character's background for such exceptions, however.

In previous editions of Ars Magica, each magus was assumed to have a standardized set of starting Abilities that did not take into account the unique flavor of each of the Hermetic houses. If you wish, instead of using one of the house-specific templates, you may instead use this set of standard magus starting Abilities, listed below. If your saga is set in Mythic Europe, you are still a member of one of the twelve houses. You should choose which one, but do not use any of the specifications from the house templates in this section.

**Standard Magus Starting Abilities:** Hermes Lore 2, Magic Theory 5, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Standard Magus Starting Experience Points:** 3 + age

### House Bjornaer

**Starting Abilities:** Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 4, Speak Own Language 4, Will Over Form 1 (see below)

**Starting Experience Points:** 15 + age

The animal nature of Bjornaer magi gives their magic a unique flavor. Because of this, they have a house-specific Virtue, Follower of Bjornaer.

**Required Virtue:**

**Follower of Bjornaer (variable):** This Virtue is a combination of the effects listed below. Its cost is dependent upon the nature of your heart-beast. If your heart-beast is battleworthy (such as a wolf, a stag, or a bear), the cost of this Virtue is +2. Otherwise, it is +1. Some rare apprentices can take the shape of an inanimate object, called a "heart-shape." Heart-shapes are always natural objects, not manufactured or constructed objects. Possessing a heart-shape makes the basic cost of this Virtue +1.

- **Heart-Beast:** You have a heart-beast, an animal form you can take at any time without casting a spell. Your master probed your heart to see what shape lay within, making it more a matter of your intrinsic nature than conscious choice. Over time, your human form takes on more and more aspects of your heart-beast, including personality and physical shape. You have a Personality Trait named after the form you take, starting at +1. The score may get higher as you go through the saga, at the storyguide's discretion. The higher the score, the more closely attuned to the shape you are, and the more strongly you identify with it.
- **Hidden Shape:** Hermetic magi cannot perceive your heart-beast. Spells such as Sight of the True Form reveal your current form (whether your current form is your heart-beast or some other shape adopted through a spell) as though it were your natural shape. Magic of other kinds, such as faerie magic, might detect your heart-beast, at the storyguide's discretion.
- **No Familiar:** As per the -1 Hermetic Flaw described on [page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).
- **Will Over Form:** This is a Talent unique to Bjornaer magi. You start with this Ability at level 1 and may raise it by spending experience points. It reflects your expertise at controlling the shape you take, and gives you a bonus to resist spells that change your appearance. When attempting to resist spells of transformation or when attempting to regain one of your normal shapes, roll a stress die + Stamina + Will Over Form. A roll of 9+ means you succeed.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Special Circumstances (+1): You receive a bonus to magic rolls while in wild, uninhabited lands. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Gentle Gift (+1): Your connection to animals lets them be comfortable around you. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Blatant Gift (-1): Your parens has drawn magic from deep within you; non-magical beings are highly disturbed by your presence. [See page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md).
- Magic Deficiency with Ignem (variable): Bjornaer, the founder of the House, never learned this Art well, and her deficiency has been passed from master to apprentice for hundreds of years. Most Bjornaer magi have this weakness—apparently something about their training makes learning fire magic difficult. [See page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md).
- Stingy Master (-2): Your master focused on the peculiar interests of Bjornaer magic more than Hermetic training, and as a result you do not have the firm grounding in magical theory that other apprentices receive. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).

### House Bonisagus

**Starting Abilities:** Magic Theory 5, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 3, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** Equal to age

Because of the high esteem in which the founder of this house is held among magi, followers of Bonisagus enjoy special status.

**Required Virtue:**

- Hermetic Prestige (+1): As a member of House Bonisagus, you are accorded respect among magi. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Magical Affinity (variable): Your master encouraged you to excel in a specialty so that you could bring new insights to House Bonisagus. Fellow magi in the house expect you to push this specialty to its limit. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Book-Learner (+1): [See page 40](../page-refs/page-40.md).
- Inventive Genius (+1): [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Knack with Magic Theory: Due to this house's scholarly interests, apprentices receive excellent training. [See page 40](../page-refs/page-40.md).
- Blatant Gift (-1): Your intense involvement with magic has made you noticeably different. [See page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md).
- Driving Goal (-1): You are determined to become the unchallenged expert in your particular magical specialty. [See page 47](../page-refs/page-47.md).
- Obese (-1): Life in a laboratory has left you flabby. [See page 47](../page-refs/page-47.md).
- Magic Deficiency (variable): In the mind of a follower of Bonisagus, a magus who excels at a specific type of magic is much more valuable than a generalist. You can spend your entire life exploring the magic that you are good at, so there is no need for you to be able to do everything. You focused so strongly on your magical specialty during apprenticeship that your master neglected to correct difficulties you had in other areas. [See page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md).

### House Criamon

**Starting Abilities:** Enigmatic Wisdom 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 10 + age

Criamon magi's constant pursuit of the Enigma leaves them altered and strange in the eyes of others. Most typical Virtues and Flaws for this House reflect this tendency.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Cursed (variable): Delving into your own magic has caused you some damage, which could be the equivalent of a curse. [See page 46](../page-refs/page-46.md).
- Knack with Enigmatic Wisdom: You have special insight, and gain the insights of others easily. [See page 40](../page-refs/page-40.md).
- Magical Affinity (Mentem, Imáginem, or Intéllego) (variable): More precise affinities, such as with ghosts, are also common among Criamon magi. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Strong Personality (+1): Lack of social contact has allowed your personal traits to grow unchecked. [See page 42](../page-refs/page-42.md).
- Blatant Gift (-1): Your magical nature is strong and evident; the quest to understand the Enigma has left its mark upon you. [See page 35](../page-refs/page-35.md).
- Disfigured (-1): Arcane symbols tattooed on your face give you a bizarre appearance. [See page 47](../page-refs/page-47.md).
- Obsessed (-1): You may be obsessed with something related tangentially or symbolically to your quest for knowledge, or you may simply be a bit off balance. [See page 48](../page-refs/page-48.md).
- Stingy Master (-2): Your master concentrated on unraveling the Enigma over teaching you magic theory. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).
- Twilight Points (-1): The mystical pursuits of Criamon magi often plunge them into Wizards' Twilight. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).

### House Ex Miscellanea

**Starting Abilities:** Magic Theory 3, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 1, Speak Latin 3, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 29 + age

Magi Ex Miscellanea usually come from some sort of subset that describes their master's specific tradition. Once you have decided on a group that you belong to within the House, pick Virtues and Flaws that will help fit your style of magic to that group. Some examples, by no means exhaustive, are listed below.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

**BEAST MAGE**

Beast mages have a strong bond with animals, and are adept at communicating with and controlling them. They often share the peculiarities of the beasts they work with, and are often skilled at shapechanging. Beast mages share much in common with Followers of Bjornaer, but nevertheless belong to House Ex Miscellanea.

- Affinity with Familiars (+1): [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Affinity with Animál (+3): [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).

**SPIRIT MASTER**

These magi excel in summoning, communicating with, and controlling creatures of other realms. They learn many secrets from conferring with ghosts, demons and the like, and are often driven by their desire to know even more.

- Affinity with Spirit Creatures (+2): This bonus applies to all spells that directly involve elementals, magical beasts, ghosts, and other magical beings. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Obsessed (-1): You thirst for ever greater knowledge of the worlds beyond, to the point of attempting to control what is beyond your ability. [See page 48](../page-refs/page-48.md).

The Symbol of House Ex Miscellanea

### House Flambeau

**Starting Abilities:** Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 13 + age

The fiery bent of Flambeau magi is associated with fairly obvious affinities and defects. They often have character flaws like quick tempers and aggressive natures.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Affinity with Ignem (+3): [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Affinity with Perdo (+4): [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Infamous Master (-1): Your master's rage got him or her into serious trouble, and other magi anticipate the same in you. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).
- Stingy Master (-2): Your master traveled and campaigned too much to teach you consistently. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).

### House Jerbiton

**Starting Abilities:** Etiquette 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 9 + age

The continual involvement of Jerbiton magi with the mundane world requires both the nature and the skills necessary to interact well with normal people. Members of this House often specialize in temporal pursuits, such as art, philosophy, and diplomacy.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Free Expression (+1): This is appropriate if you are an artist. [See page 41](../page-refs/page-41.md).
- Gentle Gift (+1): You were chosen as an apprentice in part because your magical talent is not noticeable to others. Otherwise you would have problems fitting into society. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Well-Traveled (+1): Many magi of this House are especially familiar with cities. [See page 43](../page-refs/page-43.md).
- Noncombatant (-2): Most followers of Jerbiton are philosophers rather than warriors. [See page 49](../page-refs/page-49.md).

### House Mercere

**Gifted Mercere Starting Abilities:** Magic Theory 3, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 3, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Gifted Mercere Starting Experience Points:** 9 + age

**Non-Gifted Mercere Starting Abilities:** Hermes Lore 3, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4, Survival 1, Weapon Class (choose one) 2

**Non-Gifted Mercere Starting Experience Points:** 14 + age

As shown above, when generating a member of House Mercere, you must choose whether the character has the Gift or not. Even Mercere without the Gift are recognized as full members of the Order of Hermes.

At the storyguide's option, non-Gifted Mercere may occupy a player's companion slot, allowing that player to play a Gifted magus in addition to the Redcap. In such a case, the Mercere should still be generated according to the rules for magi (though will obviously receive no magical training).

**Required Virtue:**

- **Redcap (+1):** You are a messenger of the Order of Hermes. You may be assigned to one covenant or may wander among several, delivering messages. In exchange for your services, you receive a moderate stipend during each visit (typically 4 silver pennies), a few days to rest, and are shown high hospitality. You possess a sigil, and have all the privileges of membership in the Order.

Most common folk do not harass or harm Redcaps for fear of bringing the wrath of the Order down upon them. Even magi think twice before interfering with your mission. This gives you a high degree of protection when you travel, even if you are alone.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Well-Traveled (+1): [See page 43](../page-refs/page-43.md).
- Jack-of-All-Trades (+2): A life on the road brings many new experiences. [See page 43](../page-refs/page-43.md).

### House Merinita

**Starting Abilities:** Faerie Lore 1, Faerie Magic 1 (see below), Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 4, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 13 + age

The involvement of followers of Merinita with the faerie world gives them a deep affinity with unearthly forms of magic.

**Required Virtue:**

- **Faerie Magic (+1):** This allows you to have a unique Arcane Talent, Faerie Magic, which you purchase along with your other Abilities and improve with experience points. Add your score in this Ability to rolls resisting faerie magic and to rolls when casting faerie magic spells that you learn or invent. The higher your score in this Ability, though, the more strange and like the fey you become.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Faerie Blood (variable): An ancestor was one of the Good Folk; this may be the source not only of your Gift, but also your fascination with all things faerie. [See page 39](../page-refs/page-39.md).
- Magical Animal Companion (+2): Your master took you on journeys through faerie lands, and on one of these visits you befriended a supernatural creature of some type. To turn it into a Familiar would be to deprive it of some of its freedom, so you might not wish to do so. [See page 44](../page-refs/page-44.md).
- Cursed (variable): Encounters with dark or exceptionally powerfully faeries may have left you with unfortunate defects. [See page 46](../page-refs/page-46.md).
- Clumsy Magic (−2): Faerie influence has made your magic a bit more difficult to control than is normal. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).

### House Quaesitoris

**Starting Abilities:** Hermetic Law 2, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 5 + age

As enforcers of the laws that bind the Order, quaesitores bear a heavy responsibility. This is both an honor and a burden, and the Virtues and Flaws of this House tend to reflect this.

**Required Virtue:**

- **Quaesitor (+1):** Out of deference to your position, you are respected by other members of the Order—although not necessarily liked. [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Affinity with Divination Magic (variable): The nature of your specialty could be as broad as a magical Art (such as Intéllego) or a specific area (such as seeing the past). [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).
- Clear Thinker (+1): The duties of a quaesitor demand rigorous mental training. [See page 41](../page-refs/page-41.md).
- Higher Purpose (+1): Guiding the Order in following its Code is an important cause to you and gives you strength in hard times. [See page 41](../page-refs/page-41.md).
- Dutybound (−1): Your devotion to your calling can verge on the fanatical. [See page 47](../page-refs/page-47.md).

### House Tremere

**Starting Abilities:** Certámen 2, Intrigue 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes 2), Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 4 + age

House Tremere is founded on order, pure and uncompromising. This has its benefits, for it encourages logic and careful planning. On the other hand, it also stifles individuality and promotes a certain rigidity of thought.

**Required Flaw:**

- **No Sigil (−1):** Your sigil (the symbol of your membership in the Order of Hermes) is held by your parens. You cannot vote at tribunal, and the holder of your sigil can call on you to perform tasks or missions. Any filii you have do not hold their sigils until you possess your own. You must defeat the holder of your sigil in certámen to claim your right.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

- Self-Confident (variable): You have been taught that you are superior to the vast majority of humanity and that House Tremere is superior to the other Houses of Hermes. [See page 42](../page-refs/page-42.md).
- Strong-Willed (+1): The motto of House Tremere is “Will conquers all.” [See page 42](../page-refs/page-42.md).
- Knack with Certámen: This represents the special techniques you have learned and the early practice you received. [See page 40](../page-refs/page-40.md).

<!-- End of page-21-25.md -->


<!-- Start of page-26-30.md -->

### House Tytalus

**Starting Abilities:** Intrigue 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

**Starting Experience Points:** 10 + Age

The preoccupation of Tytalus magi with conflict manifests itself in common physical and psychological quirks.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

**Driving Goal (–1):** The constant quest for challenges drives you to prove yourself against all worthy opponents. [See page 47](../page-refs/page-47.md).

**Tormenting Master (–1):** Your master does not believe that you have successfully passed the apprentice’s gauntlet yet, and may continue to challenge you. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).

<!-- new [page 21](../page-refs/page-21.md) -->
<!-- new [page 24](../page-refs/page-24.md) -->
### House Verditius

**Starting Abilities:** Magic Theory 5, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4, Verditius Magic 1 (see below)

**Starting Experience Points:** 7 + Age

Verditius magi, with their dependence on physical devices to cast formulaic spells, are limited in many ways. They have compensated, though, by becoming masters of artifact creation, and their services are in high demand among both magi and important non-Gifted persons. Verditius magi have no problems dealing with Arcane Skills, spontaneous spells, Parma Magica or certámen.

**Required Flaws:**

**Follower of Verditius (–1):** Your magic requires the use of small devices called casting tools. These must simply be held and focused on as the spell is cast in order for it to work. Verditius magi still must use gestures and words as other magi do. Each spell known requires a separate tool. The creation of casting tools is included in the time is takes Verditius magi to learn spells.

You also have a unique Arcane Skill, called Verditius Magic, reflecting your special aptitude at crafting magic items, which you may improve with experience points. Add this Ability score to your Lab total when creating magical devices, including longevity potions.

**Typical Virtues and Flaws:**

**Inventive Genius (+1)** [See page 34](../page-refs/page-34.md).

**Clumsy Magic (–2):** Despite centuries of practice, casting spells is still a bit tricky for many Verditius magi. [See page 36](../page-refs/page-36.md).
