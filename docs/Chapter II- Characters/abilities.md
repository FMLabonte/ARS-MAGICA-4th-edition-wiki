# Abilities

Abilities represent what a character can do beyond the basic functions described by Characteristics. They usually represent training or practice in the way that Characteristics represent innate capacity. Abilities are broken down into Skills, Talents, and Knowledges based on the different ways that they can be improved. Skills, Talents, and Knowledges are broken down further into related groups such as Arcane Skills or Formal Knowledges. Each Ability is assigned a score, representing the character's level of expertise. In general, an Ability score of 3 suggests basic competence, 5 represents professional mastery, and scores of 9 or higher suggest folk who are approaching the pinnacle of human knowledge and achievement.

It is possible to gain special Abilities that are not mentioned specifically in these descriptions. These are referred to as Exceptional Abilities. Usually, they are gained by purchasing specific Virtues. They function and improve just like the Abilities listed here. They are not described in this section because they are only available to characters who select the appropriate Virtue. A reference is provided to assist you in finding the rules that cover these special Abilities.

## Using Abilities

An Ability score modifies a die roll when a character attempts an action that it governs. Generally you will add your character's score in the appropriate Ability to your score in one Characteristic to the roll of a die. Often times, other modifiers will also apply based on the specific circumstances of the action. The Characteristic chosen depends on how the Ability is used. For example, Athletics is usually used in combination with either Stamina, Dexterity, or Quickness. In a situation where your character is attempting to leap over a chasm, you would apply your Athletics score and your Dexterity score. On the other hand, when running a foot race, you would sum your Athletics and Quickness.

The Storyguide determines the ease of success in given tasks by assigning ease factors. When using an Ability against a static force the ease factor is based on the difficulty of the task. For example, when attempting to pick a lock, the ease factor would be based on the quality of the lock. When the attempt is opposed by another person's actions both roll and compare results. The higher total usually wins, but the storyguide must take into account any other modifiers that apply, such as Encumbrance, Virtues and Flaws, or special circumstances.

The storyguide decides whether the roll is a stress or simple die. If your character is feeling pressured and is likely to make mistakes or do exceptionally well as a result, the roll is stress. The storyguide can also set a minimum Ability score that must be met even to attempt certain rolls.

You may not always be aware of the reasons for rolling, the modifiers to your rolls, or the results of success or failure. In situations where your character does not know what is going on, the storyguide may simply roll on your behalf and announce the results.

If your character attempts an action covered by an Ability that he does not have, there are three possible procedures. For Talents (except Exceptional Talents—[see page 59](../page-refs/page-59.md)), roll a stress die modified only by the appropriate Characteristic, with three additional botch dice if you roll a 0. For Skills, you receive a -3 penalty to your stress roll as well as three extra botch rolls. Where the action requires a Knowledge, you cannot even make the attempt. (When the action in question is governed by a Casual Knowledge, the storyguide might give your character a chance to recognize something that is commonly known.)

## Choosing Abilities

You purchase your character's initial allotment of Abilities with starting experience points representing the amount of learning and practical knowledge your character has picked up so far in his life. Companions and grogs start with a number of experience points equal to twice their age. They may purchase Abilities as they see fit, though if you are using a vocation template, a list of suggestions is provided.

Starting experience points for magi are determined by their house affiliation—see the "Conceptualization" section on pages 21-26 for the exact total for any given magus character. If you are creating a magus, your house template includes a list of starting Abilities. These have already been paid for—simply record them as they are written. As mentioned above, your template also includes a number of experiences points that you may spend at your discretion, either

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

purchasing new Abilities or increasing the levels of your starting Abilities.

As a person grows more skilled or knowledgeable, it becomes harder to improve on that training; more experience points are required to raise an Ability of 3 up to a 4 than to increase a 1 to a 2. Hence, Abilities are purchased on a pyramid system. In order to raise an Ability to the next level, you must pay a number of experience points equal to the score you wish to attain. For example, to raise a score of 0 to a score of 1 costs one experience point. To raise a score of 4 to a score of 5 requires five experience points. The Ability Cost Table below is a summary of this system, recording the total number of experience points required to bring your score from 0 to a given number.

Be sure that the Abilities you choose make sense for your character's identity, especially those related to his profession, background and culture. If you are using a vocation template, suggestions are spelled out there. In general, however, grogs should choose the Abilities they need to be warriors, guards, and servants. Typically these include good Weapon Class scores, Awareness, Survival, or Chirurgy. Companions generally have high scores in Abilities related to their specialty, whatever that is. Magi should make sure to purchase Arcane Abilities such as Finesse, Concentration, and Penetration, which are often as important as spells themselves. All characters should have the linguistic proficiency necessary to communicate with other characters.

<!-- new [page 51](../page-refs/page-51.md) -->
### Specializations

Similar to Characteristics, each Ability you select for your character should be assigned a specialization. While specializations for Characteristics have no mechanical effect, Ability specializations do. When you are using an Ability in a way that incorporates your specialization, you act as if your score were one level higher than it actually is. For example, if you have the skill Single Weapon 3, with the specialization longsword, you act as if your Single Weapon was 4 when using longswords.

|  Starting Experience Points  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Magi | Defined by house affiliation  |
|  Companion | 2 x age  |
|  Grog | 2 x age  |

Suggested specializations for each Ability are listed in italics at the end of each description. Other specializations are possible with the permission of your storyguide.

### Ability Descriptions

The Ability descriptions below tell what actions that Ability covers, from the character's point of view, example-specializations, and (in parentheses) the Characteristics most often used with it.

Ability descriptions are general because they categorize human endeavor, something that is not easily divided into discrete units. You may not know which of your character's Abilities applies to a situation. As a rule of thumb, if an action is covered by one Ability, a different Ability does not apply. When in doubt, ask your storyguide.

If your character needs an Ability that is not described here and the storyguide approves, invent it yourself.

#### Talents

Talents are untrained but intuitive capabilities. They can only be improved through actual use, usually on adventures.

<!-- new [page 52](../page-refs/page-52.md) -->
##### Arcane Talents

These talents can only be possessed by characters with magical abilities.

|  Ability Cost Table  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Desired Skill Level | Experience Point Cost  |
|  1 | 1  |
|  2 | 3  |
|  3 | 6  |
|  4 | 10  |
|  5 | 15  |
|  6 | 21  |
|  7 | 28  |
|  8 | 36  |
|  9 | 45  |
|  10 | 55  |

**Finesse**: Manipulating your spells and performing special feats with them. You would use this Ability to position objects delicately or to target spells. Specialties: grace, precision, any one Form. (Perception)

**Penetration**: Getting your spell through the target's magic resistance. Generally, you add your Ability score to your spellcasting roll and compare the total to the target's magic resistance roll. Specialties: any one Art. (n/a)

##### General Talents

General Talents are available to anyone and cover common areas of ability.

**Athletics**: General physical prowess. It includes moving smoothly, confidently, and with grace. Use of Athletics improves most large-muscle coordination. Specialties: acrobatics, contortions, grace, jumping, running. (Stamina, Dexterity, Quickness)

**Awareness**: Noticing things, be they things you are looking for or things that you are not aware of. It is also used to see how alert you are in circumstances that require watchfulness. Specialties: bodyguarding, keeping watch, alertness, searching. (Perception)

**Charm**: Enticing, fascinating, and endearing others to you, but only on a personal basis. It can be used to win someone over emotionally, especially members of the opposite sex. Specialties: courtly love, first impressions, being witty. (Presence)

**Climb**: Climbing all manner of difficult surfaces. Specialized equipment is necessary for more difficult ascents. A botch usually means a fall. Specialties: cliffs, trees, walls and buildings. (Dexterity, Strength)

**Concentration**: Focusing your mental faculties on one task, particularly for extended periods of time. If you are attempting a feat that demands your extra attention, or if you have just failed an action and are trying again, the Storyguide can call for a Concentration roll before you can make the attempt. This Ability is especially important for magi because it helps them maintain concentration on spells despite distractions. Specialties: spell concentration, reading, lab work. (Stamina, Intelligence)

**Folk Ken**: Understanding the background, personality, and motives of another person. Often the storyguide secretly rolls a die when this Ability is used. Thus, you do not know if your character guessed correctly, or even botched. Specialties: peasants, townsfolk, nobles, clergy, magi, the opposite sex. (Intelligence, Perception)

**Guile**: Telling convincing lies, as well as feigning emotion, belief, or frame of mind. If you understand the person you are attempting to deceive (roll 9+ on Perception + Folk Ken), you may gain a bonus to your Guile roll. Specialties: lying to authority, fast talk, elaborate lies. (Communication, Perception)

#### Skills

Skills are trained or self-taught Abilities. You can increase them through instruction or direct experience.

<!-- new [page 54](../page-refs/page-54.md) -->
##### Academic Skills

Academic Skills require formal training and cannot be learned without a skilled teacher. If you have not acquired an appropriate background through the purchase of a Virtue, you can acquire these skills only by finding a willing teacher through role-play.

**Disputatio**: Disputatio is the skill of participating in formal debate. In the medieval period this is used as a teaching technique as well as a technique of debate. A disputation is a formal event. One person proposes a thesis, and gives one or more arguments in its favor. Another person rebuts those arguments, and proposes arguments against the thesis. The first person responds, and the process continues until either a decision is reached or everyone gets bored. Disputatio is only useful in a formal situation, and its use will only impress the educated. It is quite useful as a one-on-one teaching method. Specialties: debate, teaching. (Communication)

**Lectio**: Lectio is the skill of teaching from a text—reading the text aloud and commenting on it, either to clarify or to extend the meaning. This skill only covers oral presentation—written presentation is covered by the Scribe skill. It is used primarily for teaching a group of students. Specialties: specific types of texts. (Communication)

**Scribe (Language)**: The Scribe skill covers the basic ability to read and write, and also the ability to compose a letter, charter, or book. In Western Europe, the Roman alphabet is used for most languages. Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic script are used in other areas. Scribe skill must be purchased separately for each language or alphabet you wish to be proficient in. Specialties: copying, illumination, original composition. (Intelligence)

##### Combat Skills

Combat Skills are separated into different Weapon Classes. You take a separate skill for each Weapon Class you wish to use. If your character is a combatant, it is highly recommended that you take combat skill in the class "Brawl," as this includes the ability to dodge blows. Also, you should note that each Weapon Class is a separate discipline—knowing Shield and Weapon (for example) does not help you use Single Weapon at all, and vice versa. Because of this, you may want to purchase scores in multiple weapon classes, just in case you're caught without your primary choice.

Each Weapon Class is described below. Each class has specialties including the specific types of weapons it covers. For example, Single Weapon would include the specialties shortsword, longsword, mace, and others.

**Brawling**: Brawling covers fist fighting, using knives and daggers, and improvising weapons. It also covers the ability to dodge incoming blows.

**Single Weapon**: Using clubs, maces, shortswords, and other one-handed weapons.

**Shield and Weapon**: The use of a single weapon (as described above) and a shield of any type.

**Two Weapons**: The skill of using two single weapons, one in each hand. This includes Florentine style, double ax, and many other combinations.

**Great Weapon**: Covers greatswords, claymores, some poleaxes, and other weapons requiring the use of two hands.

**Chain Weapon**: Using morning stars, flails, and other flexible weapons.

**Longshaft Weapon**: These are spears, lances, and polearms which have long shafts and the killing point on one end.

**Thrown Weapon**: Includes slings, rocks, axes, daggers, and other objects hurled at an opponent.

**Bows**: Training in the use of recurved bows, self bows, long bows, and other non-mechanically stringed bowshafts.

**Crossbows**: The use of mechanically drawn bows. They fire short-fletched quarrels with penetration better than most other bows.

**Siege Equipment**: The operation and knowledge of arbalests, catapults, and other very long range or heavy load trajectory equipment.

##### Hermetic Skills

Hermetic Skills may only be purchased by magi of the Order of Hermes.

**Certámen**: Fighting magical duels. Add your score in this Skill to your rolls in certámen ([see page 78](../page-refs/page-78.md)). Specialties: Any single Art. (Intelligence)

**Parma Magica**: Protection from magic. This is a special ritual (not a ritual spell) that takes about a minute to perform. It lets you add 5 times your Parma Magica score to magic resistance rolls until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. You may also protect one other person for each point in Parma Magica, but the score is effectively modified by $-3$ (so you need a score of $4+$ to do any good at all). You may cancel the effect at will. Specialties: protection from any specific Form. (n/a)

##### Performance Skills

**Jongleur**: Covers the skills it takes to be a professional, all-purpose entertainer and minstrel of the Middle Ages. This includes juggling, showy acrobatics, and slapstick humor. Jongleurs can be found in both marketplaces and noble courts—some even frequent the homes of wizards. This sort of amusement is often very coarse; troubadours supply the more serious poetic and musical entertainment. Specialties: jester, juggling, insults. (Communication, Dexterity)

**Play (Instrument)**: Performing with a certain instrument and familiarity with a repertoire of music appropriate to it. When you purchase this skill, choose a specific instrument. You may purchase this skill more than once in order to learn a variety of different instruments. Specialties: solo, ensemble, vast repertoire. (Dexterity, Communication)

**Sing**: Singing well, and knowing a repertoire of songs. Everyone can sing after a fashion, but this Skill indicates a level of competence such that others enjoy listening to your voice. Specialties: solo, ensemble, ballads, war songs. (Communication)

**Storytelling**: Choosing an appropriate tale from your repertoire (which grows with your score) and telling it well. Masters of the art can recite different stories for weeks without repeating themselves. Specialties: poems, epics, romances, improvisation. (Communication)

##### Rogue Skills

**Disguise**: The know-how to mimic other people or to fit into the crowd by adopting special clothes, appearance, voice and behavior. Roll Perception + Disguise to convey an image (add +3 if using a model); observers make a similar roll, comparing it to yours to see through the disguise. Each party modifies the roll by -3 for an unfamiliar person or +3 for a well-known person. Specialties: nobles, magi, clergy, peasants. (Perception)

**Forgery**: Forging documents and wax seals. Scribe helps but is not always a requirement—the storyguide must be the judge of when Scribe is required. Successful reproduction of a person's handwriting and style is tricky—it takes a roll of $12+$ to forge a missive from a baron to his loyal vassal, but only if you have a sample letter. Specialties: legal documents, seals. (Communication, Intelligence)

**Legendemain**: Sleight of hand and knowledge of confidence games requiring sleight of hand. It requires a delicate touch and great hand-eye coordination. Legendemain includes filching things from market stalls and cutting purses, as well as the "magical" trickery often used to raise money from credulous folk. The target of an attempt rolls Perception + Awareness to detect your actions. If the perceiver has Legendemain skill, he may substitute that for Awareness if he wishes. On particularly delicate moves such as picking pockets, he receives a +3 bonus. Specialties: filching, picking pockets, "magic" tricks. (Dexterity, Quickness)

**Pick Locks**: Opening locked things without the convenience of a key, usually without the permission of the owner. Certain locks are so intricate that a minimum skill level is required even to make the attempt, but these are very rare. Most medieval locks are much larger, bulkier, and simpler than their modern counterparts. Specialties: speed, avoiding traps, in darkness. (Dexterity)

**Stealth**: Sneaking about without being seen or heard, also hiding in one place. This includes following people without their noticing, which is rolled against the other person's Perception. Specialties: hide, sneak, shadowing, urban areas, natural areas. (Dexterity)

##### Social Skills

**Bargain**: The know-how to get the greatest return for a service or product, while paying the least. It involves reading the person with whom you haggle, a general knowledge of the value of goods, and presenting yourself in certain ways. A good haggler can easily overcome resistance in an inexperienced customer and see through attempts to overvalue most merchandise. Specialties: specific types of products, hard sell. (Presence, Communication)

### Carouse
The ability to enjoy oneself without suffering adverse effects. A person with this skill can, for example, consume prodigious amounts of alcohol without passing out. The skill also covers a familiarity with acceptable behavior, balancing enjoyment and moderation. With this Skill, a person is able to have fun and gain friends among the lower classes nearly anywhere, even among those of a different culture. Specialties: power drinking, drinking songs, games of chance, staying sober. (Stamina, Communication)

### Etiquette
You know the social graces and how to behave in different situations. Successful Etiquette rolls might also grant you bonuses on rolls for Social Talents or other Social Skills. Specialties: nobility, court, peasants, faeries, the Church. (Presence, Communication)

### Intrigue
Dealing and plotting, including subtle use of power in non-confrontational ways to achieve your own ends. Intrigue need not be underhanded or manipulative—it also cover negotiations and knowledge of formal and informal rules of conduct and politeness. In addition, Intrigue also allows a character to pick up important information about those in power, separating fact from useless gossip. Intrigue is a vital talent for those who frequent court or a Hermetic tribunal. Specialties: gossip, plotting, rumormongering, alliances. (Presence, Communication, Perception)

### Leadership
Getting people to obey your orders and to follow you. Can also be used to inspire fear in others, cowing them into submission. Specialties: magi, mercenaries, bandits, armies, intimidation, grogs. (Presence)

## Wilderness Skills

### Animal Handling
Care and use of animals, including raising, tending, grooming, and healing them. Specialties: falconry, specific animals. (Intelligence, Perception)

### Hunt
Setting snares, choosing appropriate hunting spots, and following and identifying the spoor of creatures of all varieties. This Ability also lets you cover your tracks or not leave any in the first place. Specialties: tracking, covering tracks, hunting a specific animal. (Perception)

### Ride
Riding and controlling a horse, especially under stress. Specialties: battle, speed, tricks. (Dexterity, Strength)

### Survival
Finding food, water, shelter, a direct route, and relative safety in the wilderness (a very dangerous place in Mythic Europe). This Ability covers such mundane tasks as building a fire and cooking food without implements. Specialties: specific locales. (Perception, Intelligence)

### Swim
The ability to propel yourself through water quickly and efficiently. Specialties: long distances, diving, underwater maneuvering. (Dexterity)

## Work Skills

### Boating
Handling small craft of all types, vital for most fishing. Specialties: repairs, storms, fishing. (Dexterity)

### Chirurgy (kie-RUHR-gee)
This is Middle Ages-style surgery, used to help others recover from physical damage. It encompasses tending and binding wounds of all varieties, and the necessary but brutal skill of cauterization. Specialties: cauterization, diagnosis, binding wounds, setting bones. (Intelligence, Dexterity)

### Craft (Type)
A general term for countless Skills, all dealing with handiwork of some type. Some sample crafts: baking, blacksmith, bowmaking, carpentry, chandlery, clothiery, cooperage, embalming, engineering, fishing, glassworking, goldsmith, hideworking, jewelworking, leathercraft, locksmith, masonry, milling, perfumery, portraiture, pottery, sculpting, shipbuilding, silversmith, smelting, weaponry, winemaking, woodworking. You may purchase Craft more than once, choosing a different one each time. Skill in one Craft does not imply skill in any others. Feel free to make up your own Craft if it does not appear in this list. Specialties: as appropriate to the craft. (Intelligence, Dexterity)

### Wagoneering
Handling carts and wagons of all kinds, vital for trade and most farming. Specialties: speed, repair, rough terrain. (Dexterity)

## Knowledges
Knowledges are Abilities that require application of the mind rather than the body, so they almost always use Intelligence as a modifier. Many activities that 20th-century people take for granted, such as counting and reading, are not common among medieval folk.

You usually use stress rolls for Knowledges, even when your character is not under pressure. This simulates variable recollection: while someone with limited knowledge is unlikely to have picked up little-known facts, a very knowledgeable person might still miss a few bits of information.

Knowledges can be increased through direct experience, training, or study.

<!-- new [page 56](../page-refs/page-56.md) -->
### Academic Knowledges
Academic Knowledges require formal university training. Beginning characters may only purchase Academic Knowledges if they are magi or are specifically permitted through the purchase of a Virtue. In addition, learning an Academic Knowledges requires a Speak Latin score of at least 3, as all of them are taught in Latin.

Medieval study is based on the auctores, or authorities, in each subject. These auctores are not regarded as infallible or as having said all of what there is to be said on a subject. They are, however, supposed to have gotten the essentials right and to have accurately divided the subject into its categories. Thus, a medieval scholar might suggest that Aristotle was wrong about a certain kind of logical fallacy, but he would not suggest that Aristotle was completely wrong about logic or that there were fallacies that did not fall under any of his classifications.

#### Artes Liberales
The seven artes liberales, or liberal arts, are the basis of medieval higher education. Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other academic knowledge without a score of at least three in this one.

The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)

Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The auctores are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the auctor, in his *logica vetus* and *logic nova*. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The auctor is Cicero, especially his *De Inventione*.

Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The auctor is Boethius, *De arithmetica*. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the auctor is Euclid, in his *Elementa*. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's *Optica* is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the auctor is Ptolemy, in the *Libri Almagesti*. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in *De Musica*. Specialties: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music. (Intelligence)

#### Civil and Canon Law
Civil Law is the law of the Roman Empire. Most local legal systems are based upon it (England being the notable exception), and when a law is needed to govern international relations, Civil Law is appealed to. The authority is Justinian's Digest. Canon Law is the law of the Church. It is important to Mythic Europe as it applies in all nations, governing the working of the church and some other areas, such as marriage. It is important to note that members of the clergy are only subject to canon law, not customary or civil law. Most high churchmen are skilled canonists, not theologians. Canon Law is made by Papal bulls (pronouncements), but the auctor is Gratian, in his *Decretum*. This skill covers the knowledge of both types of law. Specialties: laws and customs of a specific area, papal laws. (Intelligence)

#### Medicine
Medicine is the formal study of the body and its diseases. Medical practice is based on the theory of the four humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Diseases are believed to be caused by imbalances among them, hence such practices as bloodletting, to restore the balance. The auctores are Galen and Hippocrates, in many works. Medicine may be used in the place of Chirurgy, by an individual so trained. Specialties: anatomy, apothecary, physician. (Intelligence)

#### Philosophiae
There are three philosophies—natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. Aristotle is the auctor for all of them, in different books. Most scholars study the philosophies after the Arts but before going on to Law, Theology or Medicine. Natural philosophy is the study of the sub-lunar world. It roughly corresponds to today's science. The main texts are the Physica, De Meteorologia, and De historia animalium. Moral philosophy is the study of the proper way of human life. It covers ethics, politics, and economics—the texts are the Ethica, Politica, and Economica. Metaphysics is the philosophy of the fundamental nature of the world. The main text is Aristotle's Metaphysica. Specialties: natural philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics. (Intelligence)

#### Speak Latin
This skill is similar to all other Speak (Language) skills, but it is only available to educated characters. Characters who have associated with magi for long periods of time may have picked up Speak Latin with the storyguide's permission. All educated characters know Latin, since without it you cannot learn any Academic Knowledges. In other areas of the world, Greek and Hebrew fill similar functions. Characters with foreign backgrounds may choose either of these instead of Latin. Specialties: academic usage, Church ceremonies, Hermetic usage. (Intelligence)

#### Theology
Theology is the study of God and his work in the world. The auctores are the Bible and Peter the Lombard's Sententiae, the Bible having theoretical primacy, being infallible, and the Sentences being most studied. The speculations of theology are very abstruse, and many theologians are accused of heresy. Sometimes those accused recant, and sometimes they convince the Church that they were right after all. Theology can also be purchased (as a separate skill) for other religions like Islam and Judaism. Specialties: biblical knowledge, heresy, history. (Intelligence)

### Arcane Knowledges
Arcane Knowledges are only available to magi or characters with formal training gained by possession of a Virtue. Arcane Knowledges may also be purchased by characters who seek out training in the course of a saga.

#### Enigmatic Wisdom
A far-reaching perception of strange and baffling phenomena that helps you understand their nature, though you may seem strange or even ludicrous to the uninitiated. This Knowledge is rarely taken by magi of houses other than Criamon, though there is no restriction against it. Your score in this Knowledge is added to rolls to interpret dreams and riddles, and to understand phantasms and arcane or mysterious situations. Thanks to this Ability, Criamon magi go into Wizard's Twilight ([see page 182](../page-refs/page-182.md)) more often, but survive it better than most. Specialties: interpreting signs, explaining the Enigma, Twilight. (Perception, Intelligence)

#### Faerie Lore
Familiarity with faerie powers, weaknesses, motivations, and areas. Specialties: faerie forests, faerie mounds, specific types of faeries. (Intelligence)

#### Hermetic Law
Judging events according to the Code of Hermes and the Peripheral Code. In addition to memorizing important precedents, this knowledge includes the practical side of enforcing Hermetic law—for example, knowing when to push for a vote or how to present an argument. Specialties: Wizards' Marches, apprentices, mundane relations, tribunal procedures, political intrigue. (Intelligence, Presence, Communication)

#### Occult Lore
An understanding and familiarity with the sinister side of the world. Includes knowledge of demons and their habits and weaknesses, undead and their habits and weaknesses, and the power of curses. Specialties: demons, undead, curses. (Intelligence)

#### Magic Theory
Knowledge of what magic is and how it works, used primarily in the laboratory. Magic Theory deals primarily with Hermetic magic, though higher scores might indicate some knowledge of other traditions. You can sometimes gain experience through experimentation ([see page 191](../page-refs/page-191.md)). Specialties: inventing spells, enchanting items, potions. (Intelligence)

### Casual Knowledges
These can be studied, but one can also pick them up through direct experience. They do not require a specific virtue to choose them initially.

#### (Area) Lore
Knowledge of one particular region, covenant, or even a village. It includes knowing where things are in the immediate area, local history and legends, and the centers of power in the region. Specialties: geography, history, politics, personalities. (Intelligence)

#### (Organization) Lore
Knowledge of the structure, operation, and goals of the specified organization. Organizations can be as large as the Church, or as small as a local craft guild. The smaller the organization, the more detailed your knowledge. Specialties: personalities, history, politics. (Intelligence)

#### Legend Lore
Familiarity with legends and folklore, some of which may even be true. Use this Ability when you are trying to remember information about some mythical place, beast, or hero. Legend Lore can often give vital insights into the weaknesses of a monster or the location of a mystic site. Specialties: beasts, heroes, particular places, particular events. (Intelligence)

## Exceptional Ability List
There are many Abilities in Ars Magica that are not available to all characters, and so are not described here in the Abilities section. Most are gained through the purchase of a specific Virtue. Exceptional Abilities may never be used or even attempted by characters who do not have the appropriate Ability. All Exceptional Abilities are listed below, and page references are given so that you can locate their descriptions easily.

#### Speak (Language)
Fluency in a particular language. Rather than a die roll modifier, your score in this Knowledge measures your ability to communicate.

| Score | Fluency  |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | ...Basic ideas  |
| 3     | ...Haltingly functional  |
| 5     | ...Fluent  |
| 7     | ...Perfect clarity and understanding  |

When two people speak to each other, the lower Ability score determines how well they communicate. Characters who speak related languages can communicate at a penalty to their scores (assigned by the storyguide) depending on how closely related the two languages are. Speak Latin (and Greek and Hebrew) cannot be chosen with this Knowledge—it is a separate Academic Knowledge. Specialties: specific dialects, expansive vocabulary, specific technical vocabulary, slang. (Intelligence)
