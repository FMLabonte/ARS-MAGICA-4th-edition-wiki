# Steps in Character Creation

When you create a character in Ars Magica, you will go through a series of steps which are described briefly below and filled out in detail in the coming pages. If you don't understand what to do right now, don't worry—things will be explained in greater depth as you go along. For now, just try to get a general feeling of what you will be doing as you develop your character.

## Step 1: Concept

In this section, you'll build the basic framework for your character. You'll decide what sort of character he will be and what basic function he will fulfill. You will also be determining such defining characteristics as gender, age, and origin.

- Determine character type: magus, companion, grog
- Choose gender, age, and origin
- Magi: select House, record house-specific Virtues and Flaws
- Companions: select vocation (optional)
- Grogs: select vocation (optional)
- Pick a name

## Step 2: Characteristics

In this section, you will determine values for your character's Characteristics, that is, his innate ability in various areas of human endeavor. Characteristics can be determined either through a point-based purchasing system or by random die roll.

- Either purchase or roll and assign your Characteristic values

## Step 3: Virtues and Flaws

Virtues and Flaws are arguably the most important things about your character. They are what make him special and distinct from the masses of Mythic Europe. You will select a number of Virtues and Flaws in such a way that the bonuses granted by your character's Virtues counterbalance the shortcomings described by his Flaws.

- Companions: Choose one Social Class Virtue or Flaw
- Grogs: Choose one Grog Background Virtue or Flaw
- Select Virtues and Flaws

## Step 4: Abilities

Your character's Abilities are those Talents, Skills, and Knowledges learned either from study or experience. The number of Abilities that your character begins the game with is determined by his starting age.

- Select Abilities

## Step 5: Magical Abilities

At this point in character creation, magi select their beginning Art scores and known spells, both learned during apprenticeship. Companions and grogs skip this step.

- Magi: Select Arts and formulaic spells

## Step 6: Finishing Touches

In this section, you will round out your character, adding personality and making sure that everything you have done so far fits together. You will also choose your starting equipment and perform a few bookkeeping tasks.

- Reputations (if applicable)
- Personality Traits
- Further characterization: quirks, history, appearance
- Confidence
- Size
- Health and Fatigue
- Equipment and Encumbrance
- Calculated Combat Values

## Concept

Your character concept should have a broad base, then become more closely defined as you progress through character creation. First decide whether your character is a grog, companion or magus. Then think about his basic identity. Is your grog a stablehand, a cook, or a guard? Is your companion a warrior, or a bookworm? What kind of spells do you see your magus wielding?

Next, you need to decide your character's gender, age, and origin. All three may be chosen freely. Keep in mind that while you can choose any age, the older your character is, the more likely he is to suffer the adverse effects of advancing age. A character who is over 35 at the start of the game may have to make aging rolls before the saga begins. See "Aging" on [page 180](../page-refs/page-180.md). Once age is determined, figure your character's year of birth based on the year the saga begins. That way, even if your character is out of the action for several years of game time, you can figure out his age upon resuming play.

Sometime during the creation process you will need to choose a name for your character. It can be anything you like. You will probably want to choose a name that reflects the character's ethnic background, but nicknames and pseudonyms are just as possible.
