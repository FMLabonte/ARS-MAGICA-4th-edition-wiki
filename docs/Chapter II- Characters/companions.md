# Companions

One of the most important factors to consider when conceptualizing your companion is why he has come to work for the magi and their covenant. Some may do so to gain knowledge, while others have more tangible goals like the acquisition of wealth and power. Many have backgrounds or talents that make them exceptional, but also make them outcasts from mundane society.

The following are descriptions of several vocations that you can use in guiding the creation of your companion. These vocations are much more informal than the magi templates found in the previous section. Each has a set of suggested Abilities that you will want to consider purchasing when you come to the Abilities step of character creation. Feel free to add, change, or delete any Abilities—they are intended simply to help you identify the main skills one would need to be considered a competent professional in a field, and to spark your imagination in creating new character concepts. Likewise, there are no required Virtues or Flaws that are associated with these vocations. Regardless of vocation, all companions (even those not based on a vocation) automatically start with Speak Own Language 5. You aren’t required to choose a vocation, and may create your companion from scratch if you prefer. You will find out how many points you get to purchase scores in your Abilities in that section.

Whether you use a vocation or not, when you select Virtues and Flaws for your Companion, you must account for your companion’s social class by choosing one of the Virtues or Flaws listed under Companion Social Class in the Virtues and Flaws section. Simply having all the skills listed under “knight” does not automatically confer that title, you must also purchase the appropriate Virtue.

### Bandit

You are crafty and slippery by nature. You probably acquire most of your money in town, but hire your services out to the magi when they need a job done. If there’s frequent work to be had at the covenant you may live there, relying on the magi for protection against the law (you have to do some entrepreneurial work, after all). When magi go abroad you often accompany them to acquire information—and the occasional trinket.

### Courtier

You are educated, trained in social skills, and of high enough rank to do as you wish. Courtly life occupies your time, but bores you. Out of curiosity and a desire for adventure, you associate with the covenant. However, you try to keep that association secret, for it could mean social alienation back at court. Note that you must have the Educated Virtue to purchase many of the Abilities listed below.

**Courtier Abilities:** Artes Liberales, Civil & Canon Law, Etiquette, Guile, Intrigue, Noble Lore, Ride, Scribe Latin, Speak Latin.

### Forester

You patrol the forests of a lord or even of the monarch, or maybe you protect lands deeded to a covenant's magi. You are your own keeper, though you must be ever vigilant—if you don't protect the reserved game, you could lose your hand in place of a poacher's. You are of value to the covenant because you know the lands you patrol, and can help magi find things they seek there. In return the covenant offers companionship, for most commoners shy away from you to avoid recognition.

**Forester Abilities:** Animal Handling, Area Lore, Athletics, Awareness, Hunt, Stealth, Survival, one or more Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

### Hermit

You once belonged to society, but ostracized yourself or were exiled, maybe for religious reasons. You've learned much about the world and the supernatural in your lonely life. It seems a shame not to share your insight, but ordinary people just don't understand you. The magi listen to what you have to say and treat you with respect since their lives are also devoted to solitary contemplation. Though you may not live in the covenant, you're not far away.

**Hermit Abilities:** Area Lore, Chirurgy, Legend Lore, Survival.

### Knight

You are a warrior with a vow to serve a noble, and in turn your monarch. Alternatively, you may pay homage to a church, magus, covenant, or the Order of Hermes itself; maybe the covenant has protected you and your people in the past and now you repay the debt. You are able to move through all social circles, both magical and mundane. Magi therefore value you as a mediator between them and worldly powers. Your skills in combat are also essential to the covenant's defense.

**Knight Abilities:** Animal Handling, Athletics, Etiquette, Intrigue, Leadership, Noble Lore, Ride, several Weapon Classes (including Brawl, Shield and Weapon, and Longshaft).

### Mendicant

You are a member of the clergy and have taken a vow of poverty, dedicating your life to the common folk. You work with the magi because you know they are, or can be, good people. Furthermore, you don't see any harm in trying to convert the magi to Christianity, or at least ensure that they don't take the Church for granted. The covenant also offers you an opportunity to see the world, and invites you to do things your vows fail to prohibit.

**Mendicant Abilities:** Chirurgy, Church Lore, Folk Ken, Scribe Greek, Scribe Latin, Scribe Own Language, Speak Greek, Speak Latin, Theology.

### Merchant

You are a seller of wares and may be itinerant, traveling the lands to acquire provisions and necessities for your covenant. Magi often take you on the road with them to deal with mundanes and their petty business tricks. When not abroad you maintain lines of communication with your contacts, customers, and suppliers. If you don't, the magi might terminate your services. Then what would you do for profit?

**Merchant Abilities:** Area Lore, Awareness, Bargain, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, Guile, Ride, Wagoneering.

### Troubadour

You are a minstrel, an actor-musician-comedian. Though you might have wandered the land at one time, you've since settled at the covenant. The people there appreciate your music and pay you well—be it coin, food or ale—for a song. Even the rather aloof magi seem to enjoy the occasional tune. You can also embellish your repertoire at the covenant. There are plenty of legends to learn there, and you can sometimes take part in their making.

**Troubadour Abilities:** Carouse, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, Jongleur, Legend Lore, Play Instrument, Sing, Storytelling, one or more Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

### Turb Captain

You command all the covenant's grogs, and rose from the ranks through your exemplary service. You now spend much of your time in administrative routine, either recording information about your troops or ordering supplies. The magi expect you to assemble a turb for journeys and rely on your expert choice of skilled, dependable grogs. You are at times able to escape the tedium of your position by assigning yourself to traveling parties.

**Turb Captain Abilities:** Area Lore, Athletics, Awareness, Carouse, Leadership, Ride, Scribe Own Language, several Weapon Classes (including Brawl).
