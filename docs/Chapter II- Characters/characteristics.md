# Characteristics

There are eight Characteristics in Ars Magica, each representing one of a given character's inborn attributes. Each Characteristic has a score that describes the degree of the character's aptitude. A score of 0 is completely average, therefore positive numbers denote higher-than-average ability and negative numbers below-average ability. All but the most exceptional of individuals have Characteristics that fall between -3 and +3.

Since Characteristics represent your character's inborn potential, they cannot be increased by normal means. In rare circumstances, the storyguide may decide that drastic events warrant some sort of permanent change to a Characteristic.

Characteristics are often grouped into pairs for convenience. When this is done, Intelligence is grouped with Perception, Strength with Stamina, Presence with Communication, and Dexterity with Quickness.

## Characteristic Descriptions

### Intelligence (Int)
Intelligence represents both memory and the capacity to learn and think. It is important for Abilities that require thought power and is paramount for the Hermetic Arts. A character with low Intelligence is not necessarily stupid—common sense, street savvy, and wisdom are not described by Intelligence.

### Perception (Per)
Perception quantifies the ability to notice things, as well as powers of intuition. While sometimes conscious, Perception often works intuitively—your character simply notices something. The storyguide may also let you roll Perception when checking various Knowledges, to see if you have insight into a certain fact or concept. Perception is important for Abilities such as Awareness, Hunt, and Folk Ken.

### Strength (Str)
Strength measures physical power: lifting, pushing, shoving, heaving and moving. Strength is important when hefting a melee weapon and when using brute, physical force against something or someone. People with high Strength are often bigger than those with low Strength, assuming they have the same Size.

### Stamina (Sta)
Stamina represents the limits of a character's exertion, as well as how much physical punishment he can sustain. It is staying power, both mental and physical, and one of its most important components is simply the will to live. Stamina also measures someone's ability to carry a load for an extended period, ignore fatigue, and withstand wounds.

### Presence (Pre)
Presence describes a character's appearance, demeanor and charisma. It is important for making a good impression, as well as for leading people. Presence also measures how imposing or intimidating a person is. Even if not physically attractive, a person with high Presence might still have a demeanor that commands respect.

### Communication (Com)
Communication represents the aptitude for self-expression. It is important when attempting to influence or communicate with someone, verbally or otherwise. A positive Communication score suggests a character who is comfortable with or confident in his relationships with other people.

### Dexterity (Dex)
Dexterity means being able to move with agility and to manipulate objects accurately and skillfully. It includes hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, and bodily grace. Dexterity also helps determine how well your character swings a sword or throws a knife.

### Quickness (Qik)
Quickness indicates reaction speed and reflexes, and helps determine who acts first when two people are trying to do something with great haste. It also describes how well your character does something in a hurry. Your effective Quickness is usually modified by your Encumbrance. [See page 63](../page-refs/page-63.md) for more information on Encumbrance.

## Generating Characteristics

There are two different methods you can use to generate your character's Characteristics. If your storyguide allows it, you may choose between them. The first method allows you to select your Characteristics using point-based purchase system. This allows you to stick closely to your concept. Alternatively, you may use a random method for generating your Characteristics, rolling dice to determine their values. Many players prefer this element of chance in character creation.

### Option 1: Purchase Method

You may spend up to 7 points on positive scores in Characteristics. The cost of a given score is reflected on the Characteristic Cost Table. You will note that buying negative Characteristics yields negative points. Use these to counterbalance the cost of positive Characteristics if you spend more than the seven allotted points.

If you would like to have a Characteristic that is higher than +3 or lower than -3, you should purchase a Characteristic of +3 or -3 now. When you choose Virtues and Flaws you will have the opportunity to increase or decrease your score to a maximum of +5 (or a minimum of -5) only if you already have a +3 or -3.

### Option 2: Random Generation

Random generation produces characters whose Characteristics tend to average to zero, but have the possibility of attaining characteristics of +4 or -4.

You will need two ten-sided dice of different colors. Designate one as the positive die and the other as the negative die. Roll both. If neither die came up 0, subtract the negative die from the positive die, noting the total. For example, if the positive die were a 2 and the negative die a 5, you would record -3. If either die was a 0 (or if both dice turned up the same number), record a 0.

Once you have generated four scores in this way, assign each score to a pair of Characteristics (Int/Per, Str/Sta, Pre/Com, and Dex/Qik). You may then divide that number in any way you choose between the two Characteristics of the pair, provided that you do not assign one to be positive and the other negative or assign any Characteristic a +4 or -4 unless the total was +7, -7, +8, or -8.

### Specialties

After you have generated a score for each Characteristic, assign a specialty to each. A specialty is simply a word that describes each non-zero Characteristic your character has, giving more definition than a statistic like +2 or -1 can. For example, if you have a +1 Strength, is your character "thick," "bulky," or "forceful?" Does your -3 Dexterity indicate that he is "bumbling," or simply "clumsy?" Characteristic specialties help you visualize your character, and other than that, have no mechanical function in the game.
