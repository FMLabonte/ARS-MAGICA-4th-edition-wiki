## 3. Melee

During the melee phase, hand to hand combat is resolved. The most important thing to realize is that each phase represents more than a single swing versus a single parry. A melee phase represents a combination of swings, parries, steps, dodges, half-turns, and other maneuvers. The actual composition of each attack can be narrated and fleshed out as the troupe desires—with great detail and emphasis on storytelling, or with little detail so that the group can move on to other things.

In order to keep the action flowing comprehensibly, the storyguide should divide large battles into small sub-melees and resolve each one separately in each round. A sub-melee is a subset of a large battle whose outcome for the round is not affected by the actions of characters outside the sub-melee. If you are fighting a bear while the rest of your party is otherwise occupied, you and the bear are one sub-melee.

The comparison of your and the bear's attacks and defenses should be played out by itself, rather than having players involved in other battles rolling their dice before yours are resolved. If a magus in your party is casting a spell to slay the bear, then that magus becomes part of the sub-melee, because the effects of that spell are important to the outcome of your battle this round. Use sub-melees loosely and with common sense—they are a guideline that makes the job of running combat easier, not a rule that should confound you and slow the game.

Each engaged party is required to use the weapon class that he declared in the movement phase, with two exceptions. First, a character may always opt to use Brawling to defend himself against an opponent that he declared the intent to engage, no matter what range the two of them wound up at. Second, if a character finds himself at Touch range after having declared the intent to engage at a greater range, he may use Brawling to attack instead of whatever class he declared, provided that he has either a free hand or some brawl-capable weapon in hand (like a dagger, rock, or sword pommel).

When two combatants are engaged, each combatant rolls a stress die, adding the result to his Attack score. This total is known as the Attack Total. The same stress die result should also be added to the Defense score to give the Defense Total. Any modifiers that a given combatant may be entitled to due to a first strike bonus (see "Movement," above) or advantage bonus (see below) should be added to the appropriate Attack Total or Defense Total as the combatant wishes, and any modifiers from the following table that apply should also be added to the appropriate total.

### Melee Modifiers Table

|  Situation | Modifier to Attack and Defense Totals  |
| --- | --- |
|  Engaged at one range inside a weapon's listed range | -6  |
|  Engaged at two ranges inside a weapon's listed range | -12  |
|  Using a single weapon held in off-hand* | -3  |
|  High ground (including mounted vs. unmounted) | +3  |
|  Attacking from surprise** | No Defense***  |
|  Charging*** | +3  |
|  Set for Charge*** | +3  |

*Or attacking with Weapon and Shield held backwards.

**Attacking from surprise means that the defender was engaged without his knowledge.

***The defender is not allowed to add his Defense score to his die roll.

***See definitions of charging under "Movement," above.

***A character with a suitable longshaft weapon may, if he has a higher Initiative Total than an opponent who is charging him, set his weapon against the charge and gain this bonus.

If a combatant's Attack Total is higher than his opponent's Defense Total, determine the difference. This is the result of this round's exchange of swings, dodges, and maneuvers. That difference may be either applied to a hit this round or to an advantage bonus, saving that difference as a bonus to next round's Attack or Defense Total. The difference may not be split between a hit and advantage.

If the difference is applied to a hit, it is added to the attacker's Damage score and becomes the Damage Total. A character that was hit loses one Body level for each five full points by which his opponent's Damage Total exceeds his Soak score. For information on how Body levels work, see "Wounds" on [page 177](../page-refs/page-177.md). Wounds are applied simultaneously to both combatants, unless both will be slain or knocked unconscious by the exchange. In that case, the character with the highest Initiative score deals damage first.

### Optional Rules for Melee

In order to customize melee to the tastes of your troupe, the following optional rules can be used.

**No Carry-over**: In order to simplify and speed combat, you can eliminate the option of saving the difference in Attack Total and Defense Total as an advantage bonus. Instead, all damage must be done immediately.

**Separate Roll for Defense**: Instead of having each player roll once, and then adding both his Attack score for an Attack Total and his Defense score for his Defense Total, you can use a separate roll for each. Using this method, the character with the highest Initiative Total rolls and generates an Attack Total first, which he compares to his opponent's rolled Defense Total. Damage is resolved as normal. Next, the character with the lower Initiative Total rolls a new die and generates an Attack Total, and his opponent rolls a new die and generates a Defense Total. Damage is again resolved as normal.

**Absolute Weapon Ranges**: As the rules stand, characters receive a very large penalty for attacking and defending at ranges shorter than the listed ranges for their weapons. Since this penalty is, in many cases, overwhelming, you can simply forbid characters from attacking or defending when not at the optimum range for their weapon. (But note that characters can always use a brawling defense.)
