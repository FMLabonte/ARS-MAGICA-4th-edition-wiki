## All Out Attack or Defense

There may be times when you want to throw caution to the winds and press the attack at the expense of defending yourself. Conversely, you may not care about damaging your opponent, but only care to keep your skin intact. In either of these cases, you may use an all out attack or an all out defense.

When engaging in an all out attack, you may add a +6 to your Attack Total against a single opponent. To balance this, you may not add your Defense score to a Defense Total against any opponent during the round.

With an all out defense, you may add +6 to your Defense Total against a single opponent. You may not cause damage to any opponent during the round.
