## Introduction to Combat Ranges

Range is the distance between two combatants (or between any two characters or objects). The ranges used in combat correspond to like-named ranges used in spell descriptions, which are discussed as they apply to spells on [page 103](../page-refs/page-103.md). Range is very important in combat, because the range between two combatants determines what sorts of weapons each can use. Longshafted weapons become unwieldy at brawling range, and using a mace against an archer at fifty paces is futile.

### Touch
Combatants in Touch range are either in actual physical contact or within reach of a swung fist. In general, the maximum extent of this range is one pace.

### Reach
Combatants in Reach range are out of reach of an arm, but within two swords' length. Reach includes the distance between one and two paces, varying somewhat depending on the space required for each combatant to swing his weapons.

### Close
Close combatants are outside of sword's reach of each other, but are within a spear's length. This range, which is the maximum for hand to hand combat, starts at two paces distance between combatants and extends up to four paces. Note that Close range does not correspond directly to any spell range.

### Near
Near Combatants are outside of Close range, but are within 15 paces of each other.

### Middle
Combatants in Middle range of each other are outside Near range, but are within 50 paces of one another. Note that Middle range does not correspond directly to any spell range.

### Far
Far range includes the distance outside Middle range up to about 200 paces.
