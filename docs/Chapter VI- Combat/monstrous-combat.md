## Monstrous Combat

Beasts often have special attacks developed individually by the storyguide. Unorthodox attacks often affect the way the combat rolls work. Imagine a fire drake that pounces on its opponents. A Brawling defense could get you out of its way, but a Shield and Weapon defense might just put the shield between you and it. In this case, you would still be knocked to the ground, pinned and perhaps crushed. On the other hand, the shield might at least protect you from some of the creature's claws. Because of their special attacks, beasts and monsters are often exceedingly dangerous in combat. Storyguides should use their imagination and the rules presented here as guidelines to determine how monsters with special attacks fit into the combat system. You can also refer to the Bestiary chapter for ideas.
