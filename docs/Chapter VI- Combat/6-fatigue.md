## 6. Fatigue

After each round of combat, any combatant who engaged an enemy in hand to hand combat during the round must roll a stress die and add it to his Combat Fatigue score. Wound penalties apply to this roll. If the total does not beat an ease factor of 6, the character loses a fatigue level. The storyguide may modify the ease factor for this roll depending on the kind of activity the character performed during the round, or may require rolls of characters who did not participate in any combat but performed other strenuous activities.

If there are any bookkeeping tasks that are required between combat rounds, they should be resolved at the end of the Fatigue phase.

### Combat Considerations

#### Multiple Engagements

It is possible to engage multiple opponents. All Initiative Totals are worked out as normal, and engagements are resolved between each pair of characters as normal. The storyguide, however, should be especially aware and not allows any absurd or impossible situations. A character with a sword cannot possibly engage two characters at opposite ends of a field, for example.

When a single combatant is facing multiple opponents, he receives a cumulative -3 penalty to his Attack and Defense Totals for each combatant over one that he is engaged with. In each case, the combatant uses the same die roll to calculate all Attack and Defense Totals for the round.

For example, Sir Boris, a speedy knight who has rolled an Initiative Total of 20, finds himself arrayed against three bandits who have generated Initiative Totals of 23 (a lucky roll), 15, and 11. The bandits are armed with a sword, sword, and dagger respectively. Sir Boris would like to engage all three, keeping all of them at Reach. The first two bandits would like to engage at Reach as well, so no engagement contest is required. The third would like to move to Touch to use his dagger, but his engagement contest fails (as he compares his 11 to Sir Boris' 20).

Sir Boris' Attack Total against each is diminished by 6 (-3 for each beyond the first). Assuming that his Attack score is 10 and his roll is a 7, he generates an Attack Total of 11 (10 + 7 - 6) against each of his opponents. Sir Boris' Defense Total is likewise diminished by 6 against each opponent.

If the bandit with the dagger had succeeded in closing to Touch range, Sir Boris would have attacked the two with swords with an 11, as above, but would have only had a 5 to hit the dagger-bearing opponent, since he has a further -6 when using his sword at one range inside its optimum range. His defense totals against the bandits with swords are the same as they are above, but again, against the Touch range opponent, he would suffer a further -6. (Of course, at Sir Boris' option, he could use his Brawling skill to defend against the Touch range opponent.)
