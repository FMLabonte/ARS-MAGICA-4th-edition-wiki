## Introduction to Combat Scores

There are seven calculated scores that are often used in combat. It will speed up combat greatly if each character's scores are calculated before combat begins. In cases where a given character is likely to use more than one weapon, a score for each one is needed. These scores are based on Characteristics and Abilities, which you should know for each character, and other modifiers, which can be found on various tables and charts at the end of this chapter.

### Initiative
Initiative reflects your character's ability to maneuver quickly and tactically on the battlefield.

$$
\text{INIT} = \text{QIK} + \text{WEAPON SKILL} + \text{WEAPON INITIATIVE BONUS} + \text{ENC}
$$

### Attack
The Attack score represents your character's ability to connect with his weapon. Melee weapons use Dexterity to calculate this score while missile weapons rely on Perception.

$$
\text{ATK} = (\text{DEX OR PER}) + \text{WEAPON SKILL} + \text{WEAPON ATTACK BONUS} + \text{ENC}
$$

### Defense
The Defense score represents your character's ability to execute a set of defensive postures and blocks in order to avoid incoming attacks. You cannot have a Defense score with a missile weapon. Characters holding missile weapons who must defend use their Brawling skill to determine their Defense score.

$$
\text{DFN} = \text{QIK} + \text{WEAPONS SKILL} + \text{WEAPON DEFENSE BONUS} - \text{SIZE} + \text{ENC}
$$

### Damage
This score indicates how much harm you inflict when your weapon connects. Your character's Strength and Size are only added in melee combat.

$$
\text{DAM} = (\text{STR} + \text{SIZE}) \text{ OR } (\text{NOTHING}) + \text{WEAPON DAMAGE BONUS}
$$

### Soak
This score reflects the amount of physical punishment your character can take before being genuinely hurt.

$$
\text{SOAK} = \text{STM} + \text{SIZE} + \text{ARMOR PROTECTION}
$$

### Combat Fatigue
When your character exerts himself in combat or any other strenuous activity, there is the risk of exhaustion. Practice and training in an activity improve chances to perform that task longer, while less freedom of movement and heavy equipment lower them.

$$
\mathbf{F_{AT}} = \mathbf{STM} + \mathbf{WEAPON\ SKILL} + \mathbf{ENC}
$$

### Encumbrance
Your encumbrance is a measure of how much the equipment you carry hinders your movement. Encumbrance cannot be greater than zero. Note that Loads are negative numbers. See "Encumbrance" on [page 63](../page-refs/page-63.md) in the Character Creation chapter for more information.

$$
\mathrm{ENC} = \mathrm{STR} + \mathrm{LOAD}
$$
