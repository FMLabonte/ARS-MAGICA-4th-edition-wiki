## Unarmed Combat

Making an unarmed attack requires that you be in Touch range with your foe. Often, this means that you will be inside the range of your opponent's Reach weapons, and he will be forced to either accept a large penalty or brawl himself. This makes darting into Touch range a decent defense against a slow opponent who is armed with a longer range weapon.

Before rolling to hit when brawling unarmed, you must determine what sort of brawling maneuver you are attempting. Each option is outlined on the Brawling Maneuvers Table. You may only select one maneuver per opponent each round. After a maneuver is chosen, generate Attack and Defense Totals as described under "Melee," above.

When generating a Damage Total, instead of using your opponent's regular Soak, use the value listed for the type of maneuver you are using. Once a number of Wound levels has been determined, replace each Wound level with the equivalent result described under the type of maneuver.

### Example of Unarmed Combat

Victor the Hulking Brute and Speedy Tomas have engaged one another at Touch range. Victor will attempt to squash poor Tomas (selecting the attack option), while Tomas will use his agility to topple Victor (throwing him). Victor gets a Damage score of 9. Tomas must resist using his regular Soak score, which is 1 (he has no armor and a Stm of +1). He therefore takes a Damage Total of 8, which would normally do one Wound level, but that is converted to one Fatigue level of damage, as per the damage replacement effect. Tomas manages to generate a Damage score of 8. Victor must resist the throw using his Dex + Size instead of his Soak, a total of −2 (his Size is +1, but his Dexterity is −3). Therefore, Victor does 2 Body levels of damage (8 − [−2] = 10, divided by 5 = 2), enough for the throw to be successful. Although Tomas has taken a hit, Victor now lies on the ground.
