## Combat Sequence

Time in combat is measured in rounds. A combat round is about enough time for each character to perform one quick action—an attempt to dash to another part of the battle, swing a sword through a practiced series of related swings, or incant a magic formula—enough time to do something interesting. The amount of time that passes during a round varies between 5 and 20 seconds depending on the activities being performed.

There are six phases to each combat round, each of which resolves in turn a different sort of action. These phases (in order, as they occur each round) are Movement, First Missile, Melee, Second Missile, Magic, and Fatigue. Each phase is described in great detail below, but you can use them very casually when excruciating detail is not required.

### 1. Movement

At this stage, the storyguide asks each player to declare what actions his character(s) will attempt to perform for the duration of the round. When asked, each combatant declares both his intended action and any movement involved. Any character who intends to fight during the round must declare which opponent(s) he is attempting to engage, at what range he intends to engage them, and what weapon(s) he intends to use. Engagement with certain opponents may be impossible due to range or intervening barriers. The storyguide should use common sense in advising players when they declare an impossible or absurd engagement.

After declarations are all made, each combatant rolls a stress die + Initiative score, using the Initiative score appropriate to the weapon he declared. Other modifiers, found on the Initiative Modifiers Table, can modify this total. The result is an Initiative Total. Storyguides should feel free to impose additional modifiers as seem appropriate to a specific situation.

If everything that's been declared is compatible, each action occurs. If some declarations are exclusive (for example, two characters want to occupy the same position, or one character is attempting to engage an unwilling opponent) resolve each character's movement in order from highest to lowest Initiative Total. Higher totals prevail over lower totals.

The most common form of movement in combat is hustling: moving as speedily as possible while keeping your feet and avoiding stray flailings. You can move up to 15 +

#### Initiative Modifiers Table

|  Action | Modifier to Initiative Total  |
| --- | --- |
|  Character on horseback | + Ride skill and high ground  |
|  Character routing | +6*  |
|  Character charging | +3**  |
|  Character holding high ground | +3  |

* A character who declares that he is routing (that is, running away from combat at full speed) cannot make an attack and may not defend against any incoming attacks for the duration of the round.

** A character who is charging must have sufficient room for a running start, adjudicated by the storyguide. This modifier can also applied to mounted characters who are charging, in addition to the modifier they get from simply being on horseback.

Quickness paces per round while hustling; less on broken ground or in the dark. Walking cautiously moves you 9 + Quickness + Encumbrance paces per round. An all-out sprint covers a total number of paces equal to 30 + Quickness + Athletics + Enc, including Wound and Fatigue penalties. The storyguide may require sprinting characters to make an Athletics roll to avoid falling or injuring themselves, especially when sprinting on uneven terrain.

Characters who are simply moving—not engaging other characters or being engaged by them—are free to travel up to the maximum range of the declared mode of movement, as long as they don't travel inside the Effective Space (as defined by weapon) of a character who is engaged in combat. Characters who intend to move and then engage in

#### Movement Table

|  Speed | Paces per Round  |
| --- | --- |
|  Walking | 9+ Qik  |
|  Hustling | 15 + Qik + Enc  |
|  Sprinting | 30 + Qik + Athletics + Enc – Wound – Fatigue  |
|  Horseback (safe gallop) | 50 + Ride  |

### Engagement Example

Alberto and Bors have been fighting two thieves, Frederico and Inigo, and with Frederico injured, are pressing their advantage. Alberto declares he will move to engage Frederico in Reach with his sword, using the class single weapon (Frederico managed to disengage from Alberto last Round). Bors declares he will move to engage Inigo at Close range with his spear, using the longshaft class. The storyguide declares that Frederico will be routing, attempting to run 30 yards into cover without engaging or being engaged by any one. He declares Inigo will move to engage Bors at Touch range with his dagger, brawling with him.

Bors rolls the highest Initiative Total of 18, followed by Inigo at 13, Frederico at 11, and Alberto at 10. Since Bors and Inigo wish to be engaged at different ranges, they have an engagement contest. Bors has the higher Initiative Total, and so they wind up engage at Close range, giving Bors a +5 (18–13) first strike bonus. Inigo cannot attack Bors (because Bors is outside the range of his dagger). Frederico manages to get away without Alberto engaging him (since his Initiative Total was higher), and Alberto is left with nothing to do but chase Frederico, or perhaps engage Inigo next round.

### 2. First Missiles

There are two missile phases per round, one before Melee and one after Melee. This simulates the fact that each missile weapon fires at a different rate depending on the nature of the weapon and the user's speed and proficiency.

#### Missile Fire Table

|  Target Condition | Ease Factor Adjustment  |
| --- | --- |
|  Target in Touch or Reach Range | No firing possible  |
|  Target in Close or Near Range | +3  |
|  Target in Middle Range | 0  |
|  Target in Far Range | +6  |
|  Target is Obscured (darkness or cover) | +3  |
|  Target is unmoving or walking carefully | 0  |
|  Target is hustling | +3  |
|  Target is sprinting | +6  |
|  Target is size 0 | 0  |
|  Target is small | + (absolute value of Size)  |
|  Target is large | - Size  |
|  Target is dodging or defending | Defender's Defense*  |
|  Shooter aims | -3**  |
|  Target has a shield | + Dfn value of shield***  |

*If you are firing at an opponent who has spotted you and defensively engaged you in the movement phase, your ease factor is modified by his Defense score (as reflected on the table), but he must count you as an opponent that he has engaged.

**Spending a whole missile phase taking no action but aiming gives this bonus, provided that the shooter does not move or otherwise act before actually firing.

***That is, the value that shield is assigned in the Weapon Table, not the Defense score of the character who carries the shield. If a character with a shield is actively defending against you, then yes, the shield does count twice.

Some speedy shooters will be able to loose missiles twice per round—once per missile phase. Others, because of slow weapons or sluggish wits, will be able to fire less often.

Which missile phase(s) you fire in depends on your Initiative score, and is reflected in the Missile Rate Table. This table assumes that the archer is spending all of his time between each actual shot reloading and prepping his weapon. If an archer does not do this, any round that he does not prep does not count. For example, if a character who is using a weapon with a –12 Initiative score fires one round and runs to a new position the next round, he cannot fire again in the third round because he can only fire every other round when he has spent the intervening round engaged in loading and upkeep.

If the order that projectiles are loosed makes a difference in a situation, the character with the highest Initiative Total fires first, followed by the next highest, down to the lowest. Thus, it is possible for one quick archer to slay another before the second has time to shoot back.

#### Missile Rate Table

|  Initiative | First Missile? | Second Missile?  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  -20 or less | Every third round | Never  |
|  -19 to -10 | Every other round | Never  |
|  -9 to 0 | Every round | Never  |
|  +1 to +10 | Every round | Every other round  |
|  +11 or more | Every round | Every round  |

#### Optional Longbow and Crossbow Damage Rule
Longbows and, to a lesser extent, crossbows, are very dangerous weapons in Mythic Europe. While there are accounts of arrows fired from short bows accumulating by the dozens, stuck in the armor of mounted knights, longbows and crossbows could often penetrate that armor and kill in a single shot. At the storyguide's option, projectiles fired from longbows and crossbows can do one Wound level of damage for every two points that the Damage Total exceeds the target's Soak, rather than for every five points.

#### Optional Called Shots Rule
Archers can be allowed to make called shots, aiming for special targets either in hopes of causing extra damage or having some other special effect. The storyguide should assign a modifier based on the Size of the targeted area (which is cumulative with other modifiers). If the roll is missed, the shot fails. If it succeeds, the result depends on the target. If the intent was to do extra damage by striking an exposed area, damage is figured according to the Optional Longbow and Crossbow Damage Rule, above (even if the weapon being fired was not a Longbow or Crossbow). If the archer intended to have some other effect, the storyguide should use common sense to adjudicate.
