## 5. Magic

During the Magic phase, all spontaneous spells are cast and resolved, and then all formulaic spells are cast and resolved. If a magus wishes to interrupt an action in any phase before the Magic phase with a spell, he must fast-cast. Rules for fast-casting, for spontaneous spells, and for formulaic spells are found in the Magic chapter.

In situations where it is important to know which magi is able to cast a spell first (and both are formulaic or both are spontaneous), compare Qik + Finesse + Encumbrance. The caster with the higher score gets his spell off first.
