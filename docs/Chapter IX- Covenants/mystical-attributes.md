# Mystical Attributes

## Supernatural Aura
An average covenant has a magical aura of 3. Increasing or decreasing the aura costs a number of pyramid points that corresponds to the increase or decrease. (For example, 6 positive points gets you +6, six negative points gets you 0.) If you put more than six negative points into this attribute, your covenant is within the Dominion.

**Example:** Voluntas is a relatively recent foundation, so a very high aura doesn't make much sense. Still, David decides to spend the three points necessary to get a +5.

## Magical Items
Each positive point buys 75 levels of beneficial magical items. Each negative point pays for a similar level of baneful items (but it must be harder to get rid of these than picking them up and carting them out). The troupe should generate the magical items by reference to the Laboratory chapter, if they are Hermetic, or by assessing the equivalent level if they are not.

**Example:** David decides that Voluntas does not have any magical items, despite the resident Verditius. Being a necromancer, he does not bother to share his discoveries.

## Laboratories
The covenant's laboratories may be better or worse than the Hermetic average. To have two laboratories with a bonus costs a number of positive pyramid points corresponding to the bonus you are purchasing. The opposite is true for shoddy labs. Thus, two laboratories with a +3 bonus would cost 6 positive points, while four laboratories with a -1 penalty would cost 2 negative points. To have two laboratories at +3 and four at -1 would cost 6 positive and 2 negative points, not 4 positive points (because it is important to keep track of running totals for both negative and positive points). Laboratories with a bonus have been improved by the work of past magi of the covenant, while those with a penalty contain old or inadequate equipment. At the troupe's option, this may also reflect local aura fluctuations or the presence of some magical effect which interferes with lab work (but a penalty should not be explained by a locally lower aura unless there is a really good reason why the magus cannot simply move the lab).

**Example:** David now has three positive points left to spend, and he decides to make all the laboratories +1. He decides that the improvement work was largely done by Kirist—the Flambeau might have a nasty temper, but he is still capable of being cooperative.

Overall, he has spent six positive points in this area, giving Voluntas a Mystical Attributes score of +3.
