# Covenant Characteristics

Covenants are quantified by eight characteristics that describe different aspects of the covenant. Characteristics, in turn, are each described by three sub-characteristics, called traits, that define the separate areas governed by each characteristic. While characteristic scores provide a broad look at a large area of a covenant's character, traits are the actual scores that describe specific aspects of a covenant. Characteristics and traits have values that are assigned based on the positive or negative aspect of the area that the trait describes.

For example, one of the covenant characteristics is called Buildings. It describes (predictably) the physical buildings that make up the covenant. The three traits that make up the characteristic Buildings are Size, Quality, and Repair. Each of the four statistics has a value, which can be positive or negative. The values of traits add up to determine the value of a characteristic.

Continuing the example, imagine that the covenant has a large number of decent buildings that are in bad repair.

|  Characteristic Score | Sum of Traits  |
| --- | --- |
|  +5 | 15  |
|  +4 | 10  |
|  +3 | 6  |
|  +2 | 3  |
|  +1 | 1  |
|  0 | 0  |
|  -1 | -1  |
|  -2 | -3  |
|  -3 | -6  |
|  -4 | -10  |
|  -5 | -15  |

Note that characteristics are not bounded at $+/-5$. Continue the progression as far as needed.

The Size trait might be +4, the Quality +1, and the Repair -2. The sum of these traits is 3. This sum is used to determine the score of the Buildings characteristic (but is not itself the score). This score is purchased using a pyramidal scale the same way that characters' Ability and Art scores are. Looking at the chart provided, a sum of 3 equates to a score of +2. Note that the sum of traits does not always add up the exact number needed to purchase a given characteristic value. Such values should be rounded towards zero when the characteristic value is determined. Thus, if 7 points worth of traits were totaled to determine a characteristic, that characteristic's value would be +3.

This pyramidal purchase scale is used at several other points in covenant creation. When it is mentioned, you can use the chart above to determine the costs of various traits.

|  Season | Plus | Minus  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Spring | +20 | -50  |
|  Summer | +40 | -30  |
|  Autumn | +80 | -20  |
|  Winter | +40 | -50  |

## Beginning Steps

The first thing you will have to decide is what season your covenant is in when you create it. Once this has been decided, refer to the table above for the number of positive and negative points that you must spend when purchasing the covenant's traits. These values are approximations—not every summer covenant will add up to the totals listed. But since the change between seasons takes place over time, this is as it should be. We recommend that you stick to the values listed when creating your troupe's covenant.

You should give some thought to the background of the covenant before you start spending points. You will create a much more realistic and cohesive place if you have some overarching ideas at this stage.

Example: David decides to work out the details of Voluntas, having written the story of one of its apprentices. He already has a fairly detailed con

## Covenant Characteristics

### Site

#### Access

Access governs how easily your covenant can get things that it needs, whether food or more esoteric supplies. It does not deal with how easily other people can get at the covenant—that is covered by Seclusion, below. If your covenant has good access and also good seclusion you will

There are two aspects to Access: how good your supplies are, and how easily you can get at them. An average covenant has access to supplies similar to those available to the average peasant, and draws them from a radius of one day's journey (about 20 miles). This trait is not concerned with the quantity of supplies. That is paid for as a part of Inhabitants, below.

The quality of supplies is bought by spending points, either positive or negative. The table on the previous page summarizes what a given number of points will purchase.

|  Cost | Quality of Supplies  |
| --- | --- |
|  -3 | No supplies—the covenant must steal them.  |
|  -1 | Low quality supplies that tend to dry up in bad years.  |
|  0 | Supplies equal to those available to average peasants.  |
|  +1 | Supplies equal to those available to prosperous peasants.  |
|  +3 | Supplies similar to those available minor clergy.  |
|  +6 | Supplies similar to those available to a wealthy merchant.  |
|  +15 | Supplies similar to those available to a landed noble.  |

At the higher levels, the quality does not imply that all the covenfolk live like lords. It does mean that they have a wide variety of food and other goods. For example, there may be glass and silverware around, and they will eat meat as well as vegetables. Supplies will not fail above +1, even in years of drought and famine, unless they are deliberately interrupted.

The distances involved in procuring supplies are rated on a five step scale. An average covenant draws 20% of its supplies from within the covenant, 40% from within seven miles, and 40% from within a day's journey. Spending one positive point will move 20% of the supplies one step closer, while a negative point will move them one step further away. The closest 20% is assumed to include the covenant's water supply, the furthest such exotica as lab equipment.

Note that the actual location of the covenant need have little bearing on the distances. A covenant on a mountaintop could, with a regio, have excellent supplies available within the walls, while a covenant in a city might have to buy supplies in from a great distance (though that would require a good explanation). Normally a mountaintop location will push some supplies out to two days' distance, especially if you want quality. Locating in a city brings everything within half a day's travel, and thus cost 2 positive points.

|  Distance (one way) | Average Percentage at that Distance  |
| --- | --- |
|  Within the covenant | 20%  |
|  Within half a day's journey | 40%  |
|  Within a day's journey | 40%  |
|  Within two days' journey | 0%  |
|  Within a week's journey | 0%  |

**Example:** Voluntas's supplies are of average quality, which costs no points. However, it is in the middle of the North York Moors. David decides that the well is within the covenant, and so the normal 20% comes from inside. In addition, the village of Wilton can supply a substantial amount, and that is within seven miles, a half day's travel. The rest of the supplies, however, are much further away: at least a week's journey. David moves the 40% of his supplies usually found within day's journey away by two steps, generating a total of 4 negative points.

#### Seclusion

An average covenant has to deal with a curious traveler once a week. Each positive point doubles the time interval, each negative one halves it. This can be consistent with any level of access. An obvious castle on a mountain might have poor access and good seclusion, while an invisible castle by a main road might have good scores in both.

Travelers will generally be looking for shelter, and will have legitimate reasons for their journeys, often trading or pilgrimage. If there is nothing obviously magical about the covenant, they will probably not cause trouble. A covenant with poor seclusion would therefore be well served by making an effort to appear normal. Seclusion also covers the difficulty that mundane authorities have in finding you if they want to make trouble.

**Example:** Voluntas's location comes in useful for seclusion. No one would have much reason for traveling the Moors, other than being lost or looking for the covenant. David decides that getting lost is relatively common in the Middle Ages, and so someone turns up every couple of months, or eight weeks. That costs 3 positive points.

#### Environment

An average environment provides no benefit or penalty. Better than average environments might have especially good air, while below average ones are unhealthy areas like swamps. Environment can be purchased by buying bonuses and penalties to aging rolls at double the pyramid cost of the bonus or penalty (so for example, buying a +3 bonus costs 12 points).

Environment is also the catch-all category for unusual features of the site, such as a magical spring with water that makes people drunk or magical flowers that bloom all winter. The storyguide should assign costs as he feels appropriate.

**Example:** The Moors are a bit boggy in places, but probably not enough to make the environment unhealthy. There were no magical features in the initial concept, so he leaves it at that, spending no points on Environment.

Voluntas thus has four negative and three positive points in site, for a total of one negative point, and a score of -1.

### Buildings

#### Size

An average covenant has enough living space for 6 magi, 20 specialists, and 50 grogs. This is about the same size as a medium-sized monastery or a very large manor. Each negative point removes space for 2 magi, 20 specialists, or 50 grogs. Each positive point adds the same amount.

Covenants can also have impressive structures: great halls, council chambers, impressive libraries, and the like. Each impressive structure costs 1 point. An average covenant gets one for free, which may be removed by spending one negative point. If there is no impressive structure, there are still mundane rooms for necessary functions. Impressive structures may be part of the main structure, such as a great hall built into a manor, or separate, such a freestanding church or chapel. Many medieval buildings are constructed around a courtyard, with the various ranges (sides of the court) dedicated to specific functions, such as servants' quarters or storage.

**Example:** Voluntas was described as a large manor, so average size seems about right. There are only five magi resident, but David decides that there is space for another. He hesitates over the impressive structure, since Julia has not built her council chamber, but decides that the library qualifies. Thus, no points are spent here.

#### Quality

One positive point will make two points of space good quality, or one point excellent quality. (One point of space is that for 2 magi, 20 specialists, 50 grogs, or 1 impressive structure.) Quality includes artistic quality, good design for living (not just looking at), and durability of materials. Good quality might mean tiled roofs, glazed windows, and stone walls. Excellent quality might include carved buttresses, stained glass, internal bathrooms, or even plumbing and hypocaust heating.

One negative point will make two points of space poor quality, or one point dreadful quality. Poor quality might mean poorly designed roofs which catch water and rot the thatch, wattle and daub rather than wood and plaster for walls, or even poorly executed attempts at decoration. Dreadful quality means that the roof lets in rain no matter how well repaired it is, the wind can get through the walls, and the windows are unglazed and cannot even be shuttered.

**Example:** Although the quality of Voluntas is not covered in the initial concept, David decides that Julia will not have put up with shoddy work, so it is all at least average. Further, he feels that she would have pushed for some better areas, and decides that the library, Julia's quarters, and the quarters of one other magus are of good quality. That costs 1 positive point.

### Repair
Repair determines how well kept up your buildings are. Good repair means that there are no major problems, and minor ones are fixed within a day or so. Excellent repair means that everything is as good as new (unless the basic quality is poor, in which case there will still be problems). Poor repair means that even quality roofs leak, that the plumbing does not work, or that the hypocaust belches smoke into the living areas. If a building in poor repair is also of poor quality, sections of walls are patched with sacking and propped up with beams of wood, and areas of floor are almost rotted through.

One positive point can put two points of size in good repair, or one in excellent. Negative points mean the things are falling down. Each negative point indicates that about 10 pounds of silver must be spent on repairs each year, or one point of Size will be lost. (Note that you lose 1 size point no matter how many negative you take here—it just costs more to avoid the loss).

> Example: The members of Voluntas do not seem the sort to be obsessed with repair, and Julia is more likely to go on to new projects than look after old ones, so David decides to spend no points here, taking average repair.

> Thus, overall one positive point has been spent on buildings, giving a score of +1.

## Defenses

### Site
The covenant's site affects its defensibility to a great extent. Positive points here buy easily defended sites like the top of a hill, an island in a river, or a peninsula. As a rough rule of thumb, consider there to be four ways of approaching a covenant. 1 point will make one approach a bit difficult (heavy brush, soft ground, or a gentle upward slope), 2 will make it difficult (a rock field, marsh, or moderate slope), 3 will make it very hard (a steep slope or river), and 4 will make it all but impossible (a cliff or chasm).

Negative points buy defensive weaknesses. Again, consider four directions. 1 point puts cover in one direction (a forest), 2 makes it overlook the covenant (a cliff), and 3 makes it dangerous (a waterfall which could be diverted into the covenant). A covenant on a mountain which can only be approached along one track would spend 15 points here: 4 points for three sides, and 3 points for the side with the track. A covenant at the base of a mountain, with a river running past it on one side, would pay 3 positive points for the side with the river, and 2 negative points for the overlooking mountain behind it.

> Example: Voluntas is built on the moors, which are mostly flat heathland. David could justify spending one point on each direction of approach to represent difficult, soft, ground, but decides not to, at this stage.

### Extent
The living quarters previously purchased include basic defenses—either stone walls and thick doors on every building, or a basic wall around them. One negative point will leave one point of space completely undefended. One positive point will make one point of space well defended (arrow slits and battlements, or an elaborate wall). Concentric walls are very expensive: they cost a number of points equal to the size within, plus the cost of any elaborate defensive structures built on them.

One positive point buys an elaborate defensive structure (like a gatehouse or watch tower). A basic covenant gets one for free, which may be bought off with a negative point. Elaborate defensive structures may be built into other defenses, like a gatehouse, or be separate, like a watchtower or gate blocking a river. A stone wall is a basic defense. If the wall has battlements and a parapet for the guards, then the defense is elaborate.

> Example: Voluntas has a stone wall, but there is no description of the defenses of the rest of the covenant, other than mention of two towers. David decides that these both count as elaborate defensive structures and spends a positive point to account for the second one. He decides that the rest of the buildings have basic defenses, and so spends no more points.

### Repair
Repair for defensive structures is the same as repair for buildings. Note that defenses in poor repair may be easy to breach, since the wall may be weakened, or the portcullises non-functional.

> Example: Average repair seems most appropriate, and so David spends no points here.

> Overall, then, Voluntas has Defenses +1.
