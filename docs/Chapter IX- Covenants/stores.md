# Stores

## Vis Stocks
An average covenant has 100 pawns of vis in stock. Every positive point increases this by 50. Every negative point decreases it by 50. Negative amounts of vis indicate a vis debt. In general, the covenant has 25 years to pay this off—the troupe should work out the details. Vis stocks are separate from vis supplies, and may be of any Art or combination of Arts.

**Example:** David decides that he needs to get rid of some negative points, and this is as good a place as any to do it. He decides that Voluntas has no vis on hand, for two negative points.

## Supplies
An average covenant has no mundane supplies stored up (like cash or other unused things) beyond the annual stock of food. 1 point buys 500 pounds of silver worth, while 1 negative point buys a similar amount of debt. This is separate from income.

500 pounds of silver is a lot of money, equivalent to about 600 cubic meters of wheat. That's enough to feed a peasant family for 200 years, or about 5000 sheep, or 1500 oxen. Alternatively, it would buy about 500 average books, 20 normal, timber-framed houses, or a parish church with a tower.

**Example:** It seems unreasonable that Voluntas would have large stocks of mundane things. On the contrary, Julia's projects are likely to eat up funds beyond those immediately available, and so a debt makes sense. The lack of any really spectacular structures suggests that these debts are likely to be modest, so he only spends one negative point here, for a total debt of 500 pounds of silver.

## Reputation
An average covenant has no net reputation. Good reputations are bought with positive points, bad reputations with negatives. Buying a reputation costs a number of pyramid points equal to the level of the reputation. Thus, a level 3 good reputation would cost 6 positive points, while a level 4 bad reputation would cost 10 negative. Reputations for covenants work the same way that the do for characters ([see page 191](../page-refs/page-191.md)). The storyguide may wish to modify the costs slightly depending on the power and influence of the affected party.

**Example:** None of Voluntas's magi seem the sort to get along well with others. Julia is too pushy, and Phessalia and Desiderius are positively unpleasant. David thinks about their likely activities, and decides to take two negative reputations. The first applies to the other covenants in the tribunal at level 2, for being prone to commit to impossible causes. The second applies to the local peasants at level 1, as dangerous wizards. He takes the 3 negative points for the former and 1 negative point for the latter, for a total of 4.

Overall, then, David has spent seven negative points on Voluntas's Stores, so it has a score of $-3$ in this characteristic.
