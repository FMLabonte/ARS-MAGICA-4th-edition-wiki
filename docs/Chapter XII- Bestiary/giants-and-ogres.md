## Giants and Ogres

Legend says that Cain fathered a brood of monstrous children by a demoness. Over the years these creatures, giants and ogres, have spread across the face of Mythic Europe; some are as tall as trees, while others are human-sized but stronger than bulls. They all have brute strength, often great size, and usually hatred and envy of their more beautiful human cousins. A few have exotic abilities, such as shapeshifting, resisting normal types of damage, or using spell-like powers.

### Hierbent, Giant of the Frozen Wastes

Hierbent is a sullen giant who roams the snowy, windswept peaks, and keeps treasures hidden under massive rocks on various mountaintops. He has a huge, frost-covered beard and carries a mighty axe, which was forged for him by dwarfs. Over the years he has slain seven knights, and is eager to exchange boasts with his opponents before engaging in battle. When the winter is hard Hierbent strides down into the valleys and farmlands to vent his rage. He is always accompanied by a severe storm on these trips into the lowlands.

**Adventure Seed**: An early thaw catches Hierbent farther from his mountains than he would like. As a result he's stranded on a mountaintop near the covenant, unable to cross the warm valleys below. The characters can hunt the giant down to kill him, or they can help him back home in exchange for some of his treasure.

**Powers**:

**Cloak of Snows**, CrAu 40, 0 points: Hierbent is almost always surrounded by swirling snow or sleet driven by mighty winds, even when he is in lowland regions. This makes fighting him difficult (-2 to offensive and defensive scores, and one extra botch roll). This power only works when the temperature is near or below freezing.
