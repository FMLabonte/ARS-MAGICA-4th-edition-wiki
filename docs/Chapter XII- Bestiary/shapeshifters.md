## Shapeshifters

Peasants fear the vicious creatures of the wilds, but dread even more the terrible beings that walk as beasts at night, but appear human during the day. Mortals in beast form are more cunning, bloodthirsty, and magical—and less predictable—than the animals whose shape they take. The most common form adopted by shapeshifters is that of the wolf, but others are possible.

Shapeshifters have many different origins, which determine the power they are aligned with, whether magical, infernal or faerie. Some are inherently magical beings, while others learn magical ceremonies that transform them. Some are people who sold their souls to the Prince of Darkness in return for the shapeshifting gift. Some are of faerie blood and changeable like their kin.

Unless stated otherwise, all shapeshifters retain their normal Intelligence, Presence and Communication scores while in animal form (though the later two are not useful unless the shapeshifter has some way to speak while in animal form). Size and all other Characteristics can be derived by adding the animal's listed Characteristic to one-half (round towards 0) of the character's Size or Characteristics as a human.

For example, a Bjornaer shapeshifter with a Size of +1 and Stamina of –1 who transforms into an animal has Characteristics equal to those of the animal in question, because one half of +1 and –1, respectively, will not modify the animal's traits. However, a character with a Perception of +2 or +3 will turn into an animal which has a bonus of +1 to the animal's listed Perception, because +2 and +3, divided in half and rounded down, still provide a +1 bonus.

Finally, unless stated otherwise, a character's possessions and clothing do not transform with him, and changing shape does not heal wounds (although magi who use MuCo to transform can add requisites to change their possessions). However, changing shape into a form with fewer body levels will not kill a severely wounded character. Unless the shapeshifter is dead, the character will have at least one body level in any form he assumes. For example, a human who has taken three body levels in wounds transforms into a house cat (which only has three body levels). The character retains one body level as a house cat. This level remains until the character is killed in either form.

### Suzaria, the White Werewolf

Suzaria is an intelligent, beautiful, and strong-spirited woman. She learned from her mother how to make a magical salve that she rubs over her naked body atop a magical rock in the woods, by the light of the moon. As long as the moon is in the night sky, she roams the forest as an exceptionally large and beautiful white wolf. At first Suzaria brought down occasional game, but as she grew older her hunger became more ravenous. She has begun killing her human enemies one by one, and soon will have degenerated so far that she will attack anyone who crosses her path.

Local legends about her grow; she is known as “the shadow killer.”

**Adventure Seed:** Suzaria-as-wolf approaches the characters when they are camped in the woods, then flees. One of the characters becomes obsessed with the beautiful animal, but also has a practical reason for wanting the wolf—perhaps a magus desiring a familiar. Eventually that character must choose between destroying Suzaria or allowing her to continue her killing spree.

Stunning Beauty, ReMe 15, 0 points: In wolf form Suzaria is even more beautiful than in human form, and anyone intending to attack her must make a Stamina roll of 9+ or hold back at the last moment. Men suffer a –3 on the roll. The storyguide may call for rolls to make other actions that may harm her, like sounding the alarm when she is spotted, or pointing out her trail to pursuers.

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Muto vis in hair.
