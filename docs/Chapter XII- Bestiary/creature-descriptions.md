## Creature Descriptions

In this rulebook and in supplements for Ars Magica, creature descriptions follow a standard format which varies slightly depending on what statistics and capabilities a given creature has. Most of the statistics are self-explanatory. All creatures have Characteristics. Some have a Might score, and all have a Size. Next come any Personality Traits the creature has—even mundane animals have traits that describe how they react to situations. Combat totals and statistics follow personality traits, and finally, there is a section for Abilities, Powers, and other information.

There are some differences between the statistics of beasts and people. In the case of animals that are not intelligent, their Intelligence Characteristic is replaced with Cunning. Some creatures do not become fatigued (and so have none of the related statistics). You will also note that the levels assigned to Powers do not necessarily match the level guidelines found in the Spells chapter. The level in such cases measures the relative difficulty of countering or affecting the power; it does not indicate that the power is Hermetic in origin.

Combat statistics and other traits, which for characters are based on Characteristics, are handled differently for creatures. For example, Initiative takes Quickness into account, but also depends on the creature's natural adaptations and other abilities. Such scores cannot be derived mathematically from a creature's Characteristics alone; assign them subjectively, based on what seems right to you.

### Designing Creatures

Designing a creature is a challenge, but it becomes relatively easy with practice. You should always begin by asking what purpose it serves in the story. The following items will guide your through the creation process.

- **Purpose:** Why are you creating this creature? Is it to motivate fear, humor, pity, or awe, or just to oppose the characters in combat? How does it fit into the story and what should it do to advance the plot?
- **Image:** What does the creature look like? Sound like? Smell like? How does it move? Does it have distinguishing features that set it apart from others of its kind?
- **Behavior:** What does the creature do, and why? How intelligent is it? What are its goals and motivations? How might it respond to different character actions? Does it have any inherent morality?
- **Basic stats:** What are the creature's statistics? Does it have interesting Personality Traits?
- **Powers and Weaknesses:** Does the creature have any mystical abilities, including spell-like powers? Does it have a special weakness or bane? Are the characters able to know or find out about these powers and weaknesses? Does the creature's body contain raw vis?

### Special Creature Traits

#### Might

Supernatural creatures have Might scores representing their overall power in a realm (divine, faerie, infernal, or magic). Thus, there are actually four different types of Might: Divine Might, Faerie Might, Infernal Might, and Magic Might. A creature's score remains constant, unless it changes as the creature matures. However, it can be effectively lowered when a creature uses its powers. Might has several functions, described below.

- **Measures power:** The Might score gives you a general idea of how powerful a creature is.
- **Indicates realm:** Might scores identify the creature's nature. Supernatural creatures can receive bonuses and penalties to their powers when they find themselves in other realms. See the Realm Interaction Chart on [page 239](../page-refs/page-239.md).
- **Regulates mystic powers:** Some creatures have powers that require an expenditure of mystical energy, limiting their use. The Might score is equal to the number of points the creature can expend; if it does not have enough points left, it can't use that power. All points return within 24 hours.
- **Affects magic resistance and penetration:** Except under special circumstances, a creature gets its Might score as a bonus on magic resistance and penetration rolls. Use the base score for this determination, irrespective of any points expended to use powers.
- **Determines effectiveness of spells:** Many General level spells only work if their level is equal to or greater than the Might score of the creature to be affected. A weakened ghost, therefore, is easier to control than one at full Might.

#### Powers

These are some suggestions for special powers that you can give your creations. Each will vary from creature to creature in strength and other details. Whatever powers you give, however, make sure that they make sense and mesh with the creature's background and natural environment.

Some powers are like spells; this is indicated in parentheses in the creature description. For these, determine a Technique, Form and level equivalent. Even though the creature does not cast spells as a magus does, these stats determine what Arts can resist or counter the power.

- **Animal control:** The creature is able to command animals of a certain type.
- **Constriction:** The creature can squeeze opponents to death, causing damage that increases from round to round.
- **Emotion aura:** Others share the emotions of the creature, such as a satyr that causes those around it to feel wild.
- **Entrancement:** The creature can bind or control people by staring into their eyes.
- **Fear:** The creature instills fear in others, either through a horrible or mighty appearance or through a spell-like power.
- **Fiery/poisonous bite or breath:** Such attacks can cause death, paralysis, insanity, or loss of will.
- **Formulaic spells:** The ability to cast Hermetic spells, as a magus can.
- **Illusion:** The creature has the power to change its appearance, and maybe that of its surroundings.
- **Immunity:** The creature is completely unaffected by certain types of spells or damage. This may be related to the creature's natural habitat.
- **Natural weapons:** This includes teeth, claws, and other spiky bits.
- **Resistance:** The creature gets a bonus on magic resistance or Soak rolls against certain types of attacks.
- **Shapeshift:** The ability to take the form of humans, objects, or beasts.
- **Special senses:** Like seeing in the dark, or detecting lies or magic.
- **Spontaneous spells:** Defined with a Technique, Form, and maximum level.

#### Weaknesses

Weaknesses can and should be as interesting a part of your creatures as its powers are. They let you throw powerful adversaries at the characters, who can in turn survive by finding and exploiting a vulnerability. Learning weaknesses can be part of a story—an important part if the monster is formidable. Like powers, weaknesses should be consistent with a creature's nature, not just tacked on.

#### Raw Vis in Creatures

Many supernatural beasts have vis in their bodies, making them valuable to magi. Generally, the more magical and powerful a creature is, the more vis it has. The kind of vis inherent to a creature is not always obvious, however, and not always immediately logical. Use your imagination: many beasts simply have Animál vis, but poisonous ones might contain Perdo, shapeshifters Muto, and earth creatures Terram.

#### The Creature's Prerogative

It helps to think of creatures as elements of the story. In this role they are mysterious and threatening, a condition you can simulate with the "creature's prerogative." That is, until the characters know what a creature can and cannot do, you are free to make it anything you want. If a developing story calls for it, you can even give the creature a new power in the midst of an encounter. If you are subtle and imaginative—and if you do it to enhance the story, not just smash the characters—the players won't object.

### Magical Creatures

#### Dragonkind

Dragons are the most powerful and noble of all mortal creatures. They are so mighty and rare that dragonslaying is the stuff of legends—a task worthy of a hero or archmage. Dragons are highly intelligent, physically intimidating, and often magically potent. There are lesser brethren to dragons as well: worms, drakes and serpents. Worms usually lack limbs, though some have them. Most are not more intelligent that beasts. Drakes have the general form of a dragon (four legs, serpentine neck, batwings), but are much smaller and often misshapen. They are not typically bright, but are more likely than worms to be intelligent. Serpents are glorified snakes, usually having special powers. They are cunning and often can speak.

##### Sigusen, the Dragon of the Tome

Sigusen is a thin, snake-like dragon with short legs but dexterous forepaws. Forty feet long from snout to tail, he has wings, but no one has ever seen him use them, since he spends all his time in his cave atop a mountain.

Sigusen is writing a great tome on the nature of the universe in an ancient language, and is collecting knowledge of all kinds to support his views. To further his ends, he collects sagas as well. He has several intelligent drakes living with him (perhaps his children) who can take human form. Some say that Sigusen can appear human as well.

Some of the drakes are quite well known as vibrant poets and rakes in the towns they frequent in human form. They seek out scholars and kidnap them, bringing them back to Sigusen for interrogation; scholars can also come to Sigusen for answers to their questions. In either case, though, anyone who doesn't provide interesting information in return is eaten.

**Adventure Seed:** A companion is kidnapped by Sigusen's drakes, and the other characters must find them to get their colleague back. Perhaps the characters must face the great Sigusen himself, to bargain or to fight.

**Vis:** 60 pawns Ignem in heart.

##### The Worm of Abbinton

This creature is 50 feet long, black, and slimy. It has a long head, a cavernous mouth filled with teeth, and three rows of fins down its back. The worm lives in an isolated lake, occasionally devouring fishermen and their boats. It sometimes lumbers ashore for unknown reasons; on land it moves very slowly, except when traveling downhill. Its passage wreaks great destruction on any village it should find.

The Worm of Abbinton has a poisonous breath whose venom is valuable in certain magical experiments.

**Adventure Seed:** The magi need the worm's poison, but probably aren't powerful enough to kill it. A possible strategy is to provoke the worm to breathe on one of the characters, and then drive it away or flee. The characters can then rinse the poison from the victim and collect it for work in the lab. Who volunteers to suffer the poison?

**Characteristics:** Cun 0, Per -2, Pre n/a, Com n/a, Str +9, Stm +9, Dex -2, Qik -3

**Magic Might:** 42

- **Great Breath, CrAu 30, 12 points:** The worm sprays its smoke all around itself, coating everyone within four paces. The worm cannot attack in the round after using this attack.

**Vis:** 12 pawns Perdo in teeth.

##### Ruklin, the Two-Headed Drake

This drake is long and sinuous, and she sports two lizard-like heads on serpentine necks. Her entire body is covered with copper scales. Ruklin has a pair of golden batwings, but it takes some effort to fly; usually she leaps from a high place to make getting off the ground easier. In combat, Ruklin typically bites with one head and exhales flames from the other. In addition, she can use her potent claws.

**Adventure Seed:** Ruklin has information the characters need; they can force surrender if they destroy one of her heads (each takes half of her Body levels). If they cause too much damage, though, she will die and the knowledge will be lost—and what if they kill the head that has the information?

**Characteristics:** Int +1, Per +2, Pre –1, Com 0, Str +8, Stm +5, Dex –1, Qik –2

**Magic Might:** 20

**Powers:**

- **Fiery Breath, CrIg 20, 2 points:** As per combat statistics.
- **Invisibility, PeIm, 4 points:** Ruklin can become invisible as long as no one is looking when she does so.

**Vis:** 14 pawns Ignem in scales.

##### Shashali, the Venomous Riddler

Shashali is a 10-foot-long, drab-colored serpent about as thick as a human thigh. Its head has brightly colored scales that form a fascinating pattern. At the end of its tail is a sharp barb filled with poison. Shashali’s favorite tactic is to distract its target by speaking in a soft voice, while slowly bringing its tail up from the side or rear. It then stings the target and flees. If engaged in a challenging riddle contest, Shashali forgets its murderous intent.

**Adventure Seed:** Shashali has trapped the characters in some way, but they’ve been forewarned of its nature. Can they distract it with riddles and guard themselves long enough to find a way out?

**Characteristics:** Int +2, Per +2, Pre +3, Com +4, Str 0, Stm +3, Dex –2, Qik +5

**Magic Might:** 12

**Size:** –1

**Personality Traits:** Discerning +4, Gullible +1

**Soak:** +4

**Fatigue:** +1

**Fatigue levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Body levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Incapacitated

**Vis:** 6 pawns Perdo in barbed tail.

#### Fantastic Beasts

Fantastic beasts are not just magical wonders like griffins and pegasi, but also include powerful creatures with limited magical ability but incredible physical prowess. Be careful when you design the latter, though, not to make them too dependent on physical strength; give them a healthy Magic Might or they will succumb to the first spell cast upon them.

When modeling beasts after those of legend, consider how true you want to be to the original story. For example, the Minotaur of Greek myth was a unique being, capable of chal

### Minotaurs

lenging a hero's might. Do you want your minotaur to be something similar, an awe-inspiring beast lurking in a maze, something worth telling stories about? Perhaps you visualize your minotaurs as a mighty race with a nasty disposition for human flesh, but nothing truly exceptional.
