## Divine Creatures

Divine creatures are very rare, but often have beneficial powers that make them highly sought after, either for help or for blessing. Their unearthly beauty is matched by tremendous ferocity when confronted by enemies of the divine.

### Alsatia, a Divine Unicorn

Immortal, graceful, and extremely beautiful, Alsatia is one of only a small number of divine unicorns, magical creatures that have received God's grace. They vigorously defend any woman, maiden or no, and relentlessly hunt down rapists and molesters. Alsatia travels Mythic Europe in search of evil, finding and destroying it wherever she can. To anyone with infernal ties she appears dreadful—a shimmering white flame curls off her horn and her eyes glow intensely red.

**Adventure Seed:** A rapist fleeing the wrath of Alsatia insinuates himself into the covenant. A grog patrol is confronted by the enraged unicorn, who can smell the hunted man's scent on them. If the grogs negotiate tactfully with Alsatia and bring her to the covenant, the hunted man takes one of the female covenfolk hostage in order to buy safe passage out. The characters must decide whether to save the woman and allow the criminal to leave, in hopes of catching him later, or to work with the unicorn and secure the woman's release. Alsatia administers swift justice if she gets the chance, and spares none who stand in her way.
