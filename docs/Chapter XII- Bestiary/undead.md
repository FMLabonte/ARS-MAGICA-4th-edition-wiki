## Undead

Somewhere between life and death dwell the undead, those who continue in a horrid non-life instead of finding peaceful rest. Undead beings are all missing some aspect of human life, such as the body in the case of a ghost, or the mind in the case of a zombie. In some ways this weakens them, but in others it makes them stronger.

Due to their magical nature, undead have many powers. Typical powers include resistance to damage from thrusting weapons, since internal organs have no function in the undead; immunity to mind-affecting spells, except for intelligent beings, like ghosts and spirits; immunity to Fatigue loss; causing fear; and entrancement. Some undead can take the shape of bats, insects, wolves, or clouds of vapor. They are often vulnerable to fire, and sometimes their own mindlessness or compulsion can defeat them.

Ghosts are the spirits of the dead who cannot rest, often tied to the world because of some emotional event, such as a violent death or lack of a proper burial. They are especially interesting because of their personalities and magical powers.

Undead can be aligned with the magic or infernal realm. Magi are able to create simple ones by animating corpses, while more powerful beings tend to be aligned with Infernal powers. The examples below are undead that belong to the magic realm.

### Skeletons

These are the bones of the dead, magically animated but without free will. They act under the direct control of the magus who created them, and attack relentlessly until destroyed.

**Adventure Seed**: A magus from a rival covenant has been creating skeletons in the caves under his laboratory. The characters discover this and investigate.

**Characteristics**: Int –4, Per –2, Pre n/a, Com n/a, Str 0, Stm +3, Dex 0, Qik 0

**Magic Might**: 5 (immune to mind-affecting spells)

**Size**: 0

**Weapon/Attack** Init Atk Dfn Dam
**Weapon Style** (determine by weapon)

**Soak**: +8 (+13 against puncture damage)

**Body levels**: OK, Destroyed

### Zombies

These loathsome creations are rotting corpses, forced to walk the earth in service to their master. They are very strong and nearly impossible to stop, continuing to attack if at all capable of movement.

**Adventure Seed**: Raegle is descended from a long line of grave robbers. When he was young Raegle was content with the meager wealth gained from his evil trade, but now he has become a diabolist and has started stealing corpses as well. In his shack in the woods he turns them into zombies to guard against intrusion. The zombies hide up in trees, dropping upon intruders. The characters are sent to investigate rumors of demonic activity in the woods, and encounter the undead forces.

**Characteristics**: Int –4, Per –4, Pre n/a, Com n/a, Str +3, Stm +5, Dex –3, Qik –3

**Magic Might**: 5 (immune to mind-affecting spells)

**Size**: 0

**Weapon/Attack** Init Atk Dfn Dam
**Weapon Style** (determine by weapon)

**Soak**: +12 (+17 against puncture damage)

**Body levels**: OK, –3, Immobilized

### Harlin, a Fiend of the Night

Harlin was an evil woman of magical blood who died in childbirth; she resents the child that killed her and has returned from the grave to slay infants. By day she can take the form of a shriveled hag, but at night she becomes a horrific corpse-like creature. In this form she sneaks into houses and sucks the breath from the lips of children, leaving them cold and lifeless. She can only enter a house that she has been invited into at least once, so during the day she poses as a woeful traveler to gain admittance to houses where babies live. She prefers to flee strong opposition, though will fight ferociously if cornered.

**Adventure Seed**: The death of a child known to one of the characters involves the covenant in the mystery of dying babies. While they are investigating, the magi are blamed for the deaths. The best way to stop the killing would be to find Harlin's now middle-aged son, whose birth killed his mother, and have him convince her to leave off her hate.
