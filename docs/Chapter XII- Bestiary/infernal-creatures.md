## Infernal Creatures

Devils are fallen angels, imprisoned in Hell until the end of time. They cannot leave the Inferno themselves, but their souls can rise to the terrestrial sphere when summoned by foolhardy wizards. In this state they are called demons, evil spirits that walk the Earth.

This dichotomy is somewhat simplistic, since Hell is also home to some infernal creatures that do not possess souls. You might want to refer to the Ars Magica supplement The Maleficium for more information.

### Demonic Strategies

Whatever their exact nature, demons exist in Mythic Europe, and they seek to bring about the downfall of humanity. When they cannot get people to worship them, or to stop worshipping God, they use other methods. Demons especially love destruction; however, this doesn't serve the long-term interests of the Prince of Darkness, as it usually sends people running to the protection of the Church. The soul is the prize; the body alone is as useless to the Devil as it is to his divine counterpart.

Violence is an effective strategy against wizards, though, especially Hermetic magi who are protected from many infernal powers by their Parmae Magicae. Magi are able to harm demons with their spells and are unlikely to turn to the Dominion, which interferes with magic. Thus, demons tend to bring their more overt powers to bear in confrontations with them.

Demons also employ possession, entering the victim's body and taking it over partially or completely and making the person commit "evil" acts. This does not taint the victim's soul, regardless of what the neighbors think. A soul can only be corrupted through a human's free will. Therefore, possession is a less desirable form of attack as well. Demons use more subtle approaches to seek human damnation.

Demons primarily use temptation: some moral dilemma is presented to an individual, who must make a choice with no arm-twisting. In making the wrong decision, the mortal taints his or her soul.

Oppression is a more broad-based attack, provoking emotions that are sinful in nature. The demon creates a general mood that affects large groups of people, by bringing about evil and unnatural events that affect the environment. The oppressive atmosphere sours moods and brutalizes emotions, encouraging people to respond with evil acts and damn themselves. Those who can see the world from a spiritual perspective are immune to this effect.

Obsession is a direct supernatural attack on a victim, brought about by the demon's presence. Obsession is distinct from possession, in that the demon never enters the human body but instead heightens inherent flaws. The basic form of obsession is the phantasm, an evil idea or image that flashes across the mind, usually arising from the victim's own darker wishes. A person who cannot resist these urges taints his or her soul.

Harder to produce and harder to resist is the psychomachia (pseu-ko-mah-KEE-ah, "battle for the soul"): the demon speaks to its victim, in his or her own voice, urging the commission of evil acts. In game terms, any Personality Trait roll is modified by the demon's Psychomachia score, prompting the character to behave sinfully or self-indulgently. The storyguide can also demand a Personality Trait roll from the victim at any time, even when roleplaying and the situation at hand otherwise make it unnecessary.

### Demons and Raw Vis

When their corruptive power touches the Earth, demons often leave behind physical residue in the form of raw vis. Animál, Ignem, Imáginem and Perdo vis are most common. If a demon has no obvious affinity with one of these Arts, it usually deposits Vim vis. Demonic vis is frequently tainted with evil, and can cause unpleasant side effects if used in magic. At the very least, double the number of botch rolls usually required.

When a demon is defeated or destroyed on Earth, its spirit is banished back to Hell. Often it cannot return to Earth for some time, as punishment for failed machinations; failure can also be punished by infernal torture. Because of this, it is exceedingly difficult to recover the corpse of a devil. Such a deed requires a journey to Hell, not lightly undertaken despite the prodigious vis harvest that can reward success.

Some devils are so weak that their spirits only come to Earth in physical form. The corpses of such demons can be harvested for vis. If this is the case, the amount and type of vis available will be set out in the creature description. In most cases, though, the devil's essence persists even if the physical manifestation is destroyed.

Demons and devils are completely immune to fire; spells that detect or force the truth; and spells that make them behave in a kind, compassionate, or virtuous manner.

### Tazzelrik, a Lowly Fiend

Tazzelrik is a freakish demon of quite monstrous appearance. Standing as tall as a man, he has a cow's head; green, shaggy hair and hide; and the legs of a large human—but no torso! He walks with a shambling gait, but is well balanced, and hops around very quickly when trying to avoid detection.

This bestial fiend is more cowardly than brave, but malice is nonetheless evident in his actions. He is nourished by peasants' bad tempers and ill will toward their neighbors. His favorite scheme is to spy on a communal field for a while until he learns of a peasant whose fields are reached by crossing those of another. Tazzelrik then stomps all over the neighboring peasant's crops in the wake of the first. There's bound to be a confrontation, and Tazzelrik's demonic gluttony is temporarily sated.

**Adventure Seed**: The characters come across two peasants arguing in a field, victims of Tazzelrik's mischief. A perceptive group member hears maniacal laughter and sees a green cow's head hopping through the tall wheat. A grand chase through the farmland ensues, ending perhaps in a group dance, courtesy of Tazzelrik's malefic power.

**The Jump Conjoined**, ReCo 15, 2 points: When Tazzelrik hops up and down, all who watch him must make Stamina stress rolls of 6+ or begin to hop along with him and take no other actions. Stress rolls of 9+ may be made each round to break free. This effect lasts as long as there are victims, or until Tazzelrik stops hopping.

### Harkerr, a Senior Pit-Snake Demon

A simple-minded demon who has not yet learned to replace his lust for brutality with subtlety and subterfuge, Harkerr is normally employed as a taskmaster for the other pit-snake demons. He is a "torturer of torturers," who must keep his slaves busy tormenting the many souls that his master has seen fit to put under his supervision. Because of his wonderful capacity for inflicting pain and death, Harkerr is a favored subject of diabolic summoning, and for this reason occasionally appears in the mortal world.

Harkerr appears as a husky man from the waist up, and as a gray-green snake from the waist down. He carries a whip in his left hand and a shield, bound with human leather, in his right. He must strike with his whip to use any of his powers. However, Infernal Might points are spent before rolling to hit, so even on a miss, Harkerr is weakened. He is among the class of warrior demons, and as such only appears in physical form.

**Adventure Seed**: The characters discover evidence of diabolism near the covenant, and begin to uncover a horrendous plot. When they get too close, Harkerr is summoned in a grand ceremony and sent to destroy them.

**Characteristics**: Int -3, Per -3, Pre -3, Com -1, Str +6, Stm +5, Dex 0, Qik -2

**Infernal Might**: 25 (double his normal magic resistance against spells that counter his urge to inflict pain)

### Sainela, Negotiator of the Middle Echelons

This devil was an envoy between two powerful Hellish fiefdoms when a subtle diplomatic mission blew up in her face. As a result she lost her position and is now exiled to the mortal world, stripped of most of her usual powers. Rather than brood the centuries away, Sainela has decided to return to work as a mediator between opposed forces—humanity and devilkind. If her efforts earn the occasional soul along the way, so much the better.

Sainela's specialty is in dealing with people who are not horribly distressed by talking frankly with a demon, such as magi. She is reasonable, patient, even-tempered and quite sophisticated, with a passion for music, art, and philosophy. However, her actual goal is to corrupt those she deals with, through "infernal diplomacy."

A common ploy to nudge innocent souls closer to Hell is offering the target a chance to speak with the shade of some ancient scholar. This is actually a cruel hoax, with lesser demons pretending to be the summoned shade. The target's agreement is a mark in Sainela's favor come Judgment Day, regardless of the reality of the "summoning." Any attempt to disturb a resting soul offends Heaven.

Sainela appears as a stylishly-dressed young woman with a forceful demeanor. Though it is not usually obvious, she also has a short, red, barbed tail. She disappears in a cloud of sweet-smelling, lavender smoke rather than stay and fight.

**Adventure Seed:** Sainela accepts the task of corrupting the covenant or one of its magi. At first she offers seemingly innocuous favors, posing as a young noblewoman, then arranges situations in which the characters need her help. Her goal is for them to accept demons rather than fear them. As she knows she has centuries to accomplish her mission, she's in no hurry.

**Characteristics:** Int +4, Per +4, Pre +4, Com +4, Str -3, Stm -3, Dex 0, Qik +1

**Infernal Might:** 64

**Size:** -1

**Personality Traits:** Subtle +6, Affable +2

|  Weapon/Attack | Init | Atk | Dfn | Dam  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Brawl | +5 | +7 | +8 | +6  |

**Soak:** +5

**Body levels:** OK, 0, -1, -3, Banished

**Powers:**

**Psychomachia:** Pride +4, Curiosity +3, Vanity +1

**Force Words, CrMe 20, 2 points:** Sainela can put up to a dozen words into someone's mouth. The target might be surprised to utter these words, but may be proud enough to defend what they say rather than take them back.

**Hermetic Spells, special, 1 point:** Any Mentem spells up to level 10, and any other spells at up to level 5.

**Create, Cr—x, 5 points:** Creates impermanent items, such as weapons, ropes, tents, and gold. She uses this power to offer people the things they most desire. Created items disappear at the next full moon. The Form and level depend on what is created.
