## Faeries

Faeries are the most diverse and enigmatic of all supernatural beings. Their strength lies in their inherent magical nature, not in their muscle, though some have supernatural strength. Most rely on illusion, deception and other forms of magic to protect themselves.

The goals of faeries are largely incomprehensible to mortals. They lack any need for food and shelter (indeed, none of them ever die or grow old), so are often motivated by a simple desire to amuse themselves. Faeries spend much of their time in games of "let's pretend." They seem fascinated by humanity and play out elaborate games with strict rules, taking on the roles of kings, queens, courtiers, jesters, and knights. Often, the rules require that they do not use powers beyond what their roles permit.

It's not easy to put faeries in a mortal context. Think of them as the wild opposites of Mythic Europe's mundane folk. They are the restless, endlessly creative, playful, unfathomable, and unleashed reflection of stolid humanity. They are closest to the simple, honest people who realize on an intuitive level that there is much within the world that they do not understand and never will. For more information on faeries, you might want to refer to the Ars Magica supplement Faeries.

### Mortals and Faeries

If one truth may be applied to all faeriekind, it is that they are universally repulsed by the divine. Faeries cannot bear the presence of the Dominion and may go into hiding where it holds sway, or move on to more secluded domains. As mortals carry their beliefs with them, they unwittingly drive faeries before them like dust before a storm.

However, even if mortals range into and make their homes in faerie lands, the power of the fay is not always diminished. Mundanes can be so cautious of the faeries' wrath, or so thoroughly frightened by the clergy's warnings, that they dare not set foot in dark woods or virgin mountains.

Faerie power can also endure the presence of humans if tolerant relations are established between the two folk. Commoners and lowly faeries may even exchange goods or services; though to humans the trade may not seem equitable, it may be perfectly reasonable to the faerie mind.

Inciting the wrath of faeries is to be avoided at all costs. Being completely wild, they adhere to no human or divine standard of morality. There's no evident rhyme or reason to the pain and torture they can inflict, and being eternal, they can hold grudges beyond mortal reckoning. Because faeries are so unpredictable, all relations with them are fraught with peril. Magi too would be wise to keep the peace with faeries, for not even Hermetic magic is a reliable defense. Being magical themselves, faeries are highly resilient to spells.

### The Seelie and Unseelie Courts

Faeries that are amenable to dealings with humanity are usually from the Seelie Court. These faeries are of mostly human appearance, but are more noble, regal, and beautiful to human eyes. The Seelie are also incomparable masters of song and music. While members of the Seelie court are the most sociable of faeriekind, their powers are so alien that human life can seem irrelevant and annoying to them.

The Unseelie Court is made up of dark, malicious faeries who often delight in tormenting humans. Generally, these faeries are more brutal and less refined than their Seelie cousins, and can be so vicious that their mere approach is a threat. Their homes are dark pools and silent groves that the wise know to avoid at all times. There are Unseelie castles that can only be seen at dusk, where powerful faerie lords reign; those who visit cannot pass through the gates again.

#### Marlossi, Lady of Light

Marlossi is a high elf of the Seelie Court. At first she seems human, and the only thing that truly sets her apart is the sense of peace and welcome one feels when looking upon her gentle visage. (Those protected by Parmae Magicae do not feel this effect.) She wears a light green gown and simple jewelry. She never leaves the safety of her home, which is in a small faerie wood. She is most often found in the boisterous company of animal-like faeries, and she relies on them to protect her from physical threats.

**Adventure Seed:** The characters are found trespassing on Marlossi's land, but she graciously accepts them as guests. It becomes apparent, however, that she expects them to perform a dangerous task for her; to wit, recapturing an area she once ruled, now controlled by the Unseelie Court. The faeries have been fighting for untold years over the land, but neither side can triumph, for the rules dictate that no wounds count unless at least one mortal is on each side.

**Heal, CrCo 20, 3 points:** Marlossi can permanently heal those she touches, chasing away pain and fear as well. Each use of this power allows for the recovery of a lost Body level. Certain magical or especially grievous wounds might not be healed by this power. After a person receives Marlossi's healing, all Bravery Personality Trait rolls made in the following day receive a +1 modifier.

**Vis:** If struck, she bleeds a white liquid worth 4 pawns of Creo vis.

#### Hybacus, the Feral Musician

Hybacus is a satyr (having a human body with goat legs and horns) whose greatest joy is to play his panpipes while he and his brothers go on their occasional raids into human villages. When such opportunities do not present themselves, he enjoys playing at drunken parties. Hybacus is not as skilled a warrior as his fellows, but they appreciate the music he provides. His piping inspires wild emotions in those who hear them.

**Adventure Seed:** The characters find Hybacus and his rowdy fellows having a party in the woods and are asked to join in. If the characters refuse or are otherwise rude (to satyr sensibilities), they risk being attacked. If they participate in the drinking, wrestling, bragging, and singing, the characters can make some good, if unpredictable, friends.

**Amour, MuMe 20, 2 points:** This music lets those who listen see the beauty in each other and in what is around them, and it raises the desire to possess and please.

**Vis:** 10 pawns Animál in horns.

#### Gizzle, a Goblin of the Mine

Gizzle and his fellow goblins haunt a mine near the characters' covenant. He looks like a four-foot-tall, misshapen man with mottled gray skin. He wears crudely woven clothes (but no shoes), and carries a miner's pick with a bronze head. His boisterous laughter can be heard throughout miles of tunnels. Sometimes he amuses himself by causing cave-ins or stealing miners' equipment that he finds lying about, and when in a vile mood he might attack a miner directly.

**Adventure Seed:** Gizzle and several other goblins have taken over a valuable section of the mine, killing several miners in the process. The characters must act decisively to win the trust of the remaining miners and to keep the mine operating at full potential.
