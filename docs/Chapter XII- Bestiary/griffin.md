## Griffin

The griffin has a lion's body with an eagle's forequarters. It generally attacks with its talons, reserving its beak for tearing the flesh of its prey and for emergency use. Although ferocious when threatened or hungry, the griffin is not entirely malicious; it embodies bravery and hunting prowess. This nature makes it resistant to spells that would cripple or calm it.

**Adventure Seed**: Living atop a rocky crag high in the Pyrenees is a flock of griffins. Dwelling with them is an ancient hermit who is their leader, though he never leaves the nest. He has forgotten how old he is; he speaks only Classical Latin and says he's the Emperor's messenger. The characters encounter the hermit and may want to discover the mystery of his past.
