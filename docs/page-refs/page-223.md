CHAPTER X

MYTHIC EUROPE

223

# The Far South

Beyond Spain and the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea lie the lands of the Moors. Europeans are unfamiliar with their ways and tell stories of kings who are magicians, hunting lions and dwelling in palaces without walls; of a land that is entirely under the rule of the Sun; of knights who breed all manner of wild animals for the greater glory of their king and their god.

## Prester John

It is said that somewhere south or east of the Moorish lands is a Christian kingdom whose ruler is known as Prester John. His lands are the finest in the world, having rivers that run with rubies and hyacinths, and gigantic ants that mine gold from the earth. He, and the hermits who live in his kingdom's towers of stone, are rumored to know the location of Paradise, but angels guard the entrance and no one may pass. Around it, the legends say, grow trees whose fruit cures all sickness, madness, and despair, no matter how caused; this wondrous fruit may even heal ailments that are otherwise incurable.

# The Far East

Far to the east of the Russian principalities, say legends, there are forests too deep for a rider on horseback to pass through. They are reputedly inhabited by pagans and faeries, wild men riding winged horses, and witches with walking huts. Even the most common sorts of beasts are supernatural, and the peasants know no difference between magical and natural things. Beyond that is the mysterious land of Cathay, home of silks and spices, where dragons are said to abound and mysterious sorcerers practice unknown magics.

# The Atlantic and the West

Beyond Hibernia lie the Isles of the West, unnumbered and scattered on the unforgiving sea. Some, it is said, are rootless and move about like beasts, first to one place, then another, and cannot be charted. Sail farther west and you may come to the wild vineyards of Arcadia. Sail too far north, though, and you might find a place where the sun never rises and the sea is living ice that devours ships.

# Mythic Europeans

## The Three Classes

In the Middle Ages, European society was divided into three great classes of people: those who toil, those who pray, and those who war. Each class was supposed to be blessed by God, and worthy of salvation on its own terms. An implicit contract among the three kept each in its place, providing important services for the others. The same holds true in Mythic Europe.

## Those Who Toil

The first of the great classes is the peasantry. A peasant's purpose is to provide the basic needs of life for everyone else,
