THE ART OF MAGIC

the remains of earlier civilizations and in the Muslim scholars and sorcerers who live in this area.

The Novgorod Tribunal is the farthest eastern tribunal in Christendom. It consists of the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Principalities, as well as the Nordic and Slavic lands of the North. Vast amounts of unsettled land and little competition among Hermetic magi for magical resources make this area attractive, but problems with pagan wizards and Mongols can be severe.

# The Grand Tribunal

Every 33 years, three representatives of each tribunal meet at the Grand Tribunal. Held at Durenmar, domus magna of House Bonisagus, those present discuss matters before the Order of Hermes as a whole. The next meeting of the Grand Tribunal will be in 1228. At such councils, the most powerful magi in the Order determine Order-wide policies and reconcile disagreements among tribunals. Intense politicking occurs, and such gatherings are certainly not for the weak-hearted.

# The Order and Society

Magi are prohibited by the Code and Peripheral Code from becoming the hirelings or vassals of mundane nobles. This provides the Order a great deal of protection from mundane affairs. The question, remains, however, how exactly do magi interact with the rest of society?

# Peasants

The relationship between peasants and magi is quite simple. Most peasants fear magi and all things magical, and

thus go within shouting distance of a covenant only if a dire emergency occurs and they have nowhere else to go. For the most part, magi find this a desirable circumstance, as they are not bothered as they immerse themselves in their arcane experiments. On the other hand, it does present some problems. It makes grogs hard to find, and food hard to come by. It also makes magi the convenient targets of blame for misfortunes ranging from dysentery to drought.

Magi are able to overcome most of these problems in part by fostering a relationship with those peasants who live near their covenants. Magi often provide services for the peasantry in return for food and service, and this arrangement can lend itself to other forms of cooperation. In areas where a covenant has stood for quite some time, relations between the magi and peasants can be almost friendly.

Peasants who are outcasts from society have little to lose from consorting with magi, as long as they can overcome their fear of the magical. Convicts often find sanctuary in the homes of magi, as few are brave enough to follow them there. Likewise, those who are ill or crippled may throw themselves on the mercy of magi, hoping to be cured of their ailments. In return, they offer their lifelong service.

# The Church

There is a very complex relationship between magi and those who represent the Church. Although many clergy think in very simple terms that "thou shall not suffer a witch to live," others who are well educated know that there is nothing diabolic in the magi of the Order. Such clergy often enjoy having philosophical discussions with magi at a level that most people can't comprehend. Of course, some magi are Christian themselves. They participate in all the ceremonies of the Church, and in this sense, magi and the clergy are allies against diabolic forces. Many clerics, however, cling to the belief that all magic is either from God or Satan, and those magi who are obviously not holy must be destroyed. Some go so far as to condemn the entire Order as Satanic.

The Church, of course, is involved in all sorts of mundane affairs—the Reconquista, the Crusades, the various heresies—and although assisting the Church does not violate the prohibition against working for mundanes, most magi would prefer to let study and experimentation occupy their time. Of course, some magi have fought in the Crusades and reconquest, much to the delight of the clergy. As long as some magi continue to help the Church, those who do not will probably simply be ignored.
