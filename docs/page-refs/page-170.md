ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

ryguide assigns the object a Soak score and a number of Body levels. Your Damage Total is your Damage score plus the amount by which your Attack Total exceeds the assigned ease factor. For every full five points by which your Damage Total exceeds the object's Soak, the object loses one Body level.

The storyguide should assign Soak scores and Body levels based on the resilience of the item and the amount of punishment it can sustain before being destroyed. For example, a door might have a Soak score of +10, and 5 Body levels, while the side of a large tent might have a Soak score of +0 and 3 Body levels. Once all an object's levels are depleted, it is irreparably damaged. The more frail an object, the lower a Soak score and the fewer resistance levels it has, while the sturdier the higher the Soak score and the more levels it has.

# All Out Attack or Defense

There may be times when you want to throw caution to the winds and press the attack at the expense of defending yourself. Conversely, you may not care about damaging your opponent, but only care to keep your skin intact. In either of these cases, you may use an all out attack or an all out defense.

When engaging in an all out attack, you may add a +6 to your Attack Total against a single opponent. To balance

this, you may not add your Defense score to a Defense Total against any opponent during the round.

With an all out defense, you may add +6 to your Defense Total against a single opponent. You may not cause damage to any opponent during the round.

# Botches in Combat

These combat rules tell players who wins a fight and indicate how much damage each side suffers, but they alone cannot simulate all the life-threatening, anxiety-provoking, and even humorous things that can happen on a battlefield. Botches add unpredictable possibilities into the mix.

In combat (as in any other stressful situation), when a stress die comes up 0, botch dice are rolled. As a general rule, assume that multiple botches are that many times as bad as a single botch. In general, a one-die botch (when one zero comes up on the botch dice) is not harmful, only embarrassing or inconvenient, while a four-die botch could very well be highly injurious or perhaps fatal. It is up to the storyguide to determine the exact effect—no chart or table can substitute for a good imagination.

# Armor

Armor is important—it helps prevent characters from sustaining grievous wounds in battle. Two factors describe
