jects, such as cathedrals. Traveling work gangs move from town to town, helping to erect large buildings. Because construction can take so long, these "itinerant" workers can become, for all practical purposes, citizens of a city.

# Guilds

Trade and commerce are the lifeblood of towns, and guilds govern these important enterprises. Merchant guilds regulate the behavior of traveling traders, also serving as a mutual aid association against the dangers of the road. Most townsfolk are more familiar with the craft guilds, which include everyone from humble cobblers to wealthy goldsmiths.

Craft guilds insure all members produce work of adequate quality for fair and uniform prices. No member can work longer hours or employ more apprentices than any other, nor advertise his or her wares to the detriment of another member. After all, unfair competition breeds dissent, and dissent breeds poverty for all. Guilds also provide aid to members who are sick, and funeral expenses and support to the families of members who die.

Cities offer opportunity for all who can work in an honorable profession, including women. Wives and daughters can join the guild of their husbands and fathers, and widows often inherit their husband's business and position. Many guilds admit all women of good character as members, and a few, such as those for spinning and block printing, employ only women.

# Advancement

The system provided by the guilds is generally fair and good. A youth is apprentice to a master, and works for room, board, and education during the years necessary to learn the craft. After learning the basics, the apprentice becomes a journeyman. Journeymen must still work for a master, but are paid for their labors.

After spending enough years to fully master the craft, a journeyman may petition the guild council for full membership. To do so, he or she usually must create a "masterpiece" to demonstrate his or her skill, and present it to the guild. If the work is judged acceptable, the journeyman swears an oath to uphold the guild, and becomes a master. He or she then has the right to sit on the guild council, work for whomever he or she will, and take on apprentices. In this way the guild assures all masters are fully conversant with their chosen craft.

# Education

Cities are also centers of learning. Well-to-do children of all social classes are taught the basics of reading by their parish priest, and almost everyone gets some instruction in religion. Church schools can also provide some of the basics of a formal education. Even though books are hard to come by, and written by hand, many people of substance own a few.

This is the age of the university: the most important cities, such as Paris and Oxford, have one. Students generally study for three years, after which they take examinations. Each who passes becomes a baccalaureus, who can then assist in teaching. After three more years of study such assistants become masters. Both men and women can be students and masters in most universities. Law, medicine, theology, history, rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic are the subjects commonly studied.

Though classes may be held in rented buildings or even in rough sheds, no one has greater pride than the educated. Students and their masters are part of a guild, much like the craft guilds. Students who attend the university of their home town are its champions, living together and challenging rivals as a group.

As long as they pay their tuition, students are responsible only to their masters, who in turn answer only to the Church. Students often flaunt their unique freedom and mock the nobility by going about armed with daggers and swords. Indeed, the reputation of students as lewd, irreverent, drunken, and rowdy is often well deserved. It is no surprise that nobles and students often come to blows.

# Money

What modern people think of as money, whether it be coins, bills, or any other abstract form, is a convenience rather than a necessity. If all money suddenly vanished off the face of the world, a lot of people would be angry, but the basics of life could continue. True wealth is measured in solid goods of value.

The basic unit of value is land. Land provides food, clothing, and shelter; without it, you would die. For that reason, only those who are crazy or truly desperate will sell it. Instead, people barter items of value whose worth depends on the land's bounty, such as grain and livestock. However, these are not easily exchanged physically, and require that there be a significant surplus on hand. Therefore, a symbol
