ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

You turn yourself (or another, if you use vis) into a tree about 12 feet high, with a trunk about a foot thick. The target can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a tree. The target can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While in tree form, the target does not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The tree branch you use determines the kind of tree the target becomes.

## Level 40

### Cloak of Mist

R: Per/Touch D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Powdered Agate (+1)

Requisites: Auram, Aquam

You turn yourself (or another, if you use vis) into a thick, cohesive mist of approximately human size. You can float through the air at walking speed and can see and hear what is going on around you. You can also seep through cracks, but cannot move through solid objects. You return to human form at any time, but doing so ends the spell. As mist, you are subject to the forces of the wind. If an agate is used, you throw it over yourself or another, and as it falls, the target fades to mist.

### Transform to Water

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Water Just Melted from Ice (+3)

Requisite: Aquam

You turn yourself (or another, if you use vis) into water, one pint for every pound of the target's weight. As water, you can hold yourself together unless someone makes an effort to separate part of you from the rest. You can roll slowly across the ground, but cannot move uphill. You can hear sounds, feel things that touch you, and can sense temperature. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. You cannot resume human form if a significant part of your body/water is separated from the rest.

## Level 45

### The Silent Vigil

R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Essence of an Earth Elemental (+3)

Requisite: Terram

You can move into and become part of a rock formation that is at least twice your size. While in the stone, you can hear what is going on around you, but you cannot use other senses. The spell lasts until you come out, and you must come out where you went in. You have no need for food or drink, though you do age. Rolls to recover from Fatigue or wounds take twice as long to make while you are in the stone. Casting requisites are required for items you take with you into the stone.

## Level 50

### Mists of Change

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Spec, Ritual

Requisites: Animál, Auram

As this spell is cast, a whipping wind arises and patches of mist begin to roll across the landscape. Sometimes, a patch of mist suddenly envelops a person for a few seconds, during which time the victim cannot move. When the mist blows away, continuing its course, the person is left transformed into a random creature. Roll a simple die to determine the result: 1—Wolf, 2—Horse, 3—Brown Bear, 4—Large Toad, 5—Ferret, 6—Viper, 7—Boar/Sow, 8—Dog, 9—Cat, or 0—Other (storyguide picks; be cruel). People transformed retain their human minds, but inherit all the passions and instincts of their new forms.

The mist covers an area within a 1-mile radius, the center of which must be in sight when you cast the spell. The mists affect the area for an hour. Generally, the mists affect one in ten of the people caught in the radius. To see whether a given person falls victim, make a simple roll. A zero indicates the spell affects the person.
