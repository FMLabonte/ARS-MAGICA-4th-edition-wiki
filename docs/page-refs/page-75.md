# Spellcasting Options

## Mastering a Spell

When you gain experience points, you can use them to master spells. Usually, you may assign no more than one point to a given spell per story, though more than one point might be assigned with the storyguide's permission if the experience was awarded for an entire season or more at once. When you accumulate a spell's magnitude in experience points, you have mastered it.

When casting a mastered spell, you always roll a simple die, unless you are using vis to boost the spell (see "Using Raw Vis" on page 77). If you are using vis to boost the spell, roll one less botch die. In addition, you gain a bonus of +1 to all Concentration rolls involving the Mastered spell, and may attempt to multiple cast it (see below).

## Multiple Casting

You can cast several copies of a single mastered spell so that it affects more people, objects, or areas (as applicable) than normal. A single target may also be affected more than once. Only mastered spells may be multiple cast.

When multiple casting, you must first roll a stress die + Finesse + Intelligence – the number of spells to be cast. If this result is greater than 9, you proceed to cast the spells. If it fails, your action is wasted.

Each spell must be rolled for separately (as normal, save that each roll is reduced by the total number of spells being cast). If any of the spells fail outright, you lose the fatigue and the spell fails, though others may still take effect successfully. If you lose consciousness, any spells that were successful still run their course. If you lose consciousness and accumulate additional fatigue loss, each additional fatigue level causes an extra hour of unconsciousness.

Subtract the total number of discrete targets from any targeting rolls that are required. Even if all spells are directed at the same target, a -1 applies. The storyguide can further penalize or prohibit multiple casting that is especially difficult, such as casting two spells in opposite directions.

For example, say a given magus multiple casts three Balls of Abysmal Flame (page 136), two at a single target and one at another. The Finesse + Intelligence roll is made at a -3 (for the number of spells), the spell rolls are made at a -3 (for the number of spells) and the targeting rolls are made at a -2 (for the number of separate targets).

## Fast-Cast Spells

To cast a spell safely you need time to draw together and control the energy that powers it. Formulaic spells always require a given amount of time to cast. Even spontaneous spells require a small measure of time. If you're daring or desperate, though, you can cast a spontaneous spell even more quickly than normal; this is called fast-casting. Fast-casting a spell entails gathering the energy and expending it before the normal precautions are taken to control it. You may have to take this risk to defend yourself against an incoming attack or spell, or to react to a sudden mishap or accident. Fast-cast spells are also used to defend against attacks that magic resistance and natural resistance cannot defend against. For example, if an enemy magus causes a tree branch to swing down and strike you, you can fast-cast a spontaneous spell in response to make the branch swing wide.

There are three steps to determine the success of a fast-cast spell: compare speed, roll for casting, and determine spell potency.

As the situation demands, compare your stress die + Quickness + Finesse + Encumbrance to the stress die + Quickness + Finesse + Encumbrance of another spell caster, to the Initiative Totals of those attacking you physically, or to an ease factor set by the storyguide. If your opponent's total is higher than yours, their spell or attack beats your fast-cast spell. In this case, you must roll to maintain concentration before you can cast a spell (presuming you still wish to cast it at that point). This is a normal concentration roll, based on any interruptions you've suffered.

Next, roll for your spontaneous spell and subtract 5 before dividing the roll. That is, roll Technique + Form + Intelligence - 5, divided by 2 if a Fatigue level is spent or divided by 5 if not. If you roll a 0 when fast-casting, you must roll three extra botch dice.

Fast-cast defenses have very limited range, duration, and potential for seriously affecting targets, as their levels tend to be low. The duration of most fast-cast counterspells is Momentary.

You completely ward off a spell attack if your total equals or exceeds half the penetration of the attacking spell. Otherwise it penetrates anyway. When defending from mundane attacks, a spell total of 10 protects you from a single attack, 15 from up to three known attacks, 20 from any number of known attacks, and 25 against all attacks, known or unknown. These results assume that your spell is appropriate to defending against attacks: a Perdo Ignem spell, for instance, may stop flaming oil from harming you, but will be ineffectual against axe strokes.
