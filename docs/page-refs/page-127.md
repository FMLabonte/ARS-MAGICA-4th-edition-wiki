CHAPTER V
SPELLS
127

# Level 15

## Dust to Dust

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Bones Ground to Dust (+3)

Turns a dead body or mindless undead body to dust in two rounds. The spell doesn't affect those undead possessed by spirits. Rubbing two or more bones together to make dust during the casting of this spell enhances the effects. To do this to an animal corpse requires a Perdo Animál spell.

## Grip of the Choking Hand

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Branch of Holly (+3)

The target feels an invisible, strangling hand on the throat. Each round, the target loses a Fatigue level, or a Body level if already unconscious. It requires a Stamina stress roll of 6+ to break the spell, rolled each round. If using the holly spell focus, you point the branch towards the victim while you cast the spell. Holly is dangerous for magi to carry, as peasant superstition holds it to be a harmful plant and it may therefore attract unfavorable attention.

## The Wound that Weeps

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: +0

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+1)

When casting this spell, you point at the victim, possibly with a branch of holly, and a large wound opens on his or her body. The wound is not a deep one, but it bleeds profusely.

The target must make a Stamina stress roll ever round. If the result is a botch, he loses two Fatigue levels. If the result is 2 or less, one Fatigue level is lost. If the result is 3 to 8, no level is lost. If the roll is 9+, the bleeding stops. An unconscious target loses Body levels instead of Fatigue levels. A target who is active suffers a -3 penalty to these Stamina rolls, and a completely still target receives a +1 bonus. Of course, accumulated Fatigue and wound penalties apply to all rolls. If outside help is received, a Chirurgy stress roll of 6+ stops the bleeding.

# Level 25

## Bane of the Decrepit Body

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Heart of an Old Man (+3)

The target ages 5 years. Determine afflictions normally. This spell does not work on children younger than age 16. If casting with the focus, you slowly crush the heart, draining the years from the target.

## Confound the Connection

R: Spec, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: A facsimile of the connection used against you (+5)

Allows you to destroy an item used by another magus as an arcane connection either to you or someone you touch. Use of this spell assumes you know an arcane connection has been made to you or the person you touch, though you don't have to know what item is being used to form the connection. Once this spell is cast, the arcane connection is destroyed. Another connection can only be formed by a magus if he has another of your personal objects.

# Level 30

## Incantation of the Milky Eyes

R: Reach/Sight, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Blank Glass Eye (+3)

Blinds a target, leaving the eyes milky with cataracts.

## Twist of the Tongue

R: Near/Sight, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Human Tongue (+3)

Twists the target's tongue into a spiral, completely destroying the ability to speak. A grave offense to a magus.

# Level 40

## Clenching Grasp of the Crushed Heart

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Human Heart (+3)

When casting this spell, you make a clenching motion with your hand, crushing the spell focus if using one. The victim doubles over at once, and if the victim fails to make a Stamina stress roll of 15+, he or she dies with a crushed heart. If the target's roll succeeds, 5 points of Stamina are still lost; the target is still probably crippled for life, and may die an early death.

## Curse of the Leprous Flesh

R: Touch/Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Flakes from the Skin of a Leper (+1)

This spell causes a person's flesh to rot off in a matter of weeks—truly hideous sight. Much of the target's flesh literally hangs from his or her frame, and there is a pungent rotting smell about him at all times. Every week, over a period of three months, the target must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or lose a Body level permanently. On a botch, an additional Body level is lost. The target also loses a point of Stamina by the time the spell ends. The magic can be dispelled while it is still in effect, but any damage done is permanent. If the victim somehow survives this curse, he is shunned by mortal communities. If you are casting the spell with flakes from the skin of a leper, you blow them on the victim.

## The Kiss of Death

R: Touch/Near, D: Mom, T: Ind

The person you kiss dies a sudden death. The only mark on the corpse is the black imprint of your lips. No words or gestures are necessary, though if you apply vis to range, you can "blow" a kiss of death. The target is allowed a Stamina stress roll of 12+ to resist.

# Level 55

## Curse of the Unportended Plague

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual
