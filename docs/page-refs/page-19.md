CHAPTER II

CHARACTERS

iars, which they call "substitute" heart-beasts. On the other hand, other magi are wary of followers of Bjornaer because of their fascination with the bestial. Furthermore, House Bjornaer is less respected than it might otherwise be because its founder was from a Germanic rather than a Roman magical tradition.

# House Bonisagus

Bonisagus (BOH-nee-SAH-goos) invented the Hermetic theory of magic, and his student, the maga Trianoma, masterminded the formation of the Order. As such, House Bonisagus has always enjoyed a great deal of respect from other magi. Most members of this house believe themselves to be of a privileged, gifted elite.

Some Bonisagus magi refine and expand Hermetic theory, while others oversee the continued political development of the Order. Both types have a strong tradition of using their knowledge and power for the benefit of the Order. Selfishness is strongly discouraged.

# House Criamon

This very secretive house is known for its obscure philosophy, its disdain for simple power, and its members' habit of marking their faces and bodies with arcane symbols. Followers of Criamon (KREE-ah-mone) are an enigmatic and otherworldly group of magi, generally having little interest in the politics of the Order.

Magi of Criamon seek the "Enigma," which other magi characterize as some sort of mystical experience. For followers of Criamon, understanding the Enigma has a great deal to do with discovering the true nature of Wizards' Twilight and of magic itself.

# House Ex Miscellanea

This is a large, diverse, and highly disorganized collection of magi. Though originally founded by a renegade as a rival to the Order of Hermes, this association was eventually accepted as a house of its own. It accepts wizards of all kinds, many only nominally Hermetic, whose magic comes from many disparate traditions. Magi Ex Miscellanea (EKS mis-kel-LAH-nay-ah) are often called hedge wizards by their many detractors within the Order, and in fact, most of its membership originated in the peasant class.

The Symbol of House Flambeau

# House Flambeau

While most followers of Flambeau (flahm-BOH) specialize in fire magic, some study spells of simple annihilation as a more subtle alternative. These aggressive and ferocious magi often cause trouble within the Order and frequently anger mundanes. However, their fearlessness and love of destruction make them invaluable when the Order requires the application of martial force.

# House Jerbiton

House Jerbiton (YARE-bih-tahn) is interested in the mundane world, and sometimes assumes the duty of keeping the Order on good terms with the nobility and Church. This inclination in its members often stems from a noble background—apprentices are usually taken from the aristocracy, and often maintain ties afterwards.

Many members of other houses believe that followers of Jerbiton are too closely bound to the mundane powers to be trusted. On the other hand, Jerbiton magi fear that members of the Order have become isolated from humanity, risking bloody conflict with the mundanes. They try energetically to heal this rift, and pursue aesthetic and Classical knowledge with a passion.

# House Mercere

The founder of this house lost his magical powers but remained involved in the Order. He assumed a non-magical role valuable to other magi—that of messenger. His followers continue to fulfill that role. All members of House Mercere (mare-KAY-ray, or mare-SARE in vulgar Latin),
