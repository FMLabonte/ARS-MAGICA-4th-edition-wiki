# Engagement Example

Alberto and Bors have been fighting two thieves, Frederico and Inigo, and with Frederico injured, are pressing their advantage. Alberto declares he will move to engage Frederico in Reach with his sword, using the class single weapon (Frederico managed to disengage from Alberto last Round). Bors declares he will move to engage Inigo at Close range with his spear, using the longshaft class. The storyguide declares that Frederico will be routing, attempting to run 30 yards into cover without engaging or being engaged by any one. He declares Inigo will move to engage Bors at Touch range with his dagger, brawling with him.

Bors rolls the highest Initiative Total of 18, followed by Inigo at 13, Frederico at 11, and Alberto at 10. Since Bors and Inigo wish to be engaged at different ranges, they have an engagement contest. Bors has the higher Initiative Total, and so they wind up engage at Close range, giving Bors a +5 (18–13) first strike bonus. Inigo cannot attack Bors (because Bors is outside the range of his dagger). Frederico manages to get away without Alberto engaging him (since his Initiative Total was higher), and Alberto is left with nothing to do but chase Frederico, or perhaps engage Inigo next round.

combat may move up to half of their movement at the selected speed and still fight. If they must move more than that, they do not have time to both move and engage their opponent. They must engage next round, but can still gain the bonus for charging, presuming that they did in the previous round.

A character on horseback may move up to his full movement and still engage in combat. However, if he moves more than half of the horseback movement and then engages, the object of the charge has the opportunity to stand and fire a missile weapon, provided that he has one ready. Resolve the missile fire at Near range, and then resolve melee as normal.

If any character declares intent to engage another, an engagement contest may occur. The outcome of this contest determines whether there will be an actual engagement and at what range it will occur. To resolve an engagement contest, combatants compare their Initiative Totals. The winner of the engagement contest is the one with the higher Initiative Total, or in the case of a tie, the combatant who declared the largest range. After the engagement contest, the range between the combatants is set at whatever range the winner declared. Furthermore, the winner gets the difference between Initiative Totals as a first strike bonus, which can be added to either his Attack Total or Defense Total this round.

Sometimes the loser of an engagement contest will be able to close distance to the winner, even if the winner wished to engage at a high range. This occurs most often when an archer is firing at an approaching foe. If a character declares intent to engage at Far, Middle, or Near range and wins the engagement contest, that character may fire at the stated range. However, the character that lost the engagement contest is still allowed to use his full movement to approach the archer, possibly coming as close as Reach range. Characters who do manage to close in this way may attack, provided that they only moved half of their possible movement, as described above.

If two combatants wish to be engaged with one another at the same range, no engagement contest is made—both get their wish. Therefore, once two opponents are engaged, an engagement contest is only resolved during a round when one of the combatants attempts to change the range between them. In cases where the range status quo is maintained, no first strike bonus will apply to the combat since no engagement contest has occurred. Since the first strike bonus simulates not only speed, but the advantage gained by engaging your opponent at a range that is disadvantageous to him, it does not apply when the combatants agree on range.

Engagement with missile weapons is slightly different. A character who suspects that he might be the target of a missile attack must “engage” his opponent in order to defend by dodging or some other means. No contest is required, the target simply needs to be aware of the number of enemies that he has engaged.

If the result of the engagement contest puts a combatant’s opponent outside of his weapon’s effective range, he
