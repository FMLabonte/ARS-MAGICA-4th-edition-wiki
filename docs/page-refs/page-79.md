CHAPTER III

HERMETIC MAGIC

nent's roll of a stress die + Stamina + Certámen. For every full five points by which you exceed your opponent, your opponent loses one Fatigue level. Penalties for these Fatigue levels lost apply immediately to further rounds of certámen.

If you save your excess points for your next roll, you hope their addition to that roll gives you an even greater excess score in the next round. However, if your next comparison roll against your opponent is low, you may lose the advantage you had in the previous round. It's a gamble to hold on to points from one round to the next, but doing so can help keep you consistently ahead in the contest until such time as you make a roll that truly devastates your opponent.

Relevant Affinities can be applied as bonuses to certámen rolls. The magus who chooses the Form of the battle chooses the shapes of the phantasms used. So, if you have an Affinity with wolves and choose wolves as the phantasms, you get your Affinity bonus to your certámen rolls.

There are three ways to win certámen. The first involves wearing your opponent down until he falls unconscious. When this happens, the victor is entitled to cast a single spell at the loser. This spell, which must be of the same Technique and Form of the contest, circumvents the loser's Parma Magica (though the loser still gets a magic resistance roll based on the Form of the spell). In most certámen contests, this "free" spell is unnecessary, because your opponent's collapse already designates your victory. However, some duelists use it anyway to intimidate and embarrass those who fight them. This free spell can be used to harm your fallen opponent, but remember, certámen is intended to be a harmless way to resolve disputes.

The second way to win certámen is by surrender. If your opponent realizes he is outmatched, or wants to walk away from the duel, he can concede the con

test. Such a submission means that loser is still capable of defending himself, so he has full Parma Magica and Magic Resistance against any final spell cast at him.

The third way to win certámen is to maintain concentration in the face of distraction when your opponent does not. Concentration rolls are not necessitated by the loss of Fatigue levels during certámen. Sometimes, however, conditions surrounding the duel necessitate that the duelists make Concentration rolls. If one of the duelists fails a Concentration roll, the fight ends. The duelist's loss of concentration causes his phantasm to disappear, indicating the opponent's victory. A victor through loss of concentration does not get a free spell.

Loss of concentration, however, does not necessarily mean that certámen is over and that a victor is decided. If the victor under these circumstances refuses the honor, and the combatant who lost concentration agrees, the battle may resume until a clear victor emerges. A magus might refuse a victory by loss of concentration for reasons of honor, or because he intends to do more harm.

You can use raw vis at any time during certámen, even if your opponent doesn't use it or doesn't expect its use. For every pawn you expend, add 5 to a single contest roll. This bonus applies to your rolls that involve Form and Technique, not to rolls that determine Fatigue levels lost by your opponent. Raw vis used must be attuned to one of the Arts used in the duel, either Form or Technique. The number of pawns you can use in one round is limited to your score in the Form or Technique the vis is attuned to or your certámen score, whichever is lower.

If the duel is integrated into a melee situation, rolls for certámen are made in the magic phase of the round. Magi involved in certámen can do nothing else until the duel is resolved.
