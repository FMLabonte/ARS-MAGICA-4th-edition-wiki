CHAPTER V
SPELLS
151

# Level 25

## Tracks of the Faerie Glow

R: Near/Far, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Mushroom from a Faerie Ring (+1)

Causes even faintly perceptible tracks of a specific being to glow with a faint magic light, making them stand out when you are within 30 paces of them. The glow provides a bonus to Tracking rolls, which depends on the relationship between the target being tracked and the terrain. If the target is magically related to the terrain, +2; native to the terrain, +4; neutral to the terrain, +6; inimical to the terrain, +8. Tracking at night without a light source doubles the bonus. The more faint the tracks are, the more dimly they glow, so the storyguide may also modify the bonus based on the length of time since the target passed. You need something intimate to the target (an arcane connection) to trail it. The spell focus is scattered over the area where you expect to find tracks.

# Level 30

## Stone Tell of the Mind that Sits

R: Reach/Near, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: Dirt in Your Mouth (+3)

Allows you to talk with natural stone. A typical question and response takes one hour—stone speaks slowly. Though a stone is usually willing to talk, its direction sense and awareness of quickly moving things (such as people) are limited.

## Sense the Feet that Tread the Earth

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Bound, Ritual

You touch the earth and feel what is moving along the ground within the natural area where you stand. You can tell the direction, distance, weight, number, and manner of movement of moving things. For instance, you might sense "a single 50-stone creature slithering toward us, a hundred rods in that direction."

# Level 40

## Greeting the Maker

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Small, Ritual

Gives you a vision of the maker of an item and the process (up to fifteen minutes worth) used to create the object. When used in conjunction with magical investigation in the lab, this provides a +5 to the Investigation roll, and, in any case, gives a hint about the nature of the item being studied.

## Muto Cerram Guidelines

The targets below are for changing dirt. To change sand, mud, or clay, use the same level of magnitude as for dirt. To change stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To change metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude.

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

Level 3: Change the shape of of dirt.

Level 4: Change one property of dirt.

Level 5: Change dirt to another type of natural earth (for example, sand to loam).

Level 10: Change dirt so that it is slightly unnatural (requisites may be required). Change dirt into a liquid or gas (with requisites). Change dirt to stone, or vice versa.

Level 15: Change dirt so that it is highly unnatural (requisites will often be required). Change dirt into a mixture of liquids, solids, and gases (with requisites).

Level 20: Change dirt into a slightly unnatural liquid or gas (with requisites).

## Muto Cerram Spells

### Level 3

### Supple Iron and Rigid Rope

R: Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Bit of Iron or a Bit of Rope (+3)

Makes a flexible object stiff or a stiff object flexible. Casting requisites of Forms appropriate to the materials affected are required.

### Level 5

### Edge of the Razor

R: Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Small

Sharpens any metal edge to a degree unequaled by manual methods. An edged or pointed weapon gains a +2 bonus to Damage. Good-natured magi reward grogs by enchanting their weapons in this way.

### Level 10

### Object of Increased Size

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Chunk of Masonry from a Castle (+1)

This spell enlarges an inanimate object originally no bigger than a large chest. The object doubles in each dimension and increases its weight eight times. The size increase is based on the object's original, natural size, so casting the spell more than once on an object has no effect. Noble elements like gold, silver, and gems, are not affected by this spell. If any part of the item resists growth, the item as a whole does not grow. Casting requisites are required for the appropriate Form for the target.

### The Crystal Dart

R: Reach/Far, D: Mom, T: Small

Aimed +4

Spell Focus: A Rock Crystal (+3)

Requisite: Rego
