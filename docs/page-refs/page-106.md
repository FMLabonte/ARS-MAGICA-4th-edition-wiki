ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Many of the spell descriptions include visual descriptions, hand gestures, spell foci, and wizard's sigils. It should be noted that these are all examples and that you shouldn't feel bound by them. In fact, you should customize all your spells in ways appropriate to your own magus. When you give special details to your own customized versions of these spells, you are rewarded with more a interesting game.

## Natural Resistance

Circumstances where natural resistance rolls are allowed are detailed in spell descriptions. Natural resistance rolls are most often Stamina, Size, or Intelligence stress rolls.

## Notes on Techniques

### Creo

A Creo spell might grow back a severed hand or create a bird, but it cannot grow wings on a person (that would be a Muto spell). Things created are either independent or a natural part of a larger being or object. Independent objects usually appear in your hand or directly in front of you.

You cannot create things inside of people to harm or kill them, nor can you perform other tricky maneuvers unless a spell specifies you can. Nothing created by magic is ever permanent unless vis is used to extend the duration of the spell.

### Intellego

Intéllego lets you perceive things or see through them. An Intéllego Terram spell, for instance, can let you see through walls. Intéllego cannot affect the subject of its spells (the person or thing you're watching), save that those who are sensitive to magic (for example, those with magic resistance) might realize they are being spied on with it. Intéllego spells are always of limited duration, even when extended with vis.

### Muto

There are two types of Muto spells, those that change the shape of an object and those that change the substance of an object. Although Muto spells are normally of limited duration when vis is not used, the shape of an object may be permanently changed if the substance is altered, because although the original substance eventually returns, the shape may not. For example, a Muto Terram spell can be cast to change a stone wall into dirt, which falls to the ground. The dirt eventually becomes stone again, but is now a pile of stone, instead of the wall it once was.

Muto spells that change the size or weight of a target cannot be used multiple times in order to cause the target to continue to change. A spell that doubles a creature's size, for instance, doubles its normal size, not its current size. To triple a creature's size, a more powerful spell is needed.

### Perdo

Most Perdo spells affect their targets directly, using no intervening medium. Therefore, targeting rolls are rarely needed. Perdo spells with the duration momentary destroy something in a moment. The duration does not describe how long the object is destroyed, as the effects of the destruction last until the target regenerates itself (which could very well be never).

### Rego

A Rego spell does not change the target, it merely moves or controls it. For instance, you can slam someone into a wall with a Rego spell. The easiest way to move things is to move the whole object evenly. To spin the object or to move just part of it is usually more difficult.

## The Wizard's Sigil

When you invent a spell, some amount of your personal magical style is likely to manifest itself, giving the spell some small quirk or minor detail that identifies it as yours. This recurrent mark or quirk in a magus's spell (which doesn't usually change the effectiveness of the spell) is termed his "wizard's sigil." Once known, these quirks can identify certain magi as having cast certain spells. Throughout this chapter, various sample spell sigils are listed in the descriptions. Keep in mind that these are just guidelines. They're meant to give you ideas to better personalize your spells, and perhaps to aid you in choosing your own sigil.
