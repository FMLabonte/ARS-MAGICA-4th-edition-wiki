CHAPTER V
SPELLS
131

# Level 15

## Hunt for the Wild Herb

R: Touch, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Leaf from a Cypress Tree (+3)

When you cast this spell, the vegetation of the forest guides you (or the target of the spell) to the nearest specimen of the type of plant you seek, as long as you (or the target) continues to concentrate. You must have a sample of the type of plant you are looking for. A Perception stress roll of 6+ is needed to follow the subtle signs, which include pointing branches and inclined trunks. A plant of the type you seek must be within the forest you occupy, or the spell fails automatically.

## Shriek of the Impending Shafts

R: Per/Touch, D: Conc/Moon, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Hazel Wood Rod (+1)

Lets you know where anything wooden will be in the immediate future (in the next few seconds) by a shriek that sounds in the air in advance of the wood's coming. You get a +9 bonus on Defense scores against wooden weapons (provided that you have the freedom to dodge and have engaged the wielder), and you can automatically dodge wooden missiles fired from greater than Near range unless so many are coming at you that you can't get out of the way, in which case the ease factor of shots is still modified by +3. Missiles from archers in Near range or closer still have to add +6 to their normal ease factor to strike you.

# Level 25

## Converse with Plant and Tree

R: Touch/Far, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Chewed Leaf (+1)

You can speak with a plant for one conversation. The level of conversation depends on the type of plants; longer-lived and more noble plants have more to say. A single question and response takes ten to thirty minutes, with slower-growing plants speaking more slowly. Typically, plants can talk about the soil and about other plants around them, but have limited awareness of more momentary events, such as the passing of animals or people, unless that passing has a direct bearing on the plant (for example, a person cut its trunk). News can spread quickly through a forest when it has to, called from tree to tree on the wind. Bystanders cannot understand your conversation.

# Level 45

## Calling the Council of the Trees

R: Per, D: Moon, T: Bound, Ritual

You call all magical and potentially mobile trees within the forest where you cast the ritual to the site of the ritual. The trees are not compelled to come, but will likely be interested in whoever has called them. Trees in a faerie forest are especially prone to responding. Once gathered, the trees hold meetings, summon ancient powers, and discuss the problems facing their kind. You may speak, and understand what the trees are discussing. The results of the conference may not be entirely in your favor. The trees remain animated for a month and may seek to return home before the end of that period.

# Muto Herbam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

These guidelines assume that when you change a plant, it's still a plant in some way. Changing a plant into something else usually involves a spell one level of magnitude higher than the guideline most appropriate to the action. To change plants into treated or finished material (for example, wooden furniture, a vegetarian meal, linen or cotton cloth) add one magnitude to the level necessary to change plants into natural, unworked plants.

Level 5: Change a plant or item made from plant products.

Level 10: Change a plant or item made from plant products into metal or stone (Terram requisite).

Level 15: Cause a plant to bend or twist rapidly in place.

Level 20: Affect the consciousness and spirit of a plant.

# Muto Herbam Spells

## Level 5

### Transformation of the Thorny Staff

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Rose Thorn (+3)

Causes a length of wood (up to 6 feet in length) to grow thick, sharp thorns at whatever spots you touch. If the spell is cast on a staff, the thorns do +4 Damage the first time a hit is scored, after which the thorns break off.

## Level 15

### Dance of the Staves

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Small Twig (+1)

Causes a pole, staff, haft, or any other long, thin, non-living wooden object to bend and lash about wildly for a few seconds and then stop suddenly, keeping its new, twisted shape. A whirling staff strikes its holder and does +4 Damage, with a possible bonus if the weapon at the head of the pole hits the person.

### Rope of Bronze

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Bit of Bronze (+1)

Requisite: Terram

Turns a piece of rope (made from plant material) into refined, superior bronze, which does not break under normal circumstances. If a bit of bronze is available, it is touched to the rope during the spell, triggering the change.

### Thaumaturgical Transformation of Plants to Iron

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Bit of Iron (+1)
