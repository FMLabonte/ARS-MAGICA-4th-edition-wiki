CHAPTER X

MYTHIC EUROPE

of the exchange—money—replaces the actual goods. Gold and silver coins make the ideal currency: precious metal is portable and for the most part without practical use.

Gold and silver coins in medieval Europe are not like modern money, but are rather a medium of barter. Instead of exchanging tangible goods, like chickens or bread, for a needed item, a purchaser uses an equivalent value in gold or silver. The advantage of a coin is that its value is easier to ascertain than that of a nugget or gem.

Keep in mind another point about medieval money: it's evil. Any desire for profit beyond what is necessary to stay alive is considered a sin. Lending money with an interest charge is usury, though opinions differ on what level of interest is sinful. Just to be on the safe side, moneylending and many other merchant enterprises are often left to those whom medieval Christians think are damned anyway—Saracens, Jews, and Italian banking families.

# Coins

Many peasants in Mythic Europe live out their lives without ever using a coin. Anyone dealing with poor people may have to barter in goods of like value: a meal, a dozen

eggs, a yard of cloth, or perhaps a special service from a craftsperson. Establishments that regularly serve travelers have special arrangements, since their goods or services are usually costly enough to necessitate payment in coins. In cities, coins are more common, and every town has merchants whose business involves dealing with them.

Unlike modern currency, medieval coins don't identify their own value. Each is a piece of precious metal that is printed with the mark of the lord or cleric that had it made, as well as with some identifying image. The mark signifies the weight of the coin and the percentage of pure gold or silver in the metal. The fancy picture keeps it from being counterfeited, and offers the wealth and fame of the coiner as a guarantee of authenticity.

It is always in the best interests of a lord to make his or her own coins, if people will accept them as good. That way, the lord knows those coins, at least, represent a known quantity in payment. However, the personal fame of the lord counts for much. People are generally much more willing to accept the coins of the king of France than they are those of the count of Toulouse.

# Paper Money

Paper money of a sort does exist in the Middle Ages, in the form of checks. A noble can write a letter of indebtedness to a banking house or to another person and sign it, creating an easily transported voucher that can be redeemed on demand for its value in gold or silver. A deed of ownership of land can fulfill the same function.

An endorsed check has additional signatures (endorsements) of rich and influential people. In theory, their signatures vouch for the check-writer's honesty; in practice, if the original writer doesn't honor the debt, the endorser has to come up with the cash. Obviously, the best checks are the ones endorsed by an archbishop or a monarch.

# The Order of Hermes

The roots of medieval wizardry go back millennia to the Nile valley, to ancient Mesopotamia, and beyond, but the continuity of this tradition was broken with the fall of Rome. In the subsequent period of chaos and violence the practitioners of this ancient art were separated and left living in fear. The creation of the Order of Hermes in the 8th
