THE ART OF MAGIC

# Wizard War

The Code allows for a conflict between two magi to escalate to open conflict in certain conditions. When those conditions are met, the two magi involved may step outside the bounds of the Code temporarily to settle their differences. One magus initiates a Wizard War by sending a declaration of war to the other. The message must arrive on the next night of the full moon. The war then begins on the rise of the following full moon, and lasts until the rise of the next full moon after that.

Unjust or constant use of Wizard War is discouraged by the majority of level-headed magi. Occasionally, those who declare war too often find themselves victims of a Wizards’ March.

# Tribunals

Tribunal was initially a term reserved only for what is now known as the Grand Tribunal—the first and original tribunal of the Order. Now, however, it refers to any one of the thirteen different officially recognized and regularly held councils of the Order, as well as the specific geographic areas over which these council meetings hold sway. Each tribunal holds council every seven years, settling disputes between magi and covenants, and dealing with other pressing business.

# The Hermetic Oath

“I, Bonisagus, hereby swear my everlasting loyalty to the Order of Hermes and its members.

“I will not deprive nor attempt to deprive any member of the Order of his magical power. I will not slay nor attempt to slay any member of the Order, except in justly executed and formally declared Wizards’ War. I hereby understand that Wizards’ War is an open conflict between two magi who may slay each other without breaking this oath, and that should I be slain in a Wizards’ War, no retribution shall fall on he who slays me.

“I will abide by the decisions made by fair vote at tribunal. I will have one vote at tribunal, and I will use it prudently. I will respect as equal the votes of all others at tribunal.

“I will not endanger the Order through my actions. Nor will I interfere with the affairs of mundanes and thereby bring ruin on my sodales. I will not deal with devils, lest I imperil my soul and the souls of my sodales as well. I will not molest the faeries, lest their vengeance catch my sodales also.

“I will not use magic to scry upon members of the Order of Hermes, nor shall I use it to peer into their affairs.

“I will train apprentices who will swear to this Code, and should any of them turn against the Order and my sodales, I shall be the first to strike them down and bring them to justice. No apprentice of mine shall be called a magus until he first swears to uphold this Code.

*

“I request that should I break this oath, I be cast out of the Order. If I am cast out the Order, I ask my sodales to find me and slay me, that my life not continue in degradation and infamy.

“The enemies of the Order are my enemies. The friends of the Order are my friends. The allies of the Order are my allies. Let us work together as one and grow hale and strong.

“This oath I hereby swear on the third day of Pisces, in the nine hundred and fiftieth year of Aries. Woe to they who try to tempt me to break this oath, and woe to me if I succumb to the temptation.”

* At this point, followers of Bonisagus recite: “I shall further the knowledge of the Order and share with its members all that I find in my search for wisdom and power.” Others recite: “I concede to Bonisagus the right to take my apprentice if he should find my apprentice valuable to him in his studies.” The Peripheral Code extends Bonisagus’s right to claim apprentices to followers of Bonisagus.
