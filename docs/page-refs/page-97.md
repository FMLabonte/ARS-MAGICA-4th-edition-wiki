# The Third Season

## Tempering the Bond

In the third season, you strengthen the bond between you and your familiar by evoking certain magical powers through the bond. These are abilities you and your familiar manifest together. You choose what qualities you wish to evoke. See "Bond Qualities," below, for the powers you may choose from. You and the storyguide then decide how those particular qualities affect you and your familiar.

You have a number of points equal to your full bond score to buy bond qualities. Negative bond qualities provide you with additional points for purchasing positive bond qualities, just like Flaws provide extra points for Virtue purchase.

Almost all bond qualities affect both you and your familiar in some related way; they characterize your bond. By choosing bond qualities you are determining how the physical, mental, and magical qualities of each of you affect the other. In addition, almost all bond qualities are accompanied by the exchange of some minor physical, mental, or (rarely) magical quirk or habit related to a particular bond characteristic. For example, if you choose a bond characteristic that increases your awareness of each other, then you might each gain some minor habit linked to each other's special sensory strengths: for example, a magus with a dog familiar may sniff people when he first meets them, whereas the dog scrutinizes the text of signs and book covers.

You and the storyguide must agree on all changes that you and a familiar undergo during the formation of the bond. There are several factors you can consider to choose these changes. Perhaps your magic Arts indicate the type of powers the familiar receives. Perhaps the qualities you receive from your familiar are based on the beast's abilities, either natural abilities, such as a cat's ability to see in the dark, or on any natural magical Powers the beast may have possessed before it became your familiar.

See "Bond Qualities" for powers you and your familiar may share. The qualities listed can be considered guidelines, and you may create any new bond quality you like, provided it works similarly to those shown and you get the storyguide's approval. Some tales tell of magi who invest familiars with superior powers and abilities by actually reducing their own powers and abilities. However, the nature of the bond between familiar and magus requires that the magus gain something in return, though the boon gained to offset a given loss of ability may be subtle.

# The Fourth Season

## Closing the Enchantment

In the fourth season of the familiar's enchantment, you simultaneously complete the enchantment and close it so that it cannot be dispelled, which takes another three pawns of Vim vis. From then on, you have a familiar, independent but loyal. At this point, determine the remaining statistics for your familiar.

# Bond Qualities

You may never take the same quality more than once, unless the description says you can. If a quality is noted as "ranged," it applies when magus and familiar are within 100 paces of each other unless the specific quality states otherwise. You may not take bond qualities that are incompatible or that overlap in their scope. The storyguide has final judgment on which bond qualities can be taken together.

## +5 Bond Qualities

**Attunement**: You may attune one of your familiar's natural magical powers to Hermetic magic. You must do this for all your familiar's natural magical powers (5 points each time) before you can choose any other bond qualities.

**Awareness**: Ranged. Each of you always knows where the other is, in terms of both direction and approximate distance. You each gain one habit or quirk from the other related to your particular sensory strengths (see "Tempering the Bond").

**Exchange Virtues**: Your familiar gains one of your Virtues, and you gain a Virtue related to one of the familiar's natural abilities, or to one of the natural magical Powers that it had before becoming your familiar. Note that you do not lose the Virtue that you exchanged for another.

**Extended Bond**: The powers of your bond, including the powers of the three cords and all ranged bond qualities, work when the two of you are within one mile of each other, not just within 100 paces.

**Linked Targets**: Ranged. Whenever either of you is affected by magic, either beneficial or hostile, the other is fully affected as well.

**Material Bond**: Your familiar gains +1 in a physical Characteristic (Strength, Stamina, Presence, Dexterity, Quickness) that you have that is higher than your familiar's, and you gain +1 in a physical Characteristic that your familiar has that is higher than yours. You choose the Characteristics to be exchanged. If you cannot each contribute a Characteristic to the other (for instance, because all your familiar's Characteristics are lower than yours), you cannot take this bond quality. You can take this quality multiple times, but your Characteristic scores may be raised to no higher than +7 in this manner. Along with this bond quality, you each gain some physical appearance trait of the other.

**Mental Bond**: Your familiar gains +1 in a nonphysical Characteristic (Intelligence, Perception, Communication) that you have that is higher than your familiar's, and you gain +1 in a nonphysical Characteristic that your familiar has that is higher than yours.
