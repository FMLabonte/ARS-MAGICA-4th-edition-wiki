CHAPTER VIII

SAGA

![img-56.jpeg](img-56.jpeg)

Be dramatic about the end of a saga. It will likely be the last time the players have a chance to play their characters, so they should feel a satisfying sense of closure. Keep in mind the atmosphere and motif of the saga. If there was a rainstorm at the beginning, describe a lifting storm in the final scene. It reflects the saga's passing and suggests a change from the start, indicating that the characters' lives have had some effect on the world. Even though some may have died in the course of the saga, they're not forgotten.

What separates great sagas from mediocre ones is careful balance. The best dramas make us laugh as well as cry. Your saga does not have to end with the death of all its characters, nor with everyone living happily ever after. Maybe the characters must sacrifice the life of a loved one to save a kingdom, making for a bittersweet conclusion. Think about the endings of your favorite books, movies, and even other campaigns. If you think about why you liked them, you will probably find some clues about how you might present an excellent finale.

Once a saga is complete, take the time to thank everyone for their participation. The fantastic stories you've told

have been a group effort. You, as storyguide, painted the scenery, but the heroic deeds of the player characters supplied the rich detail that filled in the foreground.

# Story Ideas

Much of your time between game sessions is probably spent in contemplation of new story ideas. Inspiration can come from many sources, books and movies being quite predominant, but it's important to go beyond them. If you get most of your ideas from a particular film, what happens if everyone in your troupe has seen it as well? Instead, try to make your stories an amalgamation of good ideas, surprising those who think they know where the plot is headed.

What follows are some traditional types of Ars Magica stories. Although these story ideas are not unique by any means, you can tailor them to the needs of your troupe, using them as springboards for your own original stories.

# Exploration

The exploration of new areas, from enchanted glades to fetid catacombs, offers a great deal of excitement. Exploration gives the members of the troupe an opportunity to broaden their horizons and perhaps boost their reputations. It is a time to introduce new characters to your saga, for new lands mean new acquaintances. You can also use such adventures to expose characters to new customs and fresh ideas.

Rumors and stories usually get characters interested in the journeys they must undergo. Clues planted in musty texts can motivate magi to get out and explore the unknown. They might encounter people that they know little about, or might stumble upon ancient legends just now coming true. The rewards from such adventure can range from physical riches to a wealth of knowledge.

# Tribunal

Magi, usually no more than three, must travel to a tribunal from time to time to represent their covenant in matters of interest to the entire Order. Tribunal stories are perfect for a large group. You might even invite people to participate who don't normally play, to make the story even more complicated, and to initiate new players to the game.
