become widespread. The character with the Reputation “Thief 3, among residents of Paris” will not increase his Reputation by being caught picking pockets, because that is expected of him. On the other hand, his Reputation might increase if he steals something very valuable, or commits some other high profile crime. Of course, if he was successful in stealing something of great worth and no one found out about it, his Reputation would not increase, because news that he did it would not be widespread. Reputations are decreased in the same way, save that the actions performed must run contrary to the Reputation.

# Confidence

Confidence represents a character's solid belief in his ability to accomplish his goals. It is measured in points. Most of the people in Mythic Europe have one Confidence point. Most characters begin the game with three.

Characters can use Confidence to help them succeed at tasks. Any time you must make a stress roll to succeed in some action, you may put Confidence into the action, adding +1 for each point you expend. If you succeed, no points are lost and you can use them again later. If you fail, you lose those points temporarily, gaining them back in a week or two, or when you succeed at some vitally important task without using Confidence.

If you ever use Confidence and your total score to perform the action comes out to exactly what you needed,

|  Travel Chart  |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Difficulty | Foot | Horse | Wagon  |
|  Easy | 25/1 | 30/1 | 15  |
|  Light | 20/2 | 25/1 | 10  |
|  Medium | 15/2 | 20/1 | 8  |
|  Hard | 10/3 | 12/2 | 3  |
|  Very Hard | 5/3 | 3/2 | —  |
|  Terrible | 2/3 | 1/2 | —  |

The number before the slash is the number of miles traveled in an eight hour traveling day, assuming several rest stops. The number after the slash is the number of Fatigue levels lost. Generally, these fatigue levels must be slept off.

immediately make a simple roll. If your roll exceeds your Confidence (including any points temporarily lost), you permanently gain one Confidence.

If you should happen to botch while using Confidence, you lose a Confidence point permanently (though you cannot lose your last point this way). The only way to drop to 0 Confidence is to suffer extended dehumanizing treatment, like slavery or torture, or to experience something that destroys your will to live, like losing your true love.

# Travel

Travel time between important scenes is generally played through quickly. If little of interest happens on the road, you don't want to waste time detailing every moment of the journey. The rules below determine how long it takes for characters to get somewhere, and how tired they are afterwards.

First rate the difficulty of travel according to the categories listed below, based on the terrain and weather. Travel is at the pace of the slowest member of the group.

**Easy:** The best (and rarest) of circumstances, such as a straight, level Roman road with a gentle breeze at the characters' backs.

**Light:** A combination of the best weather travelers can realistically hope for, and a good road (by medieval standards).

**Medium:** Typical conditions for travel, on a rocky road with holes and ruts caused by rain and heavy wagons. This could also describe travel on a better road with unfavorable weather conditions, such as heat or snow, or travel through a moderately dense forest with a competent guide.

**Hard:** Travel on a typical road with less than favorable weather, or unescorted travel through the wilderness.

**Very Hard:** Unbearable weather, such as a blizzard or hurricane, or horrible terrain, such as a sloping rock field.

**Terrible:** Both harsh weather and hazardous terrain. One does not usually travel under such conditions, as fatalities can result.

For each day of travel, each character (or horse) rolls a stress die + Stamina. On a 6 or greater, one less Fatigue level than normal is lost. On a botch, some traveling misfortune occurs, such as an injury.
