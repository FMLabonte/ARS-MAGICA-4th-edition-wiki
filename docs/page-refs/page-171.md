the armor a given character wears: what it is made of and how much of it the character is wearing. The Armor Table at the end of this section lists the statistics for each type of armor available in Ars Magica.

## Materials

Quilted cloth, a thin layer of leather, or layers of leather-strap-wrapped fur or cloth is the most basic of armor. Using very thick leather, or hardening leather by wax impregnation or baking, makes a better material for deflecting crushing damage. Using further reinforcements to the leather through the application of studs, rings, or other metal pieces strengthens it against slashes and cuts. Breaking the leather up into a flexible array of scales allows the use of thicker pieces of leather. Replacing the leather scales with small overlapping metal plates again increases protection while retaining flexibility, although metal weighs slightly more. At the top of 1220 technology lies chain mail, a suit of flexible metal made of links of chain. Included here for completeness is old Roman armor, made of linked segments of hard metal plates. The Lorica Segmentata had no full body version, which will have to wait for the invention of plate mail. In any case, characters are not likely to begin the game with such armor.

## Outfittings

The hauberk is the basic part of a suit of armor. It consists of a piece of protective material covering the torso, including the upper arms and shoulders. Although it can be cut back to only a cuirass, some kind of shoulder and upper arm protection, be it only cloth, is almost always included. Haubers are generally one piece, with fasteners reaching

from the neck to knees. A hauberk can be put on without help.

Half armor consists of a hauberk augmented by some additional protection: a gorget (a piece of neck protection), a half helmet (which protects the crown and back of the head), vambraces (covering the forearms), and chausses (for basic leg protection). The half helmet gives a -1 penalty to all Perception rolls when worn.

Full armor is the most protective suit, worn by warriors who have the strength, money, and time to get all the pieces and put them on. A full suit includes everything a half suit does, and further augmentation. Additions are a coif, helmet with camail, or full helm for total head protection; elbow and knee cops to protect those delicate joints; gauntlets for full hand protection; and full leggings and greaves to protect the shins and lower legs. Understandably, this is a difficult ensemble to put on, taking some time and at least one other person's help. The full head protection gives a -3 penalty to all Perception rolls when fully in place.

## Armor Improvements

It is possible to change the protection values of the armors listed in the chart by subtracting or adding material. The values listed for the Protection and Load are the optimal values the material can give. Those wishing to improve their armor without purchasing the next more expensive materials can attach more of the same. For each +1 added to the Protection given, an additional point of Load is added. The Protection value of a given armor cannot be more than doubled by this method.

If desired, a hauberk can be reduced to a mere cuirass by removing the shoulder and upper arm protection. Reducing the Protection by 2 reduces the Load by 1.
