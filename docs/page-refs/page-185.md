CHAPTER VII

STORYGUIDE

aside the rules if your troupe's imagination is more powerful.

One factor in effectively staging Twilight is timing. If an episode occurs during a battle, it is best to simply have the afflicted character fall into fits and leave it at that. Don't slow things down for the rest of the players. If, however, a magus experiences Twilight while the other characters are free to interact, you may wish to draw out the scene for full dramatic effect: the affected character fights for control while the others try to ease their fellow through the experience.

The immediate effects of Twilight are up to you, as storyguide. Sometimes the magus is simply knocked unconscious or paralyzed; at other times, he may suffer violent fits. Uncontrolled vis often leaks out of an afflicted magus, causing strange magical effects. Fit the nature of a given Twilight to the dramatic needs of the story and the atmosphere of the saga.

In addition, most Twilight episodes leave some kind of mark on the character, called the "touch of magic." This can be a physical discoloration, a quirk, or any other minor interesting detail. Again, this should suit the nature of the Twilight or of the character.

## Other Causes of Twilight

Wizard's Twilight does not always occur entirely by chance. It can be more common under certain rare conditions. Below are some examples.

**Powerful magical items:** These potent devices rely on the user's ability to control magic, so they can only be used by wizards. Their powers are so strong, however, that any botch made while wielding them causes a risk of Twilight.

**Magical traps:** A magus might inscribe a tome with a "spell" that actually sends anyone attempting to cast it into Twilight, as a trap for those who steal the book.

**Supernatural encounters:** Demons and faeries can use powers that do not mesh perfectly with Hermetic magic. Magi who are trying to discover the secrets of such beings may find themselves going through Twilight as a result.

## Experience and Advancement

A character's identity, outlook and competence change as the saga progresses. Experience points, which are spent to improve a character's statistics, are a palpable measure of this change. They can be gained in the significant encounters of a character's life, through interaction with the world, and through study or training.

All of the methods for gaining experience listed in this section (save for story experience) require full seasons of devotion to training, practice, study, or what have you. Characters so occupied may not spend more than ten days out of the season engaged in other activities. Exactly what counts as an "other activity" is up the storyguide. Traveling
