CHAPTER III

HERMETIC MAGIC

duce will have the default range, duration, and target for the Art combination you are using. (These defaults are listed for each combination in the Spells chapter.) If you do specify otherwise, see “Ranges, Durations, Targets” on page 103 to determine how changing those parameters changes the level of the spell.

For example, a magus comes upon a small stream with a rocky bank. The magus doesn’t wish to get his feet and robes wet crossing the stream, so contrives to cause some of the rocks to arrange themselves as stepping stones across the stream. He knows no formulaic spell that will do this, so decides to try a spontaneous one. The appropriate arts are Rego (because he wants to move something) and Terram (because he is moving rocks). His relevant Arts are 10 and 6, respectively, and his Intelliegne is +3. He is not encumbered. He decides that the success of this spell is not extremely important, so elects not to fatigue himself. As the situation is not stressful, he rolls a simple die, getting a 7. His total, then, is 10 (Rego) + 6 (Terram) + 3 (Intelligence) + 7 (his roll) = 26. He divides by 5 (because he didn’t fatigue himself), generating a spell of level 5. Checking the Rego Terram guidelines in the spell chapter, we can see that he has just been able to move a Small amount of dirt. He has not succeeded in moving the stones as he wanted, but nevertheless, a handfull of nearby sand scatters itself sympathetically across the path he desired for the stones.

Had the magus elected to fatigue himself, the total, 26, would have been divided by 2, for a total level of 13. He is able to move a Small amount of rock (probably constituting one of the stones he hoped to move) into position.

If you have a formulaic spell in your repertoire that produces effects similar to those you are trying to produce with a spontaneous spell, you can get a bonus on your spontaneous spell roll by spending one full minute considering the similarities between the effects of the formulaic and spontaneous spell. The bonus is equal to the magnitude of the similar spell. See “Similar Spells,” below. If you are at all disturbed during the period of contemplation, an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 6+ is required to maintain contemplation. Otherwise, you fail to pin down the similarities between your spell and a formulaic one, and receive no spell roll bonus.

## Similar Spells

When casting spontaneous spells, it is helpful to know a formulaic spell that produces a similar effect to the one you are attempting. For two spells to be similar, they may only differ from each other in one of the following ways.

- The range, duration, and target are different.
- The details of the effect are slightly different. For example, one of the spells produces something of a slightly different shape, or moves in a slightly different way.
- The learning or casting requisites are different.
- The two spells have different restrictions. For example, one of the spells requires an arcane connection or a certain material component.
- The strength of the effect is different. For example, one of the spells does a different amount of damage, or produces a different intensity of light.
- The type of target is different. For example, one targets people and the other targets animals, or one targets stone and the other targets metal.

If the two spells fall into more than one of the categories listed, they are not similar.

## Casting a Formulaic Spell

To cast a formulaic spell, your character recites magic words in a firm voice and boldly executes arcane hand gestures memorized as part of the spell. This activity shapes and directs the magical energy that pervades the world.

When casting formulaic spells, the die rolled is a stress die if you are in stressful circumstances or a simple die otherwise. Add the appropriate type of die, the appropriate Technique and Form, your Stamina, and your Encumbrance. If this total is greater than the level of spell you are attempting, the spell is cast successfully and you lose no fatigue. If the total is between the spell level and the spell level minus 10, it is successfully cast but you lose one Fatigue level. If the total is lower than the spell level minus 10, the spell does not take effect and you lose a Fatigue level.

When you successfully cast a spell, make sure that you remember what your roll was, because it might be used immediately to see if you overcome the target’s Magic Resistance (see “Magic Resistance” on page 72).

## Casting Ritual Spells

Ritual spells require much more energy and concentration than standard spells, and thus the process of casting them is different. These spells perform major feats, exceeding some of the limits of formulaic and spontaneous spells.

Formulaic and spontaneous spells are normally limited in the following ways:
