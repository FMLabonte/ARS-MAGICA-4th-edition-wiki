CHAPTER IV

LABORATORY

Once you have chosen the effect, you spend a season, add your aura to your Lab Total, and compare the total to the level of the effect. For every 5 points, or fraction thereof, by which you exceed the level, you get one dose of the potion. If your Lab Total is exactly equal to the level, you get one dose. If your Lab Total is less than the level of the effect, and you are not using vis in the potion (see below), the season is wasted in your attempt.

Though it is not required, you may wish to expend raw vis when creating potions. If you want the potion to have the longer of two durations listed for a spell (which is especially important for healing spells), you must put Art-specific vis into each potion just as if you were casting the spell—that is, one pawn per 5 levels of the effect. You may also expend even more Art-specific vis to increase your Lab Total, receiving +5 per pawn used. If vis is used but your Lab Total still doesn't exceed the level of the effect, the season is wasted, and you lose all the vis you used.

When the potion is used, the target undergoes the effects of the spell copied. The effect might not be obvious. For example, a potion that lets the drinker fly has no noticeable effect until the person jumps into the air. The target makes normal magic resistance rolls against the effects of a potion, even if the target wants the potion to affect him.

The term potion refers to any salve, incense, paste, powder, ointment, or similar substance you wish to make; though potions are often in liquid form, they don't have to be. When you create a substance similar to a potion, you have to indicate how the substance is applied—salve is applied to the body of the recipient; dust is sprinkled over the recipient; incense is inhaled by the recipient. The storyguide may give you a bonus to your Lab Total if you choose a form for your substance that's especially suited to the effect it produces.

# Longevity Potions

Your time to study and increase your power has an ultimate deadline: your inevitable demise. In their attempts to gain themselves more time in this world, the magi of Hermes have developed longevity potions. Though death is still inevitable, these potions can stave off death for a hundred years or more. Magi of two hundred years or older are rare, but not unheard of.

The longevity potion acts as a magical anchor, sustaining the vital life force of the magus, often by directly affecting the tissues of the magus's body. This anchor, however, prevents the magus from expending his life force in normal human fashion, so the magus becomes permanently sterile. Though called a potion, the longevity effect may be imparted through any number of media. Charms, potions, clothes, and tattoos are just some of the possibilities, each one having unique properties. A longevity charm, for example, has to be worn constantly to provide its preserving power; if it were removed, you could die immediately, or you might slowly fade away until the charm was returned or a new longevity "potion" created. A tattoo, on the other hand, might be better, as it is more or less a part of you; it might begin to fade after the longevity "potion" in your system fails, serving as a gauge of your decline.

Every magus has a unique formula for his longevity potion, and the potion that a magus uses for himself is of no benefit to another, though it is possible for a magus to make a longevity potion for another.

The first stage in creating your longevity potion is determining what ingredients you need. You may do this in one season if your Intellego Corpus Lab Total (including your aura) is greater than 20. If it is not, you cannot invent a longevity potion. After determining (and acquiring) the proper ingredients, you merely spend 1 pawn of vis per five
