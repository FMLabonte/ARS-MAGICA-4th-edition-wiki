THE ART OF MAGIC

# Enchanting a Familiar by Experimentation

When enchanting a familiar (see "Familiars," page 94), you add the simple die to the strength of the bond you create, thus increasing both the number of points from which you purchase ratings in the cords and the number of levels of powers exchanged. Any results from the "Extraordinary Results Chart" are applied to all the powers you grant and all that you receive. The troupe may choose to have you roll separately on the chart for each power exchanged, or may apply the results of a single roll to all powers exchanged. Powers that are gained but altered by the chart cannot be changed or revoked.

# Inventing Potions by Experimentation

Even with the help of experimentation, your Lab Total may not exceed the level of the spell being invested into a potion. In that case, you fail to produce the potion, lose any vis used, waste a season, and must still roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart."

If the potion's invention succeeds but comes out flawed according to your roll on the chart, you may attempt to create the potion again by normal means another season. Your Magic Theory score (that at the time of your experiment) is used as a bonus to your attempt to reinvent the potion, as you have learned from your nearly successful experiment. Thus, your Magic Theory is applied twice to your Lab Total for reinventing the potion.

You may also experiment on longevity potions, adding the simple die to your Lab Total. This bonus increases the potency of your potion, giving you greater resilience against the affects of aging. If your potion is flawed by a roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," you may recreate your potion next season and add your Magic Theory score as a bonus to your Lab Total for that potion (thus Magic Theory is applied twice to Lab Total).

# Investigating an Enchanted Item by Experimentation

The simple die is added to every roll made to discover an item's invested powers. If you cannot bring your Lab Total high enough to discover an item's powers, you still have to roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," though.

When investigating an enchanted item by experimenting on it, you take risks not normally taken, and may damage or destroy the magic item in the process. Any results from the chart indicating damage or changes to the project you are working on are applied to the magic item or one of

its powers. It's possible, though, that a magic item's own protections can preserve it from the dangers of your experiments. If the level of an item's protecting power (like Magic Resistance or an appropriate spell) exceeds your Lab Total (including any bonus for experimentation), the item resists any damaging effects rolled on the chart.

# The Laboratory in Play

Laboratory activities take up most of your life as a magus, so you should take some care in deciding both your individual laboratory activities and your attitude towards your laboratory and your creations. Your laboratory itself is an important reflection of your personality, as it is where you spend much of your time. Take the time to think about what your sanctum looks like and what's in it. Does it bear protective spells? Where do you sleep? What do you have in your lab, and where do you keep it? Do you hide your most prized possessions? Is your laboratory clean and well kept, or a disorganized mess where no one but you can find anything? Answering such questions helps you define your magus, and is usually fun to boot.

# Multiple Laboratory Activities

Sometimes you may wish to perform laboratory activities that, though rewarding, are well within your capabilities and do not each require an entire season of effort. In this case, you may choose to perform multiple activities within the same season, splitting your time among them all. All the activities you perform in a season must be of the same type (learning spells, instilling powers in an invested device, creating potions) and must use the same Technique and Form. To perform multiple activities, simply add up the levels of all activities performed and apply your Lab Total to the total of the levels.

If you perform arcane experimentation, you add a single simple die + risk modifier to your Lab Total, but any results rolled on the "Extraordinary Results Chart" apply to all activities performed in the season.

# Help in the Lab

Though the Code of Hermes provides protection for magi who meet on neutral grounds, the sanctum of a magus (laboratory and living quarters) is a special place in which magi hold their greatest treasures and deepest secrets. Thus, the Code of Hermes allows for magi to exact any toll on magi who trespass within their sancta. Because one magus foregoes protection of the Code when in the laboratory
