ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

The Size trait might be +4, the Quality +1, and the Repair -2. The sum of these traits is 3. This sum is used to determine the score of the Buildings characteristic (but is not itself the score). This score is purchased using a pyramidal scale the same way that characters' Ability and Art scores are. Looking at the chart provided, a sum of 3 equates to a score of +2. Note that the sum of traits does not always add up the exact number needed to purchase a given characteristic value. Such values should be rounded towards zero when the characteristic value is determined. Thus, if 7 points worth of traits were totaled to determine a characteristic, that characteristic's value would be +3.

This pyramidal purchase scale is used at several other points in covenant creation. When it is mentioned, you can use the chart above to determine the costs of various traits.

|  Season | Plus | Minus  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Spring | +20 | -50  |
|  Summer | +40 | -30  |
|  Autumn | +80 | -20  |
|  Winter | +40 | -50  |

cept, so he starts by selecting the season. Voluntas is a Summer covenant, and so has 40 positive and 30 negative points.

Covenant characteristics and traits may be purchased in two ways. You may purchase the characteristics first, on the pyramid scale, and then split the points in each characteristic between its traits. Alternatively, you may spend the points directly on traits and then total them to determine the values of the characteristics. The first method is recommended for NPC covenants, the second for the troupe's own covenant.

# Covenant Characteristics

## Access

Access governs how easily your covenant can get things that it needs, whether food or more esoteric supplies. It does not deal with how easily other people can get at the covenant—that is covered by Seclusion, below. If your covenant has good access and also good seclusion you will

## Beginning Steps

The first thing you will have to decide is what season your covenant is in when you create it. Once this has been decided, refer to the table above for the number of positive and negative points that you must spend when purchasing the covenant's traits. These values are approximations—not every summer covenant will add up to the totals listed. But since the change between seasons takes place over time, this is as it should be. We recommend that you stick to the values listed when creating your troupe's covenant.

You should give some thought to the background of the covenant before you start spending points. You will create a much more realistic and cohesive place if you have some overarching ideas at this stage.

Example: David decides to work out the details of Voluntas, having written the story of one of its apprentices. He already has a fairly detailed con

|  Cost | Quality of Supplies  |
| --- | --- |
|  -3 | No supplies—the covenant must steal them.  |
|  -1 | Low quality supplies that tend to dry up in bad years.  |
|  0 | Supplies equal to those available to average peasants.  |
|  +1 | Supplies equal to those available to prosperous peasants.  |
|  +3 | Supplies similar to those available minor clergy.  |
|  +6 | Supplies similar to those available to a wealthy merchant.  |
|  +15 | Supplies similar to those available to a landed noble.  |
