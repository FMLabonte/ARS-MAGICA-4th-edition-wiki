CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
37

Fatigue. If you botch, you continue casting spells until you fall unconscious.

Old: You started your apprenticeship late in life, or were held far too long by your master. Your age is 40 + Stamina, or higher if you wish. This means you may have to make rolls on the Aging chart (without the aid of a longevity potion) before play even begins. Your first year as a magus will probably be spent in creating your longevity potion.

Painful Magic: Casting spells causes you to suffer the equivalent of one Body level in pain for each spell you cast. This reduces all your actions by the appropriate wound penalty, which is cumulative with any from actual injuries or fatigue (though you do not suffer any physical damage from pain). You recover these "pain levels" just like Fatigue levels.

Study Requirement: You are unable to study magic (including spells, Arts, and enchanted items) from books or vis alone. You must study in the presence of the appropriate Art. For example, you need to sit next to a brook or pond to study Aquam, or a large fire to study Ignem. Growing things are good for Creo, decaying ones good for Perdo. As your knowledge grows, you need to work with larger and larger quantities. This may limit your ability to learn some Arts. For example, the volcano that you need to learn Ignem 20 may be too dangerous to work near. This is up to the storyguide to decide.

Weak Parma Magica: Your Parma Magica offers no protection under relatively common circumstances which are fairly easy for an opponent to utilize, such as when you are wet or facing away from the caster of the spell. You would be well advised to keep your weakness from being discovered by too many potential enemies.

## -4 Flaws

Chaotic Magic: Your magic is very wild. When you cast a spontaneous spell, you must specify a desired level of effect. If you fall short of or exceed that target by more than five levels, the spell still works, but its effects are beyond your control—the storyguide decides the results. When casting Formulaic spells or using vis, roll twice the normal number of botch dice. You may not Master spells.

Susceptibility to Divine Power: You are especially sensitive to the Dominion and suffer twice the normal penalties (such as spell-casting modifiers and botch rolls) to your magic when in a divine aura.

Susceptibility to Faerie Power: You are especially susceptible to the fey and their magic. Whenever you enter a faerie area, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than its aura rating to avoid becoming disoriented. In addition, your magic resistance score, including Parma Magica, against faerie magic is halved. If someone else uses their Parma Magica to protect you, their resistance is not affected and you benefit normally.

Susceptibility to Infernal Power: You are especially vulnerable to the dark powers. Whenever you enter an area of infernal influence, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than the aura rating or become ill (-1 on all rolls). You get only half your normal Magic Resistance score against infernal magic, though if someone else's Parma Magica is protecting you, it counts normally.

Unpredictable Magic: You must always roll a stress die when casting spells, even if you are completely relaxed. You may not master formulaic spells. Your lab work always requires a roll on the Extraordinary Results chart without the risk modifier (see page 91), though you do not get the experimentation bonus. If you do experiment, roll twice on the chart for each season you spend.

## -6 Flaws

Non-Spontaneity: Your magic is so strongly tied to the formulas and rituals of the Order of Hermes that you cannot cast spontaneous spells.

Personal Magic: Your magic works best on yourself, and your rolls to affect targets at ranges greater than Personal are halved. This penalty also applies to laboratory projects dealing with anything but yourself, including a familiar. Study is not affected.

Unstructured Caster: You have never quite mastered the intricacies of spellcasting, and are unable to perform formulaic magic without extreme effort. You cast all formulaic spells as though they were ritual spells (including the need for vis), and you may not learn ritual spells at all. You cast spontaneous spells normally.

## Companion Social Class

There are very defined strata in the society of Mythic Europe, and you must determine where your companion falls among them. (Magi do not pick a Social Class, since mundane status becomes largely irrelevant once they join the Order of Hermes. Grogs are all considered to be serfs, servants, or other such rabble.) Some Social Classes automatically include other Virtues and Flaws, which do not have an additional cost. Each companion can belong to only one of the following Social Classes.

Each of the Social Classes listed below comes with a Reputation equal in level to the Virtue or Flaw that provides it. The Reputation applies to those who would know of it—use common sense.

Social Class becomes important when dealing with those of a higher or lower social standing. In a situation where your status is important (such as when accusing someone of a crime, or perhaps trying to intimidate someone), the storyguide may decide to modify the chance of success by the difference between your Social Classes (positive or negative). For example, a priest accuses your freeman character of committing some crime. Actual guilt or innocence is irrelevant—all that matters to the magistrate is the status of the accuser and the accused. The freeman tries to defend his innocence, and you make a Bargain roll. The storyguide decides that the priest's +4 Social Class will hinder the success of the roll, and your target number is increased by the difference between Freeman (0) and Priest (+4).

Subject to storyguide approval, the higher Social Classes can also apply to important positions within the Church. Bishops, abbots and other powerful religious officials can be interesting and compelling characters in your saga, if played appropriately.
