CHAPTER III

HERMETIC MAGIC

# Requisites

Most spells involve a simple combination of two Arts, one Form and one Technique. Some spells, however, involve more than two. For instance, a spell that turns a human into a bird uses Muto because you are transforming something, Corpus because you are affecting a human body, and Animál because you are turning the human body into an animal body. In addition to involving the two primary Arts—Corpus and Muto in this case—casting the spell concerns your Animál score as well. This third Art is a requisite.

Requisites, if any, are listed for each formulaic spell in the Spells chapter. (See the spell Curse of Circe on page 125 as an example.) Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have wider knowledge. You must use the lesser of your score in the requisite and your score in the spell's main Technique or Form—Technique if the requisite is a Technique, Form if the requisite is a Form. For example, if you have the scores Animál 6 and Corpus 13, and you cast the Muto Corpus spell Curse of Circe, which has a requisite of Animál, you treat your Corpus score as if it were only 6. Note that if your requisite happened to be higher (for example, if your Animál were 15), you would use the lower basic form (your Corpus of 13 in this case).

Sometimes a spell has a requisite for both its Technique and Form. You must use the lowest in each case. And, if several requisites apply to the same primary Art (for example, if there are two Form requisites), your effective score is the lowest of the group. Furthermore, any Magical Affinities or Deficiencies you have with an Art apply when you use that Art as a requisite.

Requisites listed with a spell's statistics apply when you are learning, inventing, or casting that spell, but do not apply for determining the defender's magic resistance. The defender's magic resistance is determined by the spell's primary Form, not that listed as a requisite, even if the caster's requisite Form score is higher than that of his primary Form score.

# Casting Requisites

Some requisites are not listed along with a spell's statistics because they only apply when the spell is being used in a certain way, not when learning or inventing it. These are called casting requisites. You choose which Arts you use as casting requisites when casting the spell, so what you can affect is limited by your choice. The lowest Technique score and Form score among the primary Arts and all the chosen casting requisites are the ones you use when you cast the spell.

# Spontaneous Requisites

Requisites work the same way for spontaneous spells. When the Arts to be used are determined, determine whether requisites are involved. If so, they limit your Arts just as they do for formulaic spells.

# Targeting

Some spells affect a target directly. While casting Curse of Circe, for example, you must concentrate on the body that you are transforming into a pig. If you successfully cast the spell, it affects the target directly (though it may resist magically).

Other spells conjure some type of medium, such as fire, which in turn affects the target. To have their desired effect, these spells usually need to hit the mark. For instance, if you are trying to blind an enemy with Flash of the Scarlet Flames (page 135) you have to get the flash right in the target's face. These spells require a targeting roll in order for you to place them correctly. Spells that need to be targeted are indicated

# Spell Targeting Table

The basic ease factor for spell targeting is a 3+. Modifiers to this ease factor are listed below. For example, a hustling target at far range requires a 9+ to hit.

|  Description of Target | Ease Factor Modifier  |
| --- | --- |
|  Standing still or moving carefully | 0  |
|  Hustling | +3  |
|  Sprinting | +6  |
|  In plain view | 0  |
|  Obscured (darkness or cover) | +3  |
|  Near range | 0  |
|  Far range | +3  |
|  Sight range | +6  |
|  Large target | – (target's Size)  |
|  Small target | + (absolute value of target's Size)  |
