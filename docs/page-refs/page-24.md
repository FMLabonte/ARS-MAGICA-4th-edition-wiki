## House Mercere

Gifted Mercere Starting Abilities: Magic Theory 3, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 3, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Gifted Mercere Starting Experience Points: 9 + age

Non-Gifted Mercere Starting Abilities: Hermes Lore 3, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4, Survival 1, Weapon Class (choose one) 2

Non-Gifted Mercere Starting Experience Points: 14 + age

As shown above, when generating a member of House Mercere, you must choose whether the character has the Gift or not. Even Mercere without the Gift are recognized as full members of the Order of Hermes.

At the storyguide's option, non-Gifted Mercere may occupy a player's companion slot, allowing that player to play a Gifted magus in addition to the Redcap. In such a case, the Mercere should still be generated according to the rules for magi (though will obviously receive no magical training).

## Required Virtue:

Redcap (+1): You are a messenger of the Order of Hermes. You may be assigned to one covenant or may wander among several, delivering messages. In exchange for your services, you receive a moderate stipend during each visit (typically 4 silver pennies), a few days to rest, and are shown high hospitality. You possess a sigil, and have all the privileges of membership in the Order.

Most common folk do not harass or harm Redcaps for fear of bringing the wrath of the Order down upon them. Even magi think twice before interfering with your mission. This gives you a high degree of protection when you travel, even if you are alone.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Well-Traveled (+1): See page 43.

Jack-of-All-Trades (+2): A life on the road brings many new experiences. See page 43.
