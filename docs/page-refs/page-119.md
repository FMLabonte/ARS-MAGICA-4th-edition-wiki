in the region. The gale-force winds and lashing waves cause immense damage along shorelines. Visibility is reduced to a few paces, missile fire is futile, and travel is nearly suicidal. Weak structures are blown over, and all but most seaworthy ships are certain to flounder unless they can be beached before the storm reaches full intensity. You must be able to see the area where you want to center the spell. The cyclone dissipates at the storyguide's discretion, but lasts for at least a day.

Level 25: Speak with air.

## Intéllego Auram Spells

Level 15

### True Sight of the Air

R: Per/Touch, D: Conc/Moon T: Room

Spell Focus: A Four-Leaf Clover (+1)

Lets you see clearly through all manner of obfuscation in the air nearby, including smoke, fog, and dust, even if the obfuscation is magical. The clover is said to help you see through deceptions and obstructions.

### Whispering Winds

R: Sight, D: Conc/Moon, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Three Leaves from an Oak Tree (+1)

The winds bear their tidings to your ears, allowing you to hear words spoken by any group of people within your line of sight, provided no solid barrier (including glass) intervenes.

## Level 25

### Eyes of the Bat

R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: The Eyes of a Bat (+1)

You can move about confidently in complete darkness by sensing air and its boundaries (for example, where solid objects are). The spell ends when you can see normally, or when, for any reason, you stop using blind navigation.

### Sailor's Foretaste of the Morrow

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Bound

Spell Focus: The Liver of a Pig (+1)

You know precisely what tomorrow's weather will be, and you gain a general impression about the weather for the week ahead.

## Muto Auram Guidelines

The basic range is Near, basic duration is Momentary and basic target is Small. Transforming only one property of air generally lowers the level by one order of magnitude.

Level 4: Double or halve the intensity of a manifestation of air.

Level 5: Transform an amount of air into another form of air.

Level 10: Transform an amount of air into another element. Transform an amount of air into a gas that does +5 damage.

Level 15: Transform an amount of air into a mixture of elements. Transform an amount of air into something slightly unnatural (for example, into silvery fog or a specific shape).

Level 20: Transform an amount of air into something wholly unnatural (for example, transform a cloud into a horse shape that gallops across the sky).

## Muto Auram Spells

### Blasting Wind, Blinding Mist

R: Near/Far, D: Inst, T: Ind

## Level 20

### Clouds of Thunderous Might

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: The Essence of an Air Elemental (+5)

Changes rain clouds into a full-fledged storm. The storm is non-magical, and lasts as long as a normal storm, usually several hours. This spell cannot be used to make an already existing storm more severe.

### Rain of Stones

R: Far/Sight, D: Mom, T: Group

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Hailstone (+1)

Requisites: Terram

Turns rain into stones as it falls on a Group, causing +15 damage. If the spell focus is used, it must be thrown into the air.
