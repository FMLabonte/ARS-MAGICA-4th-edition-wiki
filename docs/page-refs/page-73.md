CHAPTER III

HERMETIC MAGIC

- Parma Magica: This is a ritual that Hermetic magi use to protect themselves. It is usually a magus's Parma Magica Ability score multiplied by five.
- Form Knowledge: Magi who have a score in the Form that is affecting them add their Form score to their total. If you are a master of the Art of Ignem, you are not easily affected by flame spells.

A target's magic resistance covers only the target and anything he wears or holds in his hands. Just touching something does not convey protection on it, and things extended far from the body (such as a fully extended staff) are not covered by magic resistance. The storyguide has the final judgment on what is protected by magic resistance.

Magic resistance is automatic for all creatures that naturally have it, including magi. It is possible, however, to decide not to resist a given spell. By concentrating, you may suppress the bonus provided by your score in an appropriate Form and also drop your Parma Magica. If a Parma Magica is temporarily dropped, it resumes protection when you will it to, and remains until it wears out at the next sunrise or sunset, as usual (see "Parma Magica," below). You do not need to lower your Parma Magica to affect yourself with most spells. Any spell you cast of range Personal automatically circumvents your magic resistance.

# Parma Magica

The use of the Parma Magica is unique to magi of the Order of Hermes, but is not a genuine spell. Rather, it is a ritual that focuses magical energies into a shield around you and others you designate it to protect. It takes about a minute to perform this ritual, and all those who are to be protected must be present.

Once conjured, the Parma Magica adds 5 times your score in the Ability to your magic resistance rolls. The ritual protects you until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. At that time you may perform the ritual again, renewing your protection.

You may protect one other person for each point you have in the Ability, but your score is effectively 3 points lower when you are protecting them. Therefore, in practice, you need a score of four or greater to protect others. For example, if you have Parma Magica at 5 and you are protecting other people (up to five of them), you all receive a 10 point bonus to your Magic Resistance from the Parma Magica. (Your skill of five, minus three because others are being protected, equals 2, which is then multiplied by five.)

Your score in the Form of any attacking spell also applies to the magic resistance of all those under the protec

tion of your Parma Magica. It applies fully and with no penalty. Each individual protected by your parma magica who is in the range of effect of a spell must roll his own magic resistance.

Others protected by your Parma Magica must be within 15 paces of you to gain the bonus to their Magic Resistance. They may move in and out of this 15 pace radius without breaking the spell, as its duration is until the next sunrise or sunset, they just won't benefit if they are more than 15 paces away from you. Remember that those protected by your Parma Magica are only those you designated while performing the ritual. You must perform a whole new ritual if you want to afford magic resistance to anyone not involved in the last one.

# Awareness of Attack

Whenever your magic resistance succeeds in protecting you from intruding magics, your Parma gives you an immediate sense that magics have been repelled. You do not know what type of magic is repulsed, nor its source. If your magic resistance fails to repel the attack, your Parma gives you no indication that a spell has been cast against you, so certain spells may affect you without your knowledge. However, a spell that, say, causes you to burst into flames will likely draw your attention.

# Concentration

It takes concentration to cast a spell. If anything distracts you while you are casting, you must make a Concentration roll to maintain the spell. If you ever fail a Concentration roll while casting or maintaining a spell, the

|  Distraction Table  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Situation | Ease Factor  |
|  Walking | 6+  |
|  Running | 12+  |
|  Dodging | 15+  |
|  Jostled | 9+  |
|  Sudden noise or flash of light | 9+  |
|  Knocked Down | 12+  |
|  Damaged | 15+  |
