Chapter XI
Realms

Magic is the supernatural basis of Ars Magica, but it is not the only power in Mythic Europe. Four realms of power exist: magic, divine, faerie, and infernal. There also exists the mundane, that which is not supernatural. The lines between realms are not drawn simply, with some on one side and others representing a united opposition. Rather, each has some influence over the rest.

Each realm also has its own unique inhabitants, whose natures are attuned to its properties. They can include huge winged serpents, monstrous giants, mischievous faeries, glorious angels, deceptive demons, and elusive shapechangers. As these denizens share their realms' powers, they are often influenced by and at the mercy of other realms when outside their own.

The word realm, when used in Ars Magica, can refer to one of two things. Let the context be your guide in deciding which is which. Realm can refer to the wide variety of manifestations of a given sphere of power. When referring to the realm of the divine, for example, it can be taken to mean all those things, beings, and places which are holy. This is what is meant most often when the world realm is invoked.

the other hand, realm can refer to an actual location that is the essence of that realm. In this case, the realm of the divine would refer to Heaven. The realm of faerie would refer to Arcadia. And so on.

# Realm Power and Domain

The realms exist and interact in various ways. Each has some parts of the world where its powers are strongest. Such areas are said to have an aura, which can be rated in power on a scale from 1 to 10. Most auras rate between 1 and 5, while very intense auras may have a strength of 6 to 9. An aura rating of 10 usually designates a gateway to the realm of its affiliation. The aura rating of a given area usually acts as a modifier on supernatural activities that take place there. Many areas of the world have no realm affiliation, and therefore no aura. These places are mundane.

Within a supernatural area, the aura rating is usually uniform, but occasionally energy is unevenly concentrated, causing variable aura ratings. Sometimes conditions result in the development of regiones, areas of increasingly powerful aura sharing a single physical location (see "Regiones" on page 244).

Two realms may have influence over the same place. When this is the case, only the stronger can hold sway at any one time. A change in the relative strengths of the two realms can cause an area to switch from the influence of one to the other. For example, a village might be built on the site of an ancient faerie mound. Normally, the area has a Dominion aura (because the villagers are followers of the Church). However, at night (when Dominion power wanes) or on the days of ancient pagan holidays the faerie aura becomes more powerful and holds sway. Sometimes only a small area, like the cellar of a tavern, feels the touch of a power different from that of its surroundings.
