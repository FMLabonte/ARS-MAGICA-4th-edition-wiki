ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

maybe the covenant has protected you and your people in the past and now you repay the debt. You are able to move through all social circles, both magical and mundane. Magi therefore value you as a mediator between them and worldly powers. Your skills in combat are also essential to the covenant's defense.

Knight Abilities: Animal Handling, Athletics, Etiquette, Intrigue, Leadership, Noble Lore, Ride, several Weapon Classes (including Brawl, Shield and Weapon, and Longshaft).

## Mendicant

You are a member of the clergy and have taken a vow of poverty, dedicating your life to the common folk. You work with the magi because you know they are, or can be, good people. Furthermore, you don't see any harm in trying to convert the magi to Christianity, or at least ensure that they don't take the Church for granted. The covenant also offers you an opportunity to see the world, and invites you to do things your vows fail to prohibit.

Mendicant Abilities: Chirurgy, Church Lore, Folk Ken, Scribe Greek, Scribe Latin, Scribe Own Language, Speak Greek, Speak Latin, Theology.

## Merchant

You are a seller of wares and may be itinerant, traveling the lands to acquire provisions and necessities for your covenant. Magi often take you on the road with them to deal with mundanes and their petty business tricks. When not abroad you maintain lines of communication with your contacts, customers, and suppliers. If you don't, the magi might terminate your services. Then what would you do for profit?

Merchant Abilities: Area Lore, Awareness, Bargain, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, Guile, Ride, Wagoneering.

## Troubadour

You are a minstrel, an actor-musician-comedian. Though you might have wandered the land at one time, you've since settled at the covenant. The people there appreciate your music and pay you well—be it coin, food or ale—for a song. Even the rather aloof magi seem to enjoy the occasional tune. You can also embellish your repertoire at the covenant. There are plenty of legends to learn there, and you can sometimes take part in their making.

Troubadour Abilities: Carouse, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, Jongleur, Legend Lore, Play Instrument, Sing,

Storytelling, one or more Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

## Turb Captain

You command all the covenant's grogs, and rose from the ranks through your exemplary service. You now spend much of your time in administrative routine, either recording information about your troops or ordering supplies. The magi expect you to assemble a turb for journeys and rely on your expert choice of skilled, dependable grogs. You are at times able to escape the tedium of your position by assigning yourself to traveling parties.

Turb Captain Abilities: Area Lore, Athletics, Awareness, Carouse, Leadership, Ride, Scribe Own Language, several Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

## Grogs

When you design your covenant you will create many grogs in order to flesh out its inhabitants. Some take part in story after story, acquiring quirks as they acquire scars. Other are simply background characters, only becoming more fully developed if they enter a story.

Inexperienced players may see grogs' limited role in the group as a restriction on their roleplaying potential. To avoid this problem, you should think of grogs as the vibrant lower-class characters found in many Shakespearean plays. Their lives are often insignificant compared to those of the major figures, but their actions often reflect upon or even direct the basic themes and plot of the play. Yes, grogs are peripheral characters, but they're still a lot of fun to roleplay, just as Shakespeare's servants and guttersnipes are enjoyable to watch.

The key to successfully portraying grogs is to emphasize the extremes. Just as they work and live hard, they play hard—drinking is a favorite pastime for all medieval folk. They live menial lives, so often complain about their fate. Grogs tend to be the intellectual inferiors of the covenant and thus make excellent foils and straight men.

As with companions, several sample grog vocations are listed here. Like companions, each has a list of suggested Abilities. Remember that they are suggestions only. You can select whatever you want when the time comes to list your Abilities and their scores. In addition to the Abilities that you select, every grog automatically begins with the Abilities Brawl 1, Carouse 1, and Speak Own Language 4. As with companions, you may depart entirely from these vocations and build from the ground up.
