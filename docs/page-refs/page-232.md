ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

century ushered in a time of peace, enlightenment, and the growth and preservation of magical wisdom.

# The First Tribunal

Two magi were most instrumental in the creation of the Order of Hermes. First was Bonisagus, who discovered a way to create a simple magical shield that protected one from spells (now called simply the "Parma Magica"), and began work on a universal theory of magic. The Parma Magica would permit magi to meet with little fear of being attacked, and a universal theory of magic would give them a reason to work together.

The sorceress Trianoma, apprentice to Bonisagus, made good use of the Parma Magica. Its protection permitted her to seek out wizards all across Europe. She was a gifted diplomat, well able to convince her peers of the benefits a unified Order would bring. Wizards would be guaranteed their individual freedom, but the Order provided the means by which peace could be kept among them. A unified theory of magic would allow them to share their discoveries and knowledge. Trianoma encouraged many magi to visit with Bonisagus and share what they knew with him. From Druids, for example, he learned how to create new spells at a moment's notice. This skill developed into spontaneous magic. The rudiments of ritual and formulaic magic grew from the traditions of the Roman cult of Mercury, which worked powerful magic in prolonged rituals involving many participants. Using this and other knowledge, Bonisagus developed a broadly applicable theory of magic, now known as Hermetic theory.

While Bonisagus unified the magic of the magi, Trianoma masterminded their political unification. She had brought twelve magi together who all wanted to form an order. They learned the Parma Magica, studied Bonisagus's theory of magic, wrote the Code, and named their order after the Greek god of magic, whose cult they knew to predate the Roman cult of Mercury. At Durenmar in the Black Forest in A.D. 767, the twelve magi swore to uphold the Code of Hermes, and the Order was formed.

Since these magi could work together and share what they learned, they grew quickly in power. They realized that with the power of magic in their hands, the only other mortals they needed to fear were other magi. Systematically they sought other wizards out and offered them membership in the newly reformed order. All they asked was for the wizards to abide by the simple Code of Hermes and to allow themselves to be adopted into one of the houses that had been formed.

# Houses of Hermes

Members of the Order of Hermes are divided into twelve houses. Each House is a mystical lineage, and each house (with the exception of Ex Miscellanea) can trace its ancestry back to the founding of the Order. Membership in a given house is usually passed from master to apprentice, though some houses offer membership to outsiders who can pass a certain set of criteria. Each House is described in the Character Creation chapter, on pages 21-26. For a great deal of additional information on each house, refer to the Ars Magica supplement Houses of Hermes.

Understanding the twelve houses is fundamental to understanding the Order of Hermes, for each house has its own traditions, organizations, and breed of magus. Although the houses are far from monolithic, they are very important in shaping the prejudices, philosophies, and motivations of their members. After his covenant, a magus's next loyalty is usually to his house.

# Crises in the Order

## The Domination of House Tremere

In the 9th century, House Tremere, through skillful use of certámen and political intrigue, nearly dominated the Order, ruling several tribunals and continually growing in power. Tremere, who was still alive and masterminding the attempt to control the Order, was finally stopped by a group of unidentified magi who broke the minds of his chief lieutenants. No one knows who was responsible for "the Sundering," as this attack is called. After this event, other magi were more watchful of political events and more eager to improve their ability at certámen.

## The Corruption of House Tytalus

Near the end of the 10th century, the prima and several other leaders of House Tytalus were found to be diabolists. They had been engaged in a campaign of corrupting magi of other houses. Amid much fear and accusation, they were tried and executed. This corruption of powerful magi increased the Order's fear of devils and added to the suspicion that had developed among magi. Some mark this event as a precursor to the Schism War.
