CHAPTER VI
COMBAT
163

es (in order, as they occur each round) are Movement, First Missile, Melee, Second Missile, Magic, and Fatigue. Each phase is described in great detail below, but you can use them very casually when excruciating detail is not required.

# 1. Movement

At this stage, the storyguide asks each player to declare what actions his character(s) will attempt to perform for the duration of the round. When asked, each combatant declares both his intended action and any movement involved. Any character who intends to fight during the round must declare which opponent(s) he is attempting to engage, at what range he intends to engage them, and what weapon(s) he intends to use. Engagement with certain opponents may be impossible due to range or intervening barriers. The storyguide should use common sense in advising players when they declare an impossible or absurd engagement.

After declarations are all made, each combatant rolls a stress die + Initiative score, using the Initiative score appropriate to the weapon he declared. Other modifiers, found on the Initiative Modifiers Table, can modify this total. The result is an Initiative Total. Storyguides should feel free to impose additional modifiers as seem appropriate to a specific situation.

If everything that's been declared is compatible, each action occurs. If some declarations are exclusive (for example, two characters want to occupy the same position, or one character is attempting to engage an unwilling opponent) resolve each character's movement in order from highest to lowest Initiative Total. Higher totals prevail over lower totals.

The most common form of movement in combat is hustling: moving as speedily as possible while keeping your feet and avoiding stray flailings. You can move up to 15 +

# Initiative Modifiers Table

|  Action | Modifier to Initiative Total  |
| --- | --- |
|  Character on horseback | + Ride skill and high ground  |
|  Character routing | +6*  |
|  Character charging | +3**  |
|  Character holding high ground | +3  |

* A character who declares that he is routing (that is, running away from combat at full speed) cannot make an attack and may not defend against any incoming attacks for the duration of the round.

** A character who is charging must have sufficient room for a running start, adjudicated by the storyguide. This modifier can also applied to mounted characters who are charging, in addition to the modifier they get from simply being on horseback.

Quickness paces per round while hustling; less on broken ground or in the dark. Walking cautiously moves you 9 + Quickness + Encumbrance paces per round. An all-out sprint covers a total number of paces equal to 30 + Quickness + Athletics + Enc, including Wound and Fatigue penalties. The storyguide may require sprinting characters to make an Athletics roll to avoid falling or injuring themselves, especially when sprinting on uneven terrain.

Characters who are simply moving—not engaging other characters or being engaged by them—are free to travel up to the maximum range of the declared mode of movement, as long as they don't travel inside the Effective Space (as defined by weapon) of a character who is engaged in combat. Characters who intend to move and then engage in

|  Hustling | 15 + Qik + Enc  |
|  Sprinting | 30 + Qik + Athletics + Enc – Wound – Fatigue  |
|  Horseback (safe gallop) | 50 + Ride  |
