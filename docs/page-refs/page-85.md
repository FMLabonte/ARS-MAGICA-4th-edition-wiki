gem and staff for a bonus (for example, any spell in the gem that uses a Form bonus for the staff [maybe Herbam]) is permanently lost if the two are separated.

An item that has been prepared for enchantment is useless for any magical purpose until it is attuned as a talisman, or instilled with magical powers.

## Talismans

Talismans help you concentrate and extend your magical powers. A talisman is a very personal item that contains magics and materials that tie it intimately to you and that can be used as a channel for your magical power.

To create a talisman, you must first choose the item's physical form and prepare the item for enchantment as described above. Once you have prepared the item for enchantment, you must simply spend one season attuning the item's mystical energies to your own. At the end of this season, you have a talisman that may be used to aid your magic.

Talismans have several powers. First, your talisman is an extension of your touch as long as you're in contact with it. When you cast a spell of Touch range, you may reach your target by touching him with your talisman. Thus, if your talisman is a staff, your reach is increased by the length of the staff. Second, you always have an arcane connection to your talisman, making it easy to find if it is lost (but also making it a hazard if it falls into enemy hands). Third, your talisman is fully protected by your Magic Resistance if you are touching any part of it. Thus, while an outstretched staff can extend outside the radius of your usual Magic Resistance, it is still fully protected. Finally, even when you're not touching your talisman, it receives the Magic Resistance offered by your Form scores.

In addition to the basic powers of a Talisman, you may also, at any time, spend a season to open your talisman to one kind of magic attunement, based on the shape and material of the talisman. Use the "Form and Effect Bonuses Table" to determine what attunements are possible. Your talisman may be able to accept more than one kind of attunement, and can hold more than one attunement, but you can only invest one new attunement per season. For instance, a magus can enhance his staff talisman by spending a season to attune it to spells that control things at a distance. He then gets a +4 bonus on rolls with spells that control things at a distance (because that is the bonus listed on the Form and Effect Bonuses Table). He could further enhance it to give him a +3 to project bolts and missiles (for example), but that would take another season.

Bonuses from attunements only apply when the magus is touching the talisman. They do not apply to Magic Resistance or any laboratory activities. There's no limit to the number of attunements a talisman can have at one time, though remember that you can only add one per season. There's no roll involved in giving your talisman an attunement bonus; you must simply spend the time to get the bonus.

You can only have one talisman at a time; one must be completely destroyed before you can make another, and you cannot make a talisman for someone else.

You can instill effects into a talisman (see "Invested Devices," below), and because the talisman has already been set up to have an intimate connection to your magic ability, you receive a +2 bonus to your Lab Total to invest it with effects. You can also turn an item already invested with magical powers into your talisman. Whether you invest an item with effects or whether it already has magic powers, an item only needs to be prepared for enchantment once. When that has been done, you simply need to spend the season to make it your talisman.

Note that a talisman is different from a spell focus. A talisman is personalized to a magus and can give a bonus to many of his spells. A spell focus, on the other hand, is specific to a given spell (see those listed in the Spells chapter). You can, if you wish, make a spell focus into your talisman—it retains all the benefits of both.

## Invested Devices

Once an item has been prepared for enchantment, you may spend time and magical resources to bestow magical powers upon it. When you do so, you create an invested device.

The number of Vim vis points spent during preparation of your invested device (outlined under "Preparation for Enchantment," above) sets a limit on the magical effects that can now be enchanted into the device. Each effect you bestow on the device requires a number of pawns of raw vis. The total number of pawns spent to bestow effects on the device cannot exceed the number of pawns spent to prepare the device in the first place.

## Designing the Effect

First, choose an effect to be invested in your device and determine its level. An effect is like a spell, and must be fully defined, as a spell is. You may base the effect on a spell from the Spells chapter, or may invent your own effect. If inventing a new effect, you must design the effect carefully, as if
