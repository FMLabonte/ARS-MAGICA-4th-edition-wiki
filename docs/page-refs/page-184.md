THE ART OF MAGIC

# Bad Effects

Blatant Gift: From now on the magus's supernatural quality is stronger and always close to the surface. This is represented by the Flaw Blatant Gift (page 35). If the magus already has this Flaw, roll for a different bad effect. A magus with the Gentle Gift loses that Virtue, but does not gain the Flaw.

Deficiency: The magus suffers a minor Magic Deficiency (see page 35) with one Art that is opposed to his specialty. An existing minor Magic Deficiency in that Art becomes a major Magic Deficiency (page 35). If there is already a major Magic Deficiency in that Art, the magus gets one in another Art.

Clumsy Magic: The magus gains the Clumsy Magic Flaw (page 36). If it is already possessed, roll for a different bad effect.

Mental defect: The surge of magic has warped the character's mind. A Mental Flaw, such as Obsession or Fear, might be exaggerated or a quirk might worsen into a full-blown Flaw. Assign a defect related to the circumstances of the Twilight, or give the character an age-related mental affliction, as described in "Aging and Afflictions" (page 181).

Physical defect: The power of magic coursing through the character's body has permanently injured it. This might be represented by a Decrepitude point, a physical affliction (see "Aging," page 180), or a disfigurement, as appropriate to the situation.

Automatic magic: Vis oozes uncontrollably out of the magus, whose very presence causes small magical effects of some type appropriate to the character's specialty or to the Twilight itself. These effects are limited in strength and distance and can never be directed by will. They may come and go or vary greatly in power from day to day.

Special: This can be anything that suits the character's unique magical bent or the circumstances of Twilight.

# Story and Character Considerations for Twilight

Wizard's Twilight is a highly variable and personal event for every magus, and as such can add much to a story or character. You should feel free to alter the effects that the dice indicate, or make up your own effects when it is appropriate. The more effort both storyguide and player put into describing a given Twilight episode, the more it can fit the story and character involved. Set

# An Example of Wizard's Twilight

Erat Caecus faces a demon. Grabbing a handful of raw vis in the form of magical powder, he forgoes finesse and lets fly with a spontaneous Perdo Vim spell. The player rolls a 0, and since the powder contained seven points of raw vis, he must make eight botch rolls. Two of them come up 0, and the storyguide calls for a Twilight roll.

The roll is 1 and the reroll 9, yielding 18 + 8 (his previous Twilight total) = 28. As this total is over 24, Erat Caecus goes into Twilight. His player rolls for Twilight points, getting 2, for a new total of 10. The storyguide decides that the magus has accidentally made a supernatural connection with the demon, something few minds can survive without damage. Both fall to the ground, writhing, spitting, and screaming.

The storyguide rules that the longer it takes the other characters to kill the demon, the more intense the Twilight becomes, so he does not allow a roll for Twilight control yet. Dispatching the helpless demon takes long enough that the storyguide adds +1 to his Twilight intensity roll, to be made against Erat Caecus's control roll.

Some of the other characters try to aid the fallen magus, though he shows no response. One, a favored grog, tries talking to him, and the storyguide decides this can affect the magus's control of the experience (a very bad roll can hinder it, and a very good one can help). The grog's player makes a Communication roll and adds +3 for the strong friendship, but the total is still only 7—no effect.

Erat Caecus's player rolls 8 + 3 (Intelligence) = 11 for control, while the storyguide rolls 6 + 3 (Magic Aura rating) + 1 (demon's contact) = 10 for intensity. Since his roll was the higher, the player may roll for a good effect. A die roll is made to determine the result of the Twilight. The die comes up 4: experience points in an Affinity. The player and storyguide talk over the result.

It would be logical to give Erat Caecus experience with his Perdo Affinity, since he was attempting a destructive spell, but that does not take into account the unique contact with the demon. An Affinity with destroying demons makes sense, but overlaps with the existing Perdo Affinity. The storyguide finally lets the player decide between a +2 bonus for destroying demons (in addition to the Perdo Affinity) and experience in Occult Lore. The player decides that Erat Caecus would have spent more time focused on his destructive abilities than on the demon's nature, so picks the demon-slaying bonus.
