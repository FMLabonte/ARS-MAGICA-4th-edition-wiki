THE ART OF MAGIC

# Enchanting the Familiar

Once you and the familiar accept each other, you take the animal to your laboratory and begin a year-long series of enchantments. Any serious distractions from these enchantments ruins them and forces you to start over from the beginning. Enchanting a familiar is different from other enchantments. The bond between you and your familiar causes changes to you both, and you do not have full control over how the enchantment affects you. Your troupe and storyguide determine how you are affected throughout the enchantment, though you do have control over the changes your familiar undergoes.

# The First Season

## Opening the Enchantment

The first season of the year-long enchantment is spent attuning the animal's magic to your own. It requires a number of pawns of Vim vis equal to (12 + the creature's size). You also need to have an Animal score of 10 or better to perfect this harmonization.

During this season, the animal often undergoes physical changes, such as a change in hue, shape of limbs, or texture of skin. It also learns rudimentary speech that you, at least, can understand. It may develop a speech trait to match one of yours, and it may acquire Personality Traits that match yours.

Similarly, you may take on some habits and minor physical and mental characteristics of the animal. For example, a magus with a crow familiar might wipe his face on his shoulder in emulation of the bird's feather-preening. You may wish to take a positive score in a Personality Trait that matches the type of animal you are enchanting (for example, "Raven +2").

# The Second Season

## Strength of the Bond

In the second season the bond is secured. At this time you calculate your bond score, which is equal to your Animal + Mentem + Intellego – the animal's Magic Resistance and Size. You may also add any applicable affinities you have. Your bond score is the total used to purchase cord scores, which are discussed in the following section. It is also used to purchase bond qualities (which are similar in concept to Virtues and Flaws) between magus and familiar, which manifest during the third season of the bonding process.

## Forging the Three Cords

Part of the second season's bonding involves forging three mystic cords that connect you and the familiar. A golden cord connects your magical abilities, a silver cord connects your minds, and a bronze cord connects your bodies. These cords may be seen by someone with the Second Sight Virtue, but they are otherwise imperceptible.

The strength of each of these cords is rated from 0 to +3. To determine all the cords' ratings, divide the points of your bond score among them however you choose and then use the points allocated to each to buy cord scores. A cord strength of 0 costs nothing, a strength of +1 requires 5 points, a score of +2 requires 15 points, and a score of +3 requires 30 points. The total cost of the cords you buy cannot exceed your bond score.

Each cord has a varying effect (described below) depending on how well it is forged. Regardless of the strength, however, effects apply only when the familiar is within 100 paces of you. On the positive side, these benefits also apply to the familiar.

**The Golden Cord**: The familiar helps you avoid magical errors, letting you roll fewer botch rolls when using magic. Your golden cord score is the number subtracted from the number of botch rolls you would normally make (though you must always roll at least one).

**The Silver Cord**: You can apply your silver cord score as a bonus to all rolls that involve Personality Traits, to natural resistance rolls against mental magic, and to rolls to protect you from a natural mental influence like intimidation or verbal trickery. In addition, if your mind is ever overcome by another force your familiar may be able to free you. To be successful, it must roll 9+ on a stress die with the silver cord score as its bonus (one attempt per day). If the roll botches, the animal's mind is overcome along with yours.

**The Bronze Cord**: You can apply your bronze cord score as a bonus to Soak rolls, to healing rolls, and to rolls to withstand deprivation (such as to holding your breath or resisting sleepiness). It does not help you withstand Fatigue.
