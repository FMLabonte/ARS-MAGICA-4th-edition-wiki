THE ART OF MAGIC

# Botch Suggestions

Attract unwanted attention: The attention of someone or something, perhaps the target of your spell, is drawn to you.

Caster addled: You are rendered insane, confused, or demented. You acquire the Flaw Simple-Minded for an indefinite duration.

Caster overwhelmed: You are overwhelmed by your own magic. Make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or be knocked unconscious.

Connection with target: Your target becomes aware of your investigations, and may learn something about you through the arcane link that is temporarily established.

Debilitating: The spell pushes the target too hard and does permanent damage: for example, a Rego Animál spell might forever leave a beast without its natural instincts and urges.

Flawed creation: A creation is heavily flawed, though the flaw may not be obvious until the creation is expected to serve the function it was created for.

Incomplete or improper effect: For example, a spell intended to transform you into a wolf might only transform your head and hands.

Out of control: The spell creates or calls forth something beyond the caster's ability to control.

Related but unwanted effect: For example, a spell intended to transform you into a wolf might turn you into another animal.

Reverse effect: The spell does exactly the opposite of what is intended.

Roll for Twilight: Roll to avoid Wizard's Twilight. If you avoid it, you still suffer another botch result.

Spell affects caster: You, instead of the intended target, are affected.

Too powerful: The spell does more than it should and thereby causes problems.

Undying spell: You cannot stop the spell by concentrating; it does not end at the normal time, and it proves resistant to being dispelled.

Wrong target: Pick a new one at random.

spell automatically fails (though you must still roll to determine if you botch the spell, and you receive one extra botch die if you do). If your Concentration roll ever botches, you automatically lose a Fatigue level.

The ease factor when making a Concentration roll is dependent upon the type of distraction. The type of die rolled is always a stress die, and it is modified by the caster's Concentration and Intelligence. Sample ease factors are listed on the Distraction Table. When more than one situation applies, use the largest ease factor.

# Dangers

Despite the Order's attempts to regulate it and make it a science, magic remains an art. No matter how skilled a practitioner you are, and no matter what precautions you take (short of not using magic at all), your magic will sometimes get out of your control. From the danger of casting a spell improperly to the danger of the enigmatic Wizard's Twilight, magic is filled with hazards.

# Botches

The most common danger you face when performing magic is a botch. The results of a given spell cast under stress are not entirely predictable, and a botch on a spell roll

means that you've made a mistake that, rather than just causing your spell to fail, causes your spell to produce different effects than you intended. Though the effects of botches can vary widely, they are almost universally detrimental. The storyguide should use his imagination when determining botches. A table of suggestions is provided. In general, single botches are embarrassing or inconvenient, double botches are dangerous, and triple botches are potentially deadly. Effects may be tailored to the Technique and Form that were being used, or may be more unpredictable.

# Wizard's Twilight

When your magic gets beyond your control, or you are overwhelmed by the powerful magic of another, you can succumb to what is known as Wizard's Twilight. Wizard's Twilight is a state where magic alters your very being, perhaps improving your knowledge of the arcane, perhaps deforming you physically. With each bout of Twilight, you approach Final Twilight, when you succumb to magic for the final time and pass completely out of the physical world. Wizard's Twilight is discussed fully in the Storyguide chapter, on page 182.
