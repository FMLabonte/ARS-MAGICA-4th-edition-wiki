CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
35

Student of Faerie: You have been trained in the various rites and observances of faerie magic. You receive a +3 modifier to rolls involving Faerie Lore, and are considered to have the Common Sense Virtue (see page 41) when dealing with faeries.

Subtle Magic: You may cast spells without using gestures at no penalty. You gain no benefits from using normal gestures.

+3 Virtues

Enduring Magic: The effects of your spells tend to last longer than usual (though Instant and Permanent spells remain just that). The storyguide secretly rolls a simple die; the number rolled is a multiple to the spell's normal duration.

Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic: You can do more with spontaneous magic than most magi at the cost of your own life energy. When you decide to exert yourself in casting a spontaneous spell, you declare the level of effect you wish to produce before rolling. Make your casting roll as normal, adding all the appropriate modifiers and dividing by two. If your result is higher than the level you declared, you spend only one Fatigue Level as usual. If your result is less than the level you declared, you must expend one Body level per five points (or fraction thereof) you missed the target level by. The spell then succeeds as normal, provided that you are still conscious. Running out of Body levels has the normal effect—it is quite possible to kill yourself if you botch badly or attempt to cast very high level spells.

+5 Virtues

Elementalist: You were trained in the Elementalist tradition, which has been adopted into Hermetic Theory but has never truly been absorbed. As such, you are very proficient in working with any of the natural elements of air, earth, fire, and water. You automatically gain Affinity with Elements (see page 34), which applies to all rolls involving Auram, Aquam, Ignem, and Terram. Due to your exotic training, however, your ties to Hermetic magic are weak. You have a Major Magic Deficiency in the Form of Vim (see page 35), and all rolls to cast formulaic spells that don't deal with the elements are at a penalty equal to your Affinity with Elements score. Furthermore, you are unable to cast any ritual spells, save those that specifically and concretely involve elements. This Virtue prevents you from having any other Magical Affinities.

Silent Magic: You may cast spells without speaking, at no penalty. You do not benefit from using your normal voice.

Variable Flaws

Cyclic Magic (negative): As with the variable Hermetic Virtue, your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature and is less potent at specific times. This Flaw yields two points for each -3 penalty to spell-casting rolls at the peak of the cycle. The length of time during which you are at a disadvantage must be equal to the time when there is no penalty.

Deleterious Circumstances: Your magic is restricted in certain situations. Total the cost for the commonality of the occurrence with the crippling effect it produces to determine the cost of this Flaw. You may take this flaw more than once.

Situation:

Common (-1): This effect takes place in relatively common circumstances. Examples include when in village of more than 200, when touching the ground, or during daylight.

Uncommon (0): The effect harms you in uncommon circumstances. Examples include when casting on wild animals or when sitting.

Restriction:

Minor (-1): Your magic rolls (spellcasting rolls and Lab Totals) are at -3 when in the situation.

Major (-2): Your magic totals (spellcasting rolls and Lab Totals) are halved when in the situation.

Total (-3): Your magic does not work at all when this condition is in effect.

Magical Deficiency: You have trouble casting a particular type of magic. Total the cost for the Art you have problems with and the penalty you receive to find the total cost of this Flaw.

Art:

Uncommon Form (0): Any Form save Corpus or Vim

Common Form (-1): Corpus or Vim

Technique (-2): Any Technique

Effect:

Minor (-1): The level of the Art is divided in half when used for any purpose other than studying that Art.

Major (-2): Any total that includes that Art (spellcasting rolls and Lab Totals, for example) is halved.

Poor Formulaic Magic: You are simply not very good at formulaic magic. Subtract the chosen cost of this Flaw from every roll that you make to cast formulaic spells.

-1 Flaws

Blatant Gift: People immediately realize that there is something strange about you, even if they do not know you are a magus. Animals are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by your presence. You suffer a -6 penalty on all interaction rolls with normal people and animals.

Creative Block: You have problems creating new things in the lab. You receive -3 on Lab Totals when you invent new spells, craft magic items, and make potions, unless you are working from a lab text. If you experiment, rolls twice as many dice on the experimentation table.

Disjointed Magic: You cannot use previous knowledge to help you with magic. You gain no benefit from knowing a spell that is similar to one you are learning or inventing, and you gain no enchantment bonuses from Techniques and Forms already invested in an item.

Flawed Parma Magica: Your Parma Magica (a ritual of protection against spells) is defective and provides only half the normal magic resistance against a certain Form. You may purchase this Flaw more than once for different Forms.

Follower of Verditius (Verditius only): See page 26.

Hedge Wizard: Because of your esoteric magic, other magi distrust you, and more importantly, grant you no respect. You start with a negative Reputation within the Order of Hermes at level 3 as a hedge wizard, even though you are a member of the Order.

Incompatible Arts: For some reason you are completely unable to use one or more combinations of Techniques and Forms (except for Vim and Corpus). This Flaw may be taken repeatedly with different combinations, but may not be combined with a Deficiency (see page 35).
