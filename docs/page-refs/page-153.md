# Obliteration of the Metallic Barrier

R: Reach/Near, D: Mom, T: Spec
Spell Focus: A Handful of Rust (+1)

Shatters a barrier of metal or stone up to one foot thick. Those within one pace of the barrier, on the opposite side from you, take +10 Damage. Alchemically refined and magical metals may be able to withstand this spell.

## Stone to Falling Dust

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind
Spell Focus: 100-Year-Old Dust (+3)

One solid non-living, non-metal object weighing up to 500 pounds turns to a pile of dust. A casting requisite may be required, of the Form appropriate to the target.

# Level 40

## Cascade of Rocks

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual

Makes a cliff collapse, causing an avalanche. The effects depend on the size of the cliff and what lies below it.

# Rego Terram Guidelines

The guidelines for controlling dirt, sand, mud, or clay are listed below. To control stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To control metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude. Manipulating objects with great precision may also be higher, depending on the level of precision.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small.

Level 5: Control or move dirt.
Level 10: Deflect a single attack by a metal weapon.
Level 15: Teleport dirt up to 15 paces. Deflect several attacks from metal weapons.
Level 20: Deflect all metal weapon attacks against you that you are aware of.
Level 25: Keep metal objects completely away from your person (that is, deflect all attacks against you from metal weapons, whether you are aware of them or not).

# Rego Terram Spells

## General

## Ward Against Faeries of the Mountain

R: Spec, D: Ring/Perm, T: Circle
Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

As Ward Against Faeries of the Waters (ReAq Gen), but for faeries of earth and stone. At some angles at night, the ring may be seen as a dark brown dome.

# Level 5

## Unseen Arm

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Small
Spell Focus: A Shaving of Silver (+1)

Slowly moves a light, nonliving thing, like a mug, instrument, or small pouch of coins; it cannot oppose intentional resistance. Magi use this spell to manipulate things at a distance, but the spell cannot be used to pull something from a person's hand or to move something that is held. The silver spell focus must have come from a valued serving platter. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for target are required.

# Level 10

## Trackless Step

R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind
Spell Focus: Hoof-Shaving from a Deer (+3)

You leave no tracks in the earth until you come to a stop, such as to rest or fight.

## Wielding the Invisible Sling

R: Far, D: Mom, T: Small
Aimed: +2
Spell Focus: A Sling (+3)

Hurls any nearby object that could normally be thrown by a person at any target within 100 paces. The object must not be held down or otherwise restrained. Damage depends on the object thrown, up to +5 for a fist-sized stone. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for target are required.

## The Unseen Porter

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind
Spell Focus: A Silver Shaving (+1)

Like Unseen Arm (ReTe 5), but it can carry large objects such as crates. Roughly speaking, it has the capabilities of a very strong person (Str +5). The heavier the object is, the slower the unseen porter moves. If delicacy is required, high Finesse stress rolls (12+ or so) are needed. The spell can only carry inanimate objects, and cannot carry you. It also cannot lift things more than 6 feet above the ground. The focus must be from a valued serving platter. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for target are required.

# Level 15

## The Earth's Carbuncle

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec
Aimed: +1
Spell Focus: A Small Stalactite (+3)
Requisite: Muto
