## Muto Corpus Spells

### Level 5

#### Evil Eye

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Oversized Eyeball (+3)

Enlarges an eye of the target, deforming the face and producing a grisly image.

#### Eyes of the Cat

R: Touch, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Hair from a Cat (+3)

Requisites: Animál

The target gains the eyes of a cat, which allow him or her to see in near darkness (but not in absolute darkness, such as a lightless subterranean cavern).

### Level 15

#### Disguise of the New Visage

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Chip from a Pooka's Hoof (+5)

The target's facial features are transformed to any approximately human configuration you choose.

In Cralian of Tremere's version of this spell, the new visage is always as unassuming as possible.

### Level 20

#### Arm of the Infant

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Lock of Hair from a Baby (+1)

Shrinks a person's arm to half its original length and makes it pudgy, like an infant's.

#### Preternatural Growth and Shrinking

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Giant's Heart (+5)

Adds +1 to your normal Size or decreases it by up to 2 points. An extra Size point bestowed by this spell gives +1 Soak, +1 Strength, an extra Body level, and -1 Defense. Each point lost has the reverse effects.

### Level 25

#### Gift of the Bear's Fortitude

R: Personal/Touch, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Heart of a Black Faerie Bear (+3)

Requisite: Animál

Your flesh becomes resistant to physical damage. You get +10 to your Soak. If the duration is "Year" and you suffer a Soak botch, your resistance comes back after the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. Your flesh is tough and insensitive; any rolls that involve a sensitive touch (such as for picking a lock) are at -3.

#### Shape of the Woodland Prowler

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Wolf's Tooth (+3)

Requisite: Animál

You place a wolf skin over yourself or another, and the target changes into a wolf. The target may change back at will, ending the spell. Before casting this spell, you must first, of course, acquire the skin of a wolf.

### Level 30

#### Cloak of Black Feathers

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Cape of Black Feathers (+0)

Requisites: Animál, Auram

You hang a small cape of raven feathers on your back (or on someone else's, if you use vis) and the target transforms into a raven. The target can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell.

### Level 35

#### Curse of Circe

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Mandrake (+3)

Requisite: Animál

Turns a person into a pig. Mandrake, which is also known as "Circe's Plant," can be found in faerie forests and at places where a human life has been taken. The target may resist this affect by making a Stamina stress roll of 9+.

#### Stance of the Patient Tree

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Tree Branch (+3)

Requisite: Herbam
