# Mortals and Faeries

If one truth may be applied to all faeriekind, it is that they are universally repulsed by the divine. Faeries cannot bear the presence of the Dominion and may go into hiding where it holds sway, or move on to more secluded domains. As mortals carry their beliefs with them, they unwittingly drive faeries before them like dust before a storm.

However, even if mortals range into and make their homes in faerie lands, the power of the fay is not always diminished. Mundanes can be so cautious of the faeries' wrath, or so thoroughly frightened by the clergy's warnings, that they dare not set foot in dark woods or virgin mountains.

Faerie power can also endure the presence of humans if tolerant relations are established between the two folk. Commoners and lowly faeries may even exchange goods or services; though to humans the trade may not seem equitable, it may be perfectly reasonable to the faerie mind.

Inciting the wrath of faeries is to be avoided at all costs. Being completely wild, they adhere to no human or divine standard of morality. There's no evident rhyme or reason to the pain and torture they can inflict, and being eternal, they can hold grudges beyond mortal reckoning. Because faeries are so unpredictable, all relations with them are fraught with peril. Magi too would be wise to keep the peace with faeries, for not even Hermetic magic is a reliable defense. Being magical themselves, faeries are highly resilient to spells.

# The Seelie and Unseelie Courts

Faeries that are amenable to dealings with humanity are usually from the Seelie Court. These faeries are of mostly human appearance, but are more noble, regal, and beautiful to human eyes. The Seelie are also incomparable masters of song and music. While members of the Seelie court are the most sociable of faeriekind, their powers are so alien that human life can seem irrelevant and annoying to them.

The Unseelie Court is made up of dark, malicious faeries who often delight in tormenting humans. Generally, these faeries are more brutal and less refined than their Seelie cousins, and can be so vicious that their mere approach is a threat. Their homes are dark pools and silent groves that the wise know to avoid at all times. There are Unseelie castles that can only be seen at dusk, where powerful faerie lords reign; those who visit cannot pass through the gates again.

# Marlossi, Lady of Light

Marlossi is a high elf of the Seelie Court. At first she seems human, and the only thing that truly sets her apart is the sense of peace and welcome one feels when looking upon her gentle visage. (Those protected by Parmae Magicae do not feel this effect.) She wears a light green gown and simple jewelry. She never leaves the safety of her home, which is in a small faerie wood. She is most often found in the boisterous company of animal-like faeries, and she relies on them to protect her from physical threats.

**Adventure Seed:** The characters are found trespassing on Marlossi's land, but she graciously accepts them as guests. It becomes apparent, however, that she expects them to perform a dangerous task for her; to wit, recapturing an area she once ruled, now controlled by the Unseelie Court. The faeries have been fighting for untold years over the land, but neither side can triumph, for the rules dictate that no wounds count unless at least one mortal is on each side.

**Body levels:** OK, -1, -3, -5, Incapacitated

**Powers:**

**Disappear, CrCo 20, 3 points:** If grievously threatened, she can suddenly disappear, transporting herself to some safer place. If someone is holding her or she is bound by iron she cannot disappear.

**Heal, CrCo 20, 3 points:** Marlossi can permanently heal those she touches, chasing away pain and fear as well. Each use of this power allows for the recovery of a lost Body level. Certain magical or especially grievous wounds might not be healed by this power. After a person receives Marlossi's healing, all Bravery Personality Trait rolls made in the following day receive a +1 modifier.

**Vis:** If struck, she bleeds a white liquid worth 4 pawns of Creo vis.

# Hybacus, the Feral Musician

Hybacus is a satyr (having a human body with goat legs and horns) whose greatest joy is to play his panpipes while
