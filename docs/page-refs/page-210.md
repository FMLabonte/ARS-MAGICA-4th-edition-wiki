ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

25 grogs. 1 negative point removes the same number, so that a covenant with one magus and no servants has nine negative points. You need not pay for PC magi or companions (but cannot sell their space back, either). An average covenant is about the same size as a medium monastery, or a fairly large village. About five hundred inhabitants makes the covenant the size of a small town, while 2,000 makes it a significant urban center. The largest cities in western Europe at this time had around 50,000 inhabitants—in England there were only two with populations above 15,000.

Example: Voluntas only has five magi, but otherwise has the average number of inhabitants. David spends one negative point here.

Overall, having spent one negative and one positive point, Voluntas has a score of 0 in improvement.

# Library

## Spells

An average covenant has 1500 levels of spells written up. 1 positive point increases that by 300, 1 negative reduces it by the same amount. In nearly all covenants, this includes at least one copy of Aegis of the Hearth.

Example: Voluntas has a lot of points left, so David decides to make the library good. He spends eight positive points on the spells, so that the library has a total of 3900 levels of spells. He decides that the players can make up the content of the spell books to a great extent, because he doesn't want all that work.

## Hermetic Books

An average covenant has 450 points of books. 1 positive point increases that by 90, 1 negative reduces it by the same amount. Libri quaestionum cost target + Quality, summae cost twice the sum of Quality and level, and tractatus cost triple Quality. A medieval library of 200 books is large. More than a thousand approaches legendary, and is likely to be exaggerated by several factors of ten when people talk about it. Most covenants will have large libraries.

Example: David decides to spend 10 points, for a total of 1,350 points. Again, it will take some time to design the exact contents of the library.

## Mundane Books

An average covenant has 300 points of books. Each point increases or decreases this by 60. Multiply the targets of mundane books by three when working out their cost (but otherwise, use the formulae above), since it is harder to raise Knowledges than Arts.

Example: Mundane books are likely to be less important, so David only spends five points here, for a total of 600 points. This is still going to be a very impressive mundane library.

Overall, Voluntas has spent 23 positive points on its library, for a final score of +6. This library will make a good bargaining tool, and is likely to provoke some jealousy.
