Exceptional Abilities may never be used or even attempted by characters who do not have the appropriate Ability. All Exceptional Abilities are listed below, and page references are given so that you can locate their descriptions easily.

Speak (Language): Fluency in a particular language. Rather than a die roll modifier, your score in this Knowledge measures your ability to communicate.

|  Score | Fluency  |
| --- | --- |
|  1 | ...Basic ideas  |
|  3 | ...Haltingly functional  |
|  5 | ...Fluent  |
|  7 | ...Perfect clarity and understanding  |

When two people speak to each other, the lower Ability score determines how well they communicate. Characters who speak related languages can communicate at a penalty to their scores (assigned by the storyguide) depending on how closely related the two languages are. Speak Latin (and Greek and Hebrew) cannot be chosen with this Knowledge—it is a separate Academic Knowledge. Specialties: specific dialects, expansive vocabulary, specific technical vocabulary, slang. (Intelligence)

# Magical Training

Magi spend 15 years in apprenticeship learning the theory and practice of Hermetic magic. This includes the use of the fifteen magical Arts and many formulaic spells. During this step, you will purchase a rating in each Art and will choose a list of formulaic spells your character knows.
