# Wizard's Twilight

For magi, death is not certain, so perhaps they have some right to call others "mortals" as though they themselves were not. While all others on the Earth are pursued by death, magi also face Wizard's Twilight. Many magi, especially those who attempt magic too powerful or unpredictable for them to fully control, are overcome by the vis

Magi usually go through a number of Twilights in their lifetime, each of which might last minutes or days. Though some magi manage to remain conscious as uncontrolled magic courses through them, and even have limited control of their bodies, most fall unconscious or enter spasms and fits, or both. Roleplaying a Twilight episode is a unique opportunity to explore the character's nature within the context of the story.

Surviving Twilight can give magi new insights into their Arts, but it can also leave physical deformities and mental aberrations. As the years pass, they become more vulnerable to final Twilight, leaving the worldly realm through a "back door." Though the body may hang on for hours or even days, the magus passes beyond the scope of human knowledge and wisdom, and is no longer human as we understand the term.

Hermetic theory generally holds that magi who have passed into final Twilight are not "dead" in the usual sense. They cannot be summoned as ghosts, and no Hermetic magic can contact them. In fact, the ghosts of dead magi can still enter Twilight through being summoned or controlled. For this reason, it is a very rare feat to summon the shade of a magus departed centuries earlier.

## Twilight Points

Magi accumulate Twilight points which, like Decrepitude, cannot be removed by any known means. Any magus who has a total of 24 Twilight points passes into final Twilight and departs from this realm, in spirit if not in form. There are various ways to gain Twilight points, but going through temporary Twilight (see below) tends to have the greatest effect.

- Longevity potions: Once magi begin to rely on magic to extend their lives, it begins to hold sway over them. In the first year of taking a longevity potion, a magus gains one Twilight point, with another gained every 20 years thereafter.
- Studying Vim: Each time a magus's score in this Art increases to a multiple of 5, one Twilight point accrues.
- Spell botches: The storyguide can assign Twilight points for these or other dramatic, magical effects in the course of a story. Generally, one Twilight point and an appropriate side effect are plenty.
