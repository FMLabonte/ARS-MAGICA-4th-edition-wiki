# Stores

## Vis stocks

An average covenant has 100 pawns of vis in stock. Every positive point increases this by 50. Every negative point decreases it by 50. Negative amounts of vis indicate a vis debt. In general, the covenant has 25 years to pay this off—the troupe should work out the details. Vis stocks are separate from vis supplies, and may be of any Art or combination of Arts.

**Example:** David decides that he needs to get rid of some negative points, and this is as good a place as any to do it. He decides that Voluntas has no vis on hand, for two negative points.

## Supplies

An average covenant has no mundane supplies stored up (like cash or other unused things) beyond the annual stock of food. 1 point buys 500 pounds of silver worth, while 1 negative point buys a similar amount of debt. This is separate from income.

500 pounds of silver is a lot of money, equivalent to about 600 cubic meters of wheat. That's enough to feed a peasant family for 200 years, or about 5000 sheep, or 1500 oxen. Alternatively, it would buy about 500 average books, 20 normal, timber-framed houses, or a parish church with a tower.

**Example:** It seems unreasonable that Voluntas would have large stocks of mundane things. On the contrary, Julia's projects are likely to eat up funds beyond those immediately available, and so a debt makes sense. The lack of any really spectacular structures suggests that these debts are likely to be modest, so he only spends one negative point here, for a total debt of 500 pounds of silver.

## Reputation

An average covenant has no net reputation. Good reputations are bought with positive points, bad reputations with negatives. Buying a reputation costs a number of pyramid points equal to the level of the reputation. Thus, a level 3 good reputation would cost 6 positive points, while a level 4 bad reputation would cost 10 negative. Reputations for covenants work the same way that the do for characters (see page 191). The storyguide may wish to modify the costs slightly depending on the power and influence of the affected party.

**Example:** None of Voluntas's magi seem the sort to get along well with others. Julia is too pushy, and Phessalia and Desiderius are positively unpleasant. David thinks about their likely activities, and decides to take two negative reputations. The first applies to the other covenants in the tribunal at level 2, for being prone to commit to impossible causes. The second applies to the local peasants at level 1, as dangerous wizards. He takes the 3 negative points for the former and 1 negative point for the latter, for a total of 4.

Overall, then, David has spent seven negative points on Voluntas's Stores, so it has a score of $-3$ in this characteristic.

# Relations

## Allies

Allies are described in two aspects: the power of the ally and amount of time and resources they spend on your behalf. 1 point of power is a landed knight, merchant, parish priest, Spring covenant, or Winter covenant. 3 points is a minor noble, city alderman, dean or prior, or a weak covenant. 5 points of power is a moderate noble, king's officer, minor bishop or abbot, or a moderate covenant. 7 points is a powerful noble, high officer of the realm (like a Chancellor), major bishop or abbot, or a powerful covenant. 9 points is a king, archbishop, or domus magna.

Each point you spend on time represents $5\%$ of your ally's time and resources, or two weeks per year. This is very rough, and should just provide an order of magnitude. No matter how many points you spend, the King of England will not spend every waking hour assisting the covenant.

You can spend negative points for an ally's enemies. You get one quarter the number of points that they cost the ally. The enemies will be after the covenant to some extent, but have no major grudge with the covenant.

**Example:** Voluntas clearly has no Hermetic allies at the beginning of the introduction, since Julia has to do a lot of work to create them. David wonders about mundane or other magical allies, but decides against it. No points here, then.

## Enemies

Enemies follow the same guidelines as allies, but cost as many negative points as allies cost positive.
