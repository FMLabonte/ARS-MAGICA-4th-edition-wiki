ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

The covenant council have given my mistress the money for the land, and so we are going to London. Jocelin is coming along as well, because he knows London better than we do. My mistress has been sketching new plans all day, wondering whether she needs to buy a larger plot of land. Jocelin says that we should have some time to look around the city while she negotiates with people.

Twenty third day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.

We have arrived at London. There are so many people and houses here, and they are so big. Not as big as Rievaulx, on the whole, but large all the same, and so many of them. We are staying in an inn that Jocelin knows. We have private rooms, in return for a lot of money and a promise from Jocelin that he will perform. I don't think that I have ever actually heard him sing.

Twenty fourth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.

My mistress gave me leave to wander London today. Jocelin took me around for an hour or so, showing me how to get to the inn from St. Paul's, and where I could buy food. Then he left me. I think I lost my purse less than half an hour after that, but it is no matter. The merchants balance the thieves, and I can make as many silver pennies as I need. I watched a miracle play, which showed the martyrdom of St. Catherine, and wandered round St. Paul's, listening to people conduct business until they realized I was eavesdropping.

Then I wandered up among the merchant houses, and met Elisabeth. She is working as a servant for one of the big houses, and was happy to go with me to an inn. I bought her wine, rather than the cheaper ale, and made sure that we were away before sunset. It's amazing what a tiny amount of magic can achieve. Perdo Mentem made her forget the time and the greetings from her friends, Creo Mentem enhanced her liking for me, and Creo Corpus made her burn with lust. Magic, and a bit of timing. The sun set while we were in flagrante delicto, so she barely noticed the magic wear off. She did hurry home as soon as we had finished, though, and I got back to the inn to discover that I had missed Jocelin's performance. Ah well.

Twenty sixth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.

Elisabeth had a young man, it seems. Quite a wealthy one, with a large number of rough friends. They sent a messenger, claiming to be from her, and like a fool I followed him. They were all waiting for me, and I couldn't affect

enough of them. I don't know if they would have killed me, but Jocelin arrived, with the household guards of some noble, and they fled. He has promised not to tell my mistress, and hopes that I have learnt a lesson.

I certainly have. I must get my mistress to teach me more Intéllego.

First day of Cancer, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.

The negotiations are complete, and my mistress holds the deeds to a large plot of land just outside the city. She has spent most of today expounding her plans for the Great Chamber, both as a masterpiece of architecture and art and as a place where all the magi of the Tribunal can meet away from the influence of Blackthorn. Apparently Semitae has also agreed to support this idea. We shall leave London tomorrow, and I still haven't heard Jocelin sing.

Tenth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.

My mistress talked to representatives of many covenants at last year's Tribunal, and now we are traveling about the country to negotiate support for the Great Chamber. She plans to form a religious order to look after it while the magi are not using it, thus giving it legitimacy while preserving our control. Personally, I doubt that many magi will want to meet in the Dominion, but she plans to portray that as a benefit: it grants additional safety to those attending Tribunal.

We have come to the covenant Schola Pythagoranis in Cambridge. They are well-disposed to us, as House Jerbiton dominates them, but they are more interested in scholarship than art, and I think that our visit is somewhat ill-timed. They have taken advantage of the dissolution of the university at Oxford to lure the Masters and scholars here, and the town is bursting at the seams. It is strange to be in a town, and all the churches be closed. Even the round church of the Holy Sepulcher is closed, although I thought that the Templars had an exemption from the interdict. Jocelin is nervous about his immortal soul, but I told him not to worry: the faithful are not damned merely by dying during an interdict.

We are being accommodated in one of the covenant's houses for tonight: they have buildings scattered through the town. The sancta of all the magi are in a large stone house near St. Sepulcher's, but the grogs and covenfolk live in other buildings, sometimes in single rented rooms. At least this covenant will not have any problem about meet-
