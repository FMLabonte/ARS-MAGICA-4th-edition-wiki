THE ART OF MAGIC

# The British Isles

nouncements notwithstanding, 1220 finds Hibernia a land of no clear lord or borders. Irish kings still rule the wilds, and the authority of the King of England extends little beyond the tips of his knights' lances.

# Hibernia

At the western edge of the known world lies the island of Hibernia, also known as Ireland or (in the native Gaelic language) Éire. It is a green land, blessed with mild winters and ample rain, covered with deep forests and bogs.

Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales, 1146-1223) has written two books about Ireland, based on his travels there. He observes that on the fringes of the world, Nature tolerates fantastic things, and Ireland is surely a land rich with magic and wonders. Gerald reports fish with gold teeth, creatures part animal and part human, and stranger things. He also relates wonders of the saints, of which Hibernia has no lack.

A Breton princess of the 12th century said she'd rather marry any French vassal, however humble, than be queen of Scotland.

A mix of people inhabit Scotland: waves of invaders and settlers, from ancient Picts to Celts from Hibernia, to Germanic migrants and Viking raiders. More recently Norman and Flemish knights have come to serve the Scottish kings. In the Highlands and the outer isles the predominant tongue is Gaelic, and the people are known as savage and proud (and oft rumored to be pagan). Along the coasts and in the lowlands, Anglo-Saxon dialects are more common.

The king of Scots is Alexander II. He has continued the efforts of his predecessors to make Scotland a feudal monarchy, though the highland clans are most resistant to this project. In the lowlands, many of the lairds who owe
