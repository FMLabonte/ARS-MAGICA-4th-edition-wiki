ARs MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

attempting a feat that demands your extra attention, or if you have just failed an action and are trying again, the Storyguide can call for a Concentration roll before you can make the attempt. This Ability is especially important for magi because it helps them maintain concentration on spells despite distractions. Specialties: spell concentration, reading, lab work. (Stamina, Intelligence)

Folk Ken: Understanding the background, personality, and motives of another person. Often the storyguide secretly rolls a die when this Ability is used. Thus, you do not know if your character guessed correctly, or even botched. Specialties: peasants, townsfolk, nobles, clergy, magi, the opposite sex. (Intelligence, Perception)

Guile: Telling convincing lies, as well as feigning emotion, belief, or frame of mind. If you understand the person you are attempting to deceive (roll 9+ on Perception + Folk Ken), you may gain a bonus to your Guile roll. Specialties: lying to authority, fast talk, elaborate lies. (Communication, Perception)

# Skills

Skills are trained or self-taught Abilities. You can increase them through instruction or direct experience.

## ACADEMIC SKILLS

Academic Skills require formal training and cannot be learned without a skilled teacher. If you have not acquired an appropriate background through the purchase of a Virtue, you can acquire these skills only by finding a willing teacher through role-play.

Disputatio: Disputatio is the skill of participating in formal debate. In the medieval period this is used as a teaching technique as well as a technique of debate. A disputation is a formal event. One person proposes a thesis, and gives one or more arguments in its favor. Another person rebuts those arguments, and proposes arguments against the thesis. The first person responds, and the process continues until either a decision is reached or everyone gets bored. Disputatio is only useful in a formal situation, and its use will only impress the educated. It is quite useful as a one-on-one teaching method. Specialties: debate, teaching. (Communication)

Lectio: Lectio is the skill of teaching from a text—reading the text aloud and commenting on it, either to clarify or to extend the meaning. This skill only covers oral presentation—written presentation is covered by the Scribe skill. It is used primarily for teaching a group of students. Specialties: specific types of texts. (Communication)

Scribe (Language): The Scribe skill covers the basic ability to read and write, and also the ability to compose a letter, charter, or book. In Western Europe, the Roman alphabet is used for most languages. Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic script are used in other areas. Scribe skill must be purchased separately for each language or alphabet you wish to be proficient in. Specialties: copying, illumination, original composition. (Intelligence)

## COMBAT SKILLS

Combat Skills are separated into different Weapon Classes. You take a separate skill for each Weapon Class you wish to use. If your character is a combatant, it is highly recommended that you take combat skill in the class "Brawl," as this includes the ability to dodge blows. Also, you should note that each Weapon Class is a separate discipline—knowing Shield and Weapon (for example) does not help you use Single Weapon at all, and vice versa. Because of this, you may want to purchase scores in multiple weapon classes, just in case you're caught without your primary choice.

Each Weapon Class is described below. Each class has specialties including the specific types of weapons it covers. For example, Single Weapon would include the specialties shortsword, longsword, mace, and others.

Brawling: Brawling covers fist fighting, using knives and daggers, and improvising weapons. It also covers the ability to dodge incoming blows.

Single Weapon: Using clubs, maces, shortswords, and other one-handed weapons.

Shield and Weapon: The use of a single weapon (as described above) and a shield of any type.

Two Weapons: The skill of using two single weapons, one in each hand. This includes Florentine style, double ax, and many other combinations.

Great Weapon: Covers greatswords, claymores, some poleaxes, and other weapons requiring the use of two hands.

Chain Weapon: Using morning stars, flails, and other flexible weapons.

Longshaft Weapon: These are spears, lances, and polearms which have long shafts and the killing point on one end.

Thrown Weapon: Includes slings, rocks, axes, daggers, and other objects hurled at an opponent.

Bows: Training in the use of recurved bows, self bows, long bows, and other non-mechanically stringed bowshafts.
