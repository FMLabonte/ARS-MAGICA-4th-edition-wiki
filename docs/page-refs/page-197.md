CHAPTER VIII
SAGA
197

the vilest of deeds through evil characters, and the players will never blame you for their ill fortune.

# Rewards

Whether the object of a quest or the spoils of a dangerous encounter, rewards are visible proof of the characters' success. Some things, such as books and spells, are valuable only to magi, while others, such as jewelry or magical devices, can compensate companions and grogs for putting their lives on the line. Finding the right balance for your saga is important to your players' satisfaction. Give the characters enough to keep the saga moving, but exercise moderation so that they will keep wanting more.

# Raw Vis

Raw vis is universally valuable. Magi apply it to a variety of uses and other characters can trade it or have their possessions imbued with it. Raw vis is often found within the bodies of supernatural beings, and sometimes can be harvested from magical plants or other renewable sources. When awarding vis, decide upon the physical characteristics of the source, the Art to which it is attuned, and the number of vis points in it.

Since the availability of raw vis largely determines how rapidly magi grow in power, a saga with too little or too much may have severe problems. The covenant should start with enough raw vis to satisfy basic needs: an average of three to five points per magus per story is about right, depending on how often adventures take place in the progression of years. You can increase or decrease this as you see fit, but remember that too much vis can destroy a saga by making magi ultra-powerful.

# Treasure

Covenants and characters need money in order to survive and fund projects. Mundane treasure can be one source. Since acquiring money is often of secondary importance to magi, though, it is advisable to concentrate on a treasure's beauty: hoards of gleaming gold; jewelry boxes inlaid with gems; scintillating necklaces; thick bracelets of precious metals; and perhaps even a royal crown. Impress the characters so that they will covet their find instead of rushing to the nearest jeweler for quick cash.

# Tomes

Magical and scholarly tomes can help a literate character learn Knowledges, spells, Arts, and the techniques for creating magical items. Tomes are therefore extremely valuable, and prized by magi over nearly anything else. Books are very rare; play up their mystery and romance. Make them something to be desired, an item of far greater significance to a magus than the mightiest enchanted sword.

See pages 188-190 for more information on the types of books that exist and how they will aid the magi of your covenant in their learning.

# Magical Artifacts

During their expeditions, magi often find mystical devices. Some are constructed by fellow magi, others created by dwarfs, gnomes, elves, demons, faeries or other mystical beings. In legends, magical items are things of great beauty—awe-inspiring to say the least. They are powerful objects, not crackerjack gadgets. Peppering your saga with miscellaneous items cheapens the grandeur of these awesome creations. One way to avoid this is to award predominantly one-use items like potions and powders. Another is to strictly limit the number of truly powerful artifacts. Make the characters work hard to earn such things.

A good deal of entertainment can be had from a character's attempts to learn how an artifact works. Some have obvious powers, such as a cape that makes the wearer invisible. Others are more obscure, and discovering their abilities requires intense research in the laboratory. An effective combination involves some that are obvious and others that are hidden. Investing humble-looking items with fantastic power can be the basis for exciting stories. After all, the Holy Grail itself was not that magnificent in appearance. See page 90 for information about investigating enchantments on items.

The inset describes some example artifacts, ranging from the fairly simple to the awesomely powerful. You can use these as models for magic items in your saga. Each item description is followed by a number in parentheses, which indicates the target number for investigating its properties in the laboratory.

# The Big Finish

Eventually, the saga will come to an end. With any luck, it is one that you planned for and one where the covenant members achieve their goals.
