CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

ing in the Dominion. I wonder how they manage their research.

Twelfth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.

We met with Edward of Milton, the Warden of the covenant, today. Of course, I merely sat and listened, but my mistress did allow me to stay this time. He had taken our request to the covenant council, and they had considered it carefully. As expected, they were sympathetic, but they had a request for us. The magi here do find that the Dominion interferes with their work, but they have identified a magical area in a nearby forest. Unfortunately, most of the forest is under the control of the faerie, and all attempts to construct laboratories have been thwarted. He wants us to negotiate a peace with the fay. If we succeed, he will support my mistress's plan at the next Tribunal. She agreed, of course. She looked worried on the way back here: I suspect that she was trying to figure out how to deal with the fay. I suggested that we should go and get Phessallia, but she merely stared at me. I suspect that Phessallia is not fully behind her project.

Fifteenth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.

We will enter the faerie forest tomorrow. I shall leave this journal here, with a note instructing the covenant to retain it if I do not return.

Eighteenth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.

I have returned, and we were successful. This event deserves a more detailed account, however. The forest is only an hour's travel from Cambridge, and so we left shortly before dawn, my mistress preferring to deal with the faeries of the light. We arrived there a while after the sun had risen, and walked into the forest. My mistress was calling out that we wanted to speak with the ruler of this place, and the grogs were looking around nervously. I, of course, maintained my poise and dignity, as did Jocelin. He said that the fay were well known to be fond of minstrels, so he felt safe.

After we had wandered for an hour, Guy, our woodsman, announced that we were lost, and that he could no longer make sense of the vegetation. My mistress was pleased at the news because, she said, it showed that we had entered the faerie forest. I felt a burning by my side, and realized that my knife was glowing with red heat. I plucked it from the sheath and threw it to the ground, where it melted and ran away like water. All around me, the grogs were doing the same. Poor Stephen was wearing chain mail, and

we could not get it off him in time. As we stood there, completely unarmed, Jocelin said, quietly, "I seem to remember that faeries dislike iron." My mistress turned on him, and seemed about to do something serious, but after a moment she relaxed.

"Yes, I should have thought. My apologies, lord." I was confused for a moment, until I followed her gaze, and saw that the faeries had arrived. Their lord was dressed in gleaming silver armor like the scales of a fish, and sat on a throne of ice, which sparkled in the sun. Beside him stood his guards, great bears in a silver livery, carrying clubs the size of young trees. At the lord's feet sat his minstrel, a tiny creature with enormously long, spindly fingers, which cradled a lute. I sensed other eyes on us, but I could see nothing.

"Why have you sought me out?" the lord asked. My mistress replied.

"We are here on behalf of the magi of Schola Pythagoranis. They seek permission to build a laboratory on the edge of your wood."

"Why should I permit that?" My mistress was silent, and Jocelin stepped forward, clearing his throat.

"Would you accept a wager for your permission?" The faerie lord considered him, and nodded.

"Perhaps. What wager, and what contest?"

"A singing contest, between me and your minstrel. If I win, you will allow the magi of Schola Pythagoranis to build and use laboratories in that area of your woods, for as long as they wish. If he wins, they will give up any attempt to build there."

"And you will remain here as my servant, until you die."

"Agreed." He said it quickly, before any of us could intervene. My mistress was pale, and went to talk to him, but he waved her away, turning his attention to tuning his lute. He looked at me over the frets and winked, and I realized that I was finally going to hear him sing.

He struck a chord, and began. It was an old lay, the tale of a faerie maiden who enslaved human knights with her beauty, and kept them imprisoned in a cave. He sang well, and the faerie minstrel joined in. Its fingers moved like lightning over the strings, and it seemed to be playing three parts at once. It opened its mouth to sing, and three voices spilled out, the high voice of a young boy, the deep voice of a mature man, and a voice that was like the singing of birds in the dawn. My heart sank, but Jocelin only smiled, as he played a little interlude between verses. The maiden's latest victim was led into the cave, and there met the previous
