ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

years (or fraction thereof) of your current age to create the potion. A magus can reinvent his potion at a later time to take advantage of increases in his Art scores, but this requires investing another season of research and the appropriate vis for the new potion.

Normally, only Creo, Corpus, and Vim vis may be used in a longevity potion. However, a longevity potion is a very personal creation, and as such, it is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. You may, with the approval of the troupe or storyguide, substitute any type of vis that your magical talents are strongly associated with.

A longevity potion's effect lasts until you actually suffer the ill effects of aging; that is, you develop an affliction, have the score of an existing affliction increase, or gain a Decrepitude point through aging (see "Aging" on page 180). After this, the potion loses its effectiveness and a new potion must be brewed. You can invent a new potion (following the normal rules for doing so), or brew a new batch from the old formula. This involves simply making a new investment of vis (of an amount based on your current age) but no significant investment in time. This "replacement" potion may be created using your lab text (see next section) from the previous brewing. If your longevity potion fails and you make aging rolls before you create a new one, you suffer the full effects of your age. You do not gain back any affliction points or Decrepitude points that you suffered when you were not under the effects of a potion when you do finally take one.

When creating a longevity potion for the first time, you can increase its potency by adding extra vis to the brew. This vis is above and beyond that which you must spend for your current age. For each additional pawn you add to the brew, add 1 to your Lab Total. This vis is invested when you originally create a given version of a potion, but you must use the same amount of vis with each new potion of this formula that you make when the previous one fails. If you reinvent the potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, you can choose not to use extra vis. Extra vis spent does not increase your Lab Total to determine if you can create a longevity potion in the first place.

You can make longevity potions for others, even for non-magi. To determine the ingredients for another person's potion, you and that character must spend one season of research and brewing. Your Lab Total (based on Intellego Corpus), plus aura, must equal 30+. Otherwise, you cannot determine what ingredients need to go into the potion. If your score is 30+, you can make the potion and must invest one pawn of vis per five years of the character's current age. A longevity potion made for another magus functions just as if made for you (-1 to aging rolls for every 5 points of Lab Total). Non-magical people, however, are not as resilient as magi. The potion you create for a mundane therefore only subtracts one from the character's aging rolls for every 10 full points in your Lab Total.

# Laboratory Texts

When you instill a power into an enchanted item or create a batch of potions, your work is not forgotten as soon as the enchantment is complete. You create a laboratory text to record your work, and you can use the lab text to help you recreate your work. Lab texts can record the enchantment of devices, the brewing of potions, and the creation of longevity potions. Because of the inflexible, complex nature of enchantments, however, a lab text is not as useful as a spell written out in full. While a written spell aids you in learning a spell and maybe creating other spells with similar effects, a lab text only allows you to duplicate the results of a previous laboratory enterprise.

You should keep a record of your magus's life in the laboratory, so you know what sorts of lab texts you have access to. You must record your Magic Theory score at the time the lab work was done, all the information about the types and amounts of vis used in creating the potion or device, the effects you created or modified, and all game modifiers involved in each step of the creation process. Your magus is assumed to have created lab texts every time he did work in the lab.

In general, a lab text provides a bonus equal to your score in Magic Theory on any further projects you attempt that are of the same type and that produce the same effect as the original. This Magic Theory bonus is equal to your Magic Theory score at the writing of the lab text, not your score when the text is referred to again. If the enchantment recorded in the text is within your Magic Theory specialty, add 1 to the score of the lab text.

If you have a lab text describing how to instill an effect into an item, you get a flat bonus to your Lab Total when instilling that same effect into the same type of item (that is, of the same category on "Form and Effect Bonuses Table"). If you have a lab text describing how to create a batch of potions, you get a bonus to your Lab Total when creating a batch of potions with the same powers. Lab texts that detail longevity potions also give a bonus to the magus's Lab Total, making more recent potions more potent and more helpful to resisting aging. However, a lab text for longevity potions is only useful when recreating a previous batch of potions, though it is still valid if you have to add more vis to the new potion based on your increased age. If you're creating a new
