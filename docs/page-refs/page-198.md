# Exempli Gratia: Magic Items

## Ring of Lifekeeping

Upon donning this ring the wearer automatically loses four Body levels. If the character is already wounded, donning the ring can kill. The only way to recover is through bed rest (see the Wound Recovery Chart, page 178, to determine recovery time). If the ring is removed during this recovery time, it causes no more damage. It causes no harm if put on again, but does not bestow its powers upon the wearer. If the wearer keeps the ring on throughout the recovery period, the ring's powers are revealed when he is next endangered. The ring absorbs the first Body level of damage that the wearer would normally suffer on any one day. The wearer may "lay hands" on another and heal up to one Body level, although this is counted against the daily limit the ring can heal the wearer.

This ring was taken from the finger of the martyred Saint Lemar of Bologna. The ring possesses the saint's divine power and continues to spread his healing ways. The ring's divine origins explain why those of Infernal background, or even those with the flaw Tainted With Evil, cannot touch the ring without automatically suffering 2 Body levels of damage. The ring's powers do not function for such folk. Furthermore, the item's powers are beyond the investigative detection of magi. (n/a)

## Salve of the Stone's Strength

When rubbed over one's naked body (a character may wear clothes once it is on), this salve grants strength and resistance to damage. Add +3 to the effective Strength and +6 to the Soak of the wearer, until the next full moon. One drawback is that the wearer sinks like a stone in water. The dwarves who made the salve don't know this, but the characters may learn later by accident. After the salve wears off, the user is insatiably hungry and drops three Fatigue levels. This salve was created by some dwarves in the Alps for occasional trade with magi and other mortals. (20)

## Shield of the Red Lion

This wooden shield has a red lion's face painted on it and was crafted by faeries. The lion is alive, but only interacts with those who impress it. If a character behaves bravely while using the shield, the lion speaks to the character later, during a more quiet time, preferably when others are not around. It says, in words only the chosen character can hear, "Greetings, valiant warrior. I am Andriste, and I am your loyal companion. Call on me and I will put forth a roar to put fear in the hearts of others. Call on me and I will watch over you while you sleep. Call on me one time, and one time only, and I will step out of this shield, and we will fight your enemies side by side. I am Andriste. Call on me in your need." From that point on the character (only) can see the lion's eyes move, but Andriste does not talk any more. No one else can befriend the lion until it rejects the current bearer of the shield.

The bearer of the shield gets +3 on all Brave Personality Trait rolls after having spoken with the lion. Once per day he can call on Andriste to roar, and all who hear it who are not on the chosen warrior's side must make a Brave roll of 6+ or become afraid. At night the character can ask Andriste to keep watch. It roars if it detects a danger to its owner (it has an Awareness score of 10). This roar is separate from the roar that causes fear. The owner may also call Andriste out of the shield, in which case the lion fights to the death alongside the shield's bearer. When killed or the enemy defeated, the lion bids its companion farewell and departs forever, leaving the character with only a blank shield with which to remember his ally. The lion never returns to the shield, no matter who holds it.

## ANDRISTE

**Characteristics:** Int 0, Per +2, Pre +3, Com 0, Str +6, Stm +5, Dex +2, Qik +4

**Magic Might:** 22

**Size:** +1

|  Weapon/Attack | Init | Atk | Dfn | Dam  |

|  Bite/Claw | +7 | +9 | +5 | +18  |

**Soak:** +15

**Body levels:** OK, 0/0, -1, -3, -5, Incapacitated

If the owner of the shield ever acts cowardly while using the shield, the eyes no longer appear to move, the lion never again responds to the character, and the +3 Brave bonus is lost. At this point another bearer of the shield can befriend Andriste.

A magus who rolls 25+ while investigating the shield in the lab makes contact with Andriste, who explains something of himself, but not necessarily all. More than anything, he's upset by having been disturbed by someone who is not a warrior. (25)
