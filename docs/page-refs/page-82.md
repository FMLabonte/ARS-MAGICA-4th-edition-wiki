ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Once you have determined the specifics of the spell you are trying to invent, you must determine if you can actually invent it. Then, you must figure out how long it will take. You can only invent a spell if your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level. You get a bonus for knowing a similar or variant spell (+1 per five levels of similar spell—see "Similar Spells" on page 69), and you may also add your aura rating as a bonus to your Lab Total. Any requisites that the new spell has also count in figuring your Lab Total. For each point that your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level, you accumulate one point per season. When you accumulate points equal to the level of the spell, you invent it.

## Copying Spells

All magi have grimoires containing their spells. These spells are not immediately useful to others, however, as they include all sorts of personal abbreviations and shortcuts that others cannot understand. (Remember that everything is written by hand in the Middle Ages.) In addition, some magi sprinkle their magic texts with bits of misdirection, which they can recognize and ignore themselves but which endanger others who take these parts of the text as genuine.

If you would like to copy a spell of yours so others can read and learn it, you can spend a season writing up to (Scribe Latin x 20) levels of spells to make them usable by others. Also, in one season, you can copy (Scribe Latin x 60) levels of spells that are already written understandably.

## Translating Spells

If you want to translate the spells of another magus whose secrets and abbreviations you do not know, you must first roll to "break the code." For most magi's texts, the "code" is merely the author's personal style, so you only need to make an simple Intelligence + Scribe Latin roll of 6+ in order to learn the spell. If the author intentionally obscured the work, add the author's Intelligence to the ease factor of your roll, or raise it even higher if the information is actually in code. If you have broken a given magus' code in the past, you get a +3 modifier to decode other spells.

Once you have broken the author's code, you can determine the nature of the written spell. Upon breaking the author's code, you automatically determine the Technique and Form of the spell (as long as it is a Hermetic spell). To find out what the spell's level is, and what its effects are, you must roll a stress die + Lab Total and exceed the spell's level (which is known by the storyguide). Once you know the spell's Technique, Form, level, and effects, you can write a copy of the spell that may be read and used by others.

You get one roll to decode and one roll to translate a spell per season. If both rolls succeed, the process takes the length of a season. If either roll fails, the translation attempt fails and the season is wasted; the spell remains untranslated (although you may automatically try the second roll again in another season if you've already succeeded in the decoding roll). If you botch your translation roll, not only do you lose the season but something horrible happens. The copy of the spell may be ruined, or maybe you accidentally trigger only a part of the spell that adversely affects you or others.

You may spend a season to obscure up to (Scribe Latin x 20) levels of your own spells. There is rarely any benefit to obscuring a spell unless the spell is created as a trap or you have to share your library and want to keep your spells to yourself. To create a spell that's a trap, you must invent the spell as you do any other.

You may occasionally acquire a non-Hermetic spell, and wish to identify it. Non-Hermetic spells can be identified in a manner similar to that for Hermetic spells, but with much more difficulty. Even determining the Technique and Form may prove impossible without prolonged study. The actions required to identify any non-Hermetic spells are up to the storyguide.

## Vis Extraction

You can extract raw vis from a magical environment (that is, any area with a magical aura) by focusing the magical energy into a physical form. For each season that you spend extracting vis from the environment, sum your Creo + Vim + Magic Theory + (3 x Aura). For every full ten points in the result, one point of Vim vis is produced.

## Magical Enchantments

Physical creations, as surely as magical knowledge, can increase your power as a magus. In addition to talismans, which you can use to concentrate your magical powers, you can create invested devices, which mimic the powers of spells; potions, which affect those who use them; and longevity potions, which extend your mortal life. Since magical enchantments are unique creations that follow the logic of individual magi, determining how to use one that someone else has created can be a lengthy and even dangerous process.
