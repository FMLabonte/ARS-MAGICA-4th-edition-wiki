MYTHIC EUROPE

# Lay Clergy

For some, to be a lay cleric is the first step on the road to God. For others, it is a refuge from an inhospitable world, without the strict discipline of religious life. The vast majority of students, of whom more is said later, are lay clergy and hence beyond the reach of civil law. Most lay clergy are happy to stay as they are, free to live in the temporal world and subject only to the gentler laws of God. The worst of them are corrupt, licentious, and irreligious, caring only for the freedom their status gives them.

Lay clerics include the following, described in ascending order of seniority.

- Doorkeepers: The lowest order, they guard the entrances to holy places.
- Readers: These clergy write and teach, joining the everyday world with that of the Church.
- Exorcists: Such people are specialists in casting out of demons and in holy cures.
- Acolytes: Closest to holy orders, these clergy minister at the altar.

# Cathars

The hypocrisy of many in the Church invites heresy. One of the most influential heresies in 1220 lays claim to the holiness of monastic life, but renounces the sloth and corruption so often found in the holy orders. These Cathars, or Albigenses (named for the town of Albi, where they flourished), believe that any peasant can be as holy as an abbot or cardinal simply by living in the hermit's fashion, away from the sins of the world. The holy men and women who have given up worldly cares are called perfecti. They rail against pope and monk alike, denounce the sacred rituals of Mother Church, and even invested their own bishops and clergy.

The Cathars threaten the very foundations of the social order, yet their true faith and their charges of corruption cannot be denied. From their sanctuaries, like the inaccessible mountaintop castle of Montségur, powerful orators sway the populace; in some places they practically rule the countryside. For decades there has been debate within the Church as to whether they should be brought back into the holy fold by gentle and reasoned persuasion or burned as tools of the Devil.

The latter course of action has been chosen. The pope sanctioned a Crusade, led by Simon de Montfort, which continues to ravage the once rich land and culture of southern France. One bishop epitomized the crusaders' virulence by declaring that they should simply kill all the inhabitants of a town, orthodox and heretic alike; in the judgement after death, God would know his own.

# The Commoners' Lot

The common people live many different types of lives, ranging from that of the wealthy spice merchant, reclining in a comfortable city house, to that of the poor villein, starving in a tiny hut. The only thing they share is their station, neither noble nor of the Church.

# Serfs

The first peasants to become serfs gave control of their lives and their land to a warrior, striking a bargain to exchange their labor for safety. In the evil days after the fall of Rome, Vikings, howling barbarians, and ravenous hordes from fallen cities roamed most of Europe, destroying all they met. Those who accepted serfdom saved their land and their lives by their bargain.
