ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

You have a number of decisions to make as you design your saga. Keeping the following elements in mind can help you create an epic worthy of your talents.

## Name

Sometime before the saga begins you need to give it a name that sets the tone for everything else that follows. The saga's name should suggest its theme and potential, without giving away any of its secrets. Many are simply named after their covenants, such as the Mistridge Saga.

## Setting

In order to create an engaging saga, you need a world that the players can believe in. One of your first decisions should be to choose some specific locale. If you are going to play in Mythic Europe, northern Iberia or southern France are good choices. There is ongoing conflict between the Christians and the Moors, troubadours are inventing the modern ideals of love, heresy is widespread, and the forbidding Pyrenees provide refuge for those beasts and wizards who want to distance themselves from civilization. Other areas of Mythic Europe are equally at your disposal, of course. Just remember that the covenant's locale will do much to define what sorts of stories you will be able to tell.

After your have chosen this initial setting, you should do some research. Textbooks, histories, scholarly journals and Ars Magica supplements like Mythic Europe will help you in this endeavor. Although you are not writing a dissertation, it will greatly enhance your credibility if you base your saga on fact.

After the initial adventures, continue to define your world. With each story, add details of geography, custom, and language. Evoke the world in every saga event, making it so alive that the players think of it as real. Your world is your own, and it acquires a unique identity as you play. Make of it what you will.

Official Ars Magica Fourth Edition material found in sourcebooks and supplements is set in the year AD 1220. You can, of course, feel free to set your stories at other times. You might want to begin your saga earlier, giving the characters and their covenant some time to develop, peaking at the "official" date.

## Motif

A motif is a recurring subject, theme, or idea that unites all the aspects of the saga in some subtle way. You may wish to invent some recurring feature that provides continuity and meaning. The answers to questions like "What is the dominating features of the saga?", "What issues is the covenant concerned with?", and "What issues galvanize and motivate each story?" will clarify your motif.

A motif can be anything from an ongoing rivalry with some foe to a solemn dedication to some ideal. It might be more ephemeral, such as the gradual decline of the Order of Hermes. Whatever the motif, make it appropriate and weave it into all your stories. The troupe should never forget the saga's focus.

## Passage of Time

Some sagas span generations, while others are as short as a few years. With time's passage, people and places change. Great events occur that forever mark the world. You need to decide what scope your saga will have, as this can affect the types of characters your players will want to create.

## Antagonists

No saga is complete without the presence of figures who threaten the characters. Were it not for the "black hat" there would be no conflict, and thus no interest. Without the shadow of evil, good would not gleam so brightly; one cannot exist without the other. Nor are antagonists necessarily unpopular. It's not difficult to recall at least one villain who is as entertaining as his counterpart. Adversaries should be works of art. Create villains your players love to hate.

Persistence should always be one of the villain's major attributes. Major antagonists will stay with your throughout your saga, so they should not wither up and blow away. Furthermore, there should always be some flaw in each major antagonist—some chink in an otherwise impenetrable defense. Finally, each major villain should have some sort of goal. The bad guys don't just wander aimlessly looking for bad things to do. They have a master plan, and a set of steps to get them there.

As the hero and villain repeatedly encounter each other their respective flaws become more and more well known to one another. An adversary who becomes this familiar may be dubbed an "archvillain." The archvillain seems to have nine lives, surviving by a hair and always returning to inflict harm upon the characters. And why not? Don't the characters make desperate escapes and miraculous rescues? The archvillain is a character who deserves to develop over the saga, earning experience points and improving just as the characters do.
