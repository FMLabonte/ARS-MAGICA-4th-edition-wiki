CHARACTERS

always interested in rumors and gossip, and are frequently able to extract personal secrets from people. Among magi the language is more dignified, but the idea is the same: you keep tabs on the Hermetic community (your covenant, your house, and nearby covenants—at the least). However, magi probably don't have much knowledge of what's going on among the lower class members of their covenant unless this Virtue is specific to those people.

Carefree: You are unshakably cheerful and happy in all circumstances. You receive +6 on all rolls to resist despair and sorrow (including spell effects) and +3 to Communication rolls when dealing with those who appreciate your disposition.

Cautious with (Ability): You are very careful with a specific Ability, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail when using it. You roll one less botch die than normal (minimum roll of one die) whenever you are required to roll botch dice.

Clear Thinker: You think logically and rationally. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to resist lies, confusion, befuddlement, and subterfuge—whether magical or mundane.

Close Family Ties: Your family is one of the most important things in your life, and still supports and aids you whenever possible, even at personal risk. Family members do not hesitate to do you any favor that is within their power, and can call on their friends and neighbors to help you. It works both ways, however; your family may require help from you some day.

Common Sense: Whenever you are about to do something contrary to what is sensible in the game setting, common sense (the storyguide) alerts you to the error. This is an excellent Virtue for a beginning player, as it legitimizes any help the storyguide may give.

Contortions: You are able to perform physical maneuvers beyond the scope of most people. Add your score in this Ability + Dexterity or Strength to any roll when attempting to break free of a hold or restraint, squeeze into a small space, or get through a small opening. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Contortions 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

Direction Sense: You have an uncanny ability to orient yourself and can determine which way is north by rolling Direction Sense + Perception of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Direction Sense 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

Dousing: You have the ability to find things beneath the earth through the use of a dousing rod (usually a forked stick) and your own intuitive sense. You concentrate on the thing to be found, hold your dousing rod out in front of you, and follow its subtle motions to the target. If you're looking for something specific, you must have an appropriate sympathetic connection to the thing sought (such as bottled water from a stream when searching for running water). Before you roll, designate the area in which you are searching—if the item sought is not present in that area, you automatically fail. The time required to search depends on the size of the area, and must be invested whether you succeed or not. To find something common, like water within 25 paces, requires a Perception + Dousing of 9+. Increased distances or dousing for less common things increases the target number. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Dousing 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

Educated: You have been educated in a Grammar School, and may have attended a university or cathedral school. You have a score of 3 in Speak Latin and 1 in Scribe Latin, and may purchase Academic Knowledges or Skills at character generation. You are at least (18 - Int) years old. Magi may not select this virtue—this sort of training is given to all starting magi.

Empathy: You can intuitively understand the emotional needs of others and can therefore respond to them more appropriately. Add your Empathy score to rolls on appropriate Traits such as Communication and Presence. In addition, you may apply one third (rounded up) of your Empathy score to Folk Ken rolls. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Empathy 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Enduring Constitution: You can withstand pain and fatigue. Decrease the penalties for reduced Body and Fatigue levels by one point. You also get +3 on rolls to resist pain.

Faerie Upbringing: Perhaps you were abandoned by your true kin, and the faeries found you. Maybe your family actually lived in a faerie forest, or faeries took you as a babe. Though you are now back in human society, you feel at home with and have an enhanced understanding of faeries, magic, and other strange things. You have the equivalent of the +1 Virtue Common Sense when dealing with Faerie. However, you find human society, including religion, bizarre. You cannot have Social Skills as starting Abilities, but may purchase the Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if you cannot otherwise buy Arcane Knowledges.

Free Expression: You have the imagination and creativity needed to compose a new ballad or to paint an original picture, and have the potential to be a great artist. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to create a new work of art.

Further Education: You have spent two years at a university or cathedral school in pursuit of higher learning. You have an additional seven experience points to spend on Academic Knowledges or Skills. This virtue may be taken multiple times. You may only take this Virtue if you already have the Educated or Magister in Artibus Virtue. In either case, your minimum age increases by two every time you take it. For example, an Educated character with Intelligence +2 who takes this virtue twice must be at least 20 years old. See Magister in Artibus on page 38.

Good Armaments: You can start with any standard armaments and one expensive weapon or piece of armor.

Healer: You have an empathic understanding of how to aid the wounded, the sick, and the suffering. Add one third (round up) your Healer score to any Chirurgy or Medicine roll, and to the recovery rolls of anyone you tend regularly. You can also use this Ability to calm the grieving and to soothe pain. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Healer 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Heir: You have little power or wealth now, but you stand to inherit land and possibly money. You need do nothing special to remain in your position, but others may occasionally attempt to remove you from the line of succession—one way or another. When you finally win your inheritance you gain its responsibilities as well, so your freedom may be restricted.

Herbalism: You are skilled at releasing the inherent magical properties of plants for use in potions, elixirs, pastes, and powders. Herbalism is particularly suited for some purposes, so you get bonuses when making certain kinds of substances: poisons +5, antidotes +5, healing and health +5, and hallucinogens +3. You can also identify plants, know when to harvest them, and understand their special properties. Choosing this Virtue confers the Knowledge Herbalism 1, which can be improved as any other Knowledge.

Higher Purpose: Let others concern themselves with petty matters, you have a nobler goal. This purpose should be altruistic, like freeing an oppressed people or bringing peace between the Order of Hermes and society. You gain +3 on Personality Trait rolls made to pursue your goal.

Indentured Servant: You have a personal attendant to cater to your everyday needs and desires. The servant generally follows your commands but is not trained to fight and is not highly skilled, having experience points in Abilities equal to his age in years. If the term of service is limited, and you want the servant to remain, you should provide some strong motivation. If your servant ever dies, or ends his service, you have no replacement.

Inspirational: You are a stirring speaker or a heroic figure, and can urge people to great efforts. You give targets a +3 bonus to rolls for
