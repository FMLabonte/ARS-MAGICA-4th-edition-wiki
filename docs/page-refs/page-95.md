CHAPTER IV
LABORATORY
95

sanctum of another, very few magi ever cooperate in laboratory work.

Nevertheless, there are times when magi receive help in their laboratory work, either from trusting magi or from apprentices. Anyone who has the Gift, Hermetic training (a Magic Theory score), and a positive Intelligence may help you to study Arts or Magic Theory from vis, or to perform any activity that uses your Magic Theory. If you are being helped to perform some activity that uses your Magic Theory, you add the helper's Magic Theory + Intelligence to your Lab Total for the season. If you are studying from vis, you add +1 to your studying roll for the season. If the assistant has some appropriate Virtue, like Inventive Genius, that Virtue affects the primary researcher's efforts, adding to his scores and rolls in the lab.

Thus, when two magi cooperate, one must always be the primary researcher and one must be the assistant. Even if magi are not in danger of attack from one another, very few are willing to spend a season in the role of lab assistant: the Hermetic social implications are unconscionable.

You may not normally have more than one helper in the lab, as it is difficult to coordinate several helpers with you and with each other. However, if people are exceptionally well-organized and cooperative, more can work together, each helper adding his Magic Theory and Intelligence scores to the primary researcher's scores. The total number of assistants that the primary researcher can make use of in one season is limited to his Leadership score (though he can always have at least one).

Lab assistants do not gain anything from the experience (that is, they do not gain experience in any Arts studied, nor do not learn newly researched spells).

## Distractions from Studies

The rules for what a magus can do in a season assume that the season is uninterrupted. Sometimes, however, magi take time away from their labs to travel and explore, and this lost time makes itself felt in their lab performance.

You may miss up to ten days from any laboratory activity, and make up the time by working harder during the remainder of the season. There is no penalty for this. However, your Lab Total is reduced by 1 for each day over ten that you miss, or, if you are studying, the Quality of the source you are studying from counts as though it were one level lower for every two days over ten that you miss.

If the procedure you are performing requires a full season, such as performing multiple tasks of the same kind, any interruption of more than ten days ruins the procedure, and any vis you have expended in the season is lost.

## Familiars

Protective of their secrets and suspicious of any who might hold power over them, magi are notoriously distant from other people. They can find some companionship with apprentices, but the master-apprentice bond atrophies after the apprentice becomes a magus, and sometimes former master and former apprentice become rivals. For longer-lasting and deeper companionship, many magi turn to familiars.

A familiar is a beast that a magus befriends and then magically bonds with, instilling the beast with magical powers in the process and then using magic to merge its powers and abilities with his own. Though a familiar is very close to the magus who creates it, it always has its own will, and is not under the control of the magus. The familiar is the closest friend and ally a magus will ever have . . . but even friends fight occasionally.

## Finding and Befriending an Animal

The first step in getting a familiar is finding an animal with inherent magic. With inherent magic, the beast is likely to have a Magic Might score, which may be assigned based on comparable scores of other magical creatures. The means of finding such a creature are ultimately left to the storyguide to determine. Wandering at random in search of a magical creature is usually profitless—magi generally follow rumors to the locations of the familiars they want. Some receive visions of animals that are somehow "meant" for them.

Once found, the animal must be befriended. You must genuinely admire or even love the animal in question, and it must trust you freely, under no coercion, magical or mundane. The animal can sense something of your nature when you are in close contact. If your natures clash, it rejects you. The need for mutual admiration between magus and familiar is why air magi, for example, often take birds as familiars, and why you can often tell something about magi by the familiars they have chosen and that have chosen them.
