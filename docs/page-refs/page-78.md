ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

When casting the second spell, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 15+. You gain a +3 bonus if the second spell is the same spell as the first or if the second target is the same as the target of the first. If you fail, the second spell is not cast and your action is wasted. If you botch, you lose the first spell as well. If you succeed, roll the second spell as normal.

## Casting from a Text

It is possible to cast a formulaic spell that you do not know yourself if you have a readable copy of it. Indeed, many powerful spells have never been learned by anyone but their inventors; they are cast almost exclusively from texts. To cast a spell from a text, you spend one round for every 5 levels of the spell, make a spellcasting roll on a stress die, and apply double the normal number of botch dice.

If your spellcasting roll does not equal or exceed the spell level, you lose one Fatigue level for every 5 points, or fraction thereof, by which you missed the spell level. If you go unconscious from Fatigue loss, the spell fails. Otherwise, the spell succeeds, whether you make the spellcasting roll or not. If you go unconscious and the spell fails, you must roll to see if you botch, even if the spellcasting roll was not a zero.

Ritual spells may be cast from a text, but they take much longer. You must spend 30 minutes for every 5 levels of the spell, and must expend raw vis, just as you do for casting the ritual from memory.

## Counteracting Spells

Sometimes you may want to nullify the effects of another magus's spell. There is no hard and fast means of doing so. Fast-cast spells (page 75) are one means, but as those spells are unrefined, their ability to dispel other magics is limited. Another, more common, means of nullifying another magus's spells is with a prepared spell of your own. There are numerous spells described in the Spells chapter that are designed to dispel other magics. Most of these spells are tailored to affect spells of their own Form and Technique. Most also involve rituals, so vis is a necessity. Some Vim spells, like Wind of Mundane Silence, are capable of counteracting any kind of spell or magic. In addition, spells like Aegis of the Hearth provide protection from magic in the first place.

## Certamen

Certámen (Care-TAH-men, Latin for "duel") is the ceremony by which two magi conduct a magical duel. It serves as a nonlethal way for one magus to establish dominance and precedence over another, and has formal restrictions to keep it from disrupting the unity of the Order. One need not accept a challenge to certámen, but the social cost may be no less than that of accepting and losing. You may challenge anyone to certámen once, but the Code prohibits you from challenging the same person again unless he challenges you in the meantime. Thus, you cannot hound an unwilling opponent into certámen. Certámen is solely an institution of the Order of Hermes; non-Hermetic wizards do not have the ability to participate in the ceremony.

To engage in certámen, you and the other magus must agree on one Form and Technique combination you will both use. If you do not agree on the Form and Technique, the duel cannot take place. By tradition, the aggressor in the duel chooses the Technique and the defender chooses the Form, but this system is purely artificial. The rules of certámen permit the use of any system for determining the Arts used as long as it is acceptable to both magi.

Once the Technique and Form are chosen, you and your opponent concentrate for a moment, both entering trances. While entranced, competing magi have no defense against physical attacks. Each becomes attuned to the magical forces surrounding them, shaping them into phantasms representing the Technique and Form of the duel. If the Technique and Form are Muto and Animál, the phantasms might be two animals, one controlled by each magi. During the course of the duel, each animal changes into various other animals in an effort to defeat the other. A Creo Ignem contest could consist of two fiery beings fighting. In an Intéllego Aquam contest it might appear that the combatants are in hazy water, each trying to reach some goal. The illusionary battle is a representation of the more subtle magical battle which affects the minds of the combatants.

To attempt to emerge the victor, each combatant rolls a stress die + Technique + Form + Intelligence + Certámen each round. The magus with the highest result determines the amount by which he beat the other combatant. These points can be used to weaken the other combatant immediately, or they can be saved and added to the next round's roll.

If used to weaken the opponent, roll a stress die + Intelligence + Certámen + the difference between your score and your opponent's score. Compare this to your oppo
