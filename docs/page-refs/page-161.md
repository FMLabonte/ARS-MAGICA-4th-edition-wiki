# Chapter VI
## Combat

Combat is a time of teamwork and excitement. In an environment where real achievement all too often comes in blurred half-steps, combat offers an opportunity for decisive victory. Each battle is a story in its own right, with its own heroes, villains, and plot.

**Ars Magica** combat is narrative—each player describes his character's actions dramatically, adding to the excitement of the combat as it unfolds. The rules presented here provide the framework upon which this narrative is based. The storyguide interprets the framework, controlling the battle.

When you run a combat, play it by ear. Freely assign situational modifiers to combat totals, giving bonuses to players who concoct intricate strategies that are both sound and entertaining. If an outcome is dramatically clear to the troupe, forego dice rolling. Feel free to use miniatures to represent the battlefield, but only if players continue to use their imaginations as well. You must work especially hard at helping the players properly visualize the scene. If you do so from the start, and everyone listens, you will avoid much confusion. Try to imagine exciting and varied settings for battles, and figure out how they will affect the melee. Battle is a time of peak emotions, so try to elicit every last scrap of excitement and agony.

## Introduction to Combat Scores

There are seven calculated scores that are often used in combat. It will speed up combat greatly if each character's scores are calculated before combat begins. In cases where a given character is likely to use more than one weapon, a score for each one is needed. These scores are based on Characteristics and Abilities, which you should know for each character, and other modifiers, which can be found on various tables and charts at the end of this chapter.

**Initiative**: Initiative reflects your character's ability to maneuver quickly and tactically on the battlefield.

$$
\text{INIT} = \text{QIK} + \text{WEAPON SKILL} + \text{WEAPON INITIATIVE BONUS} + \text{ENC}
$$

**Attack**: The Attack score represents your character's ability to connect with his weapon. Melee weapons use Dexterity to calculate this score while missile weapons rely on Perception.

$$
\text{ATK} = (\text{DEX OR PER}) + \text{WEAPON SKILL} + \text{WEAPON ATTACK BONUS} + \text{ENC}
$$

**Defense**: The Defense score represents your character's ability to execute a set of defensive postures and blocks in order to avoid incoming attacks. You cannot have a Defense score with a missile weapon. Characters holding missile weapons who must defend use their Brawling skill to determine their Defense score.

$$
\text{DFN} = \text{QIK} + \text{WEAPONS SKILL} + \text{WEAPON DEFENSE BONUS} - \text{SIZE} + \text{ENC}
$$

**Damage**: This score indicates how much harm you inflict when your weapon connects. Your character's Strength and Size are only added in melee combat.

$$
\text{DAM} = (\text{STR} + \text{SIZE}) \text{ OR } (\text{NOTHING}) + \text{WEAPON DAMAGE BONUS}
$$

**Soak**: This score reflects the amount of physical punishment your character can take before being genuinely hurt.

$$
\text{SOAK} = \text{STM} + \text{SIZE} + \text{ARMOR PROTECTION}
$$
