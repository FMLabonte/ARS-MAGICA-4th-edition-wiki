# Talons of the Winds

R: Near/Far, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Claw of a Hawk (+1)

Transforms a wind into an abrasive medium that tears and claws at everything in its path. Soft materials like leaves and cloth are shredded, and people take +5 damage from innumerable bloody cuts and abrasions. This spell cannot be cast if there is not a breeze of some sort blowing, thus making it difficult to use effectively indoors. The caster is not affected by the spell, even if the wind is blowing directly at him.

In Ossium of Bjornaer's version of this spell, which has an Imáginem requisite, a strange keening can be heard in the air as it cuts through targets. Ossium's wizards sigil manifests by making many of his spells eerie or frightening.

# Level 30

## Heat of Hell's Impending Doom

R: Per, D: Conc/Moon, T: Bound, Ritual

Requisites: Ignem, Rego

Air in the target area grows painfully hot, with the exception of the area within 10 feet of you. Those caught in this heat must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ every round or lose a Fatigue level. Body levels are lost once Fatigue levels are gone. Plants exposed to this heat for any long period of time will wither and die.

# Level 40

## Infernal Smoke of Death

R: Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Breath from a Poisonous Snake (+3)

Requisites: Perdo

Turns normal smoke from a fire into a thick, poisonous cloud. Anyone immersed the cloud of smoke takes +20 poison damage (once only) against which armor provides on half its normal Protection value. Soft materials like cloth, fur, paper, and leather are charred and ruined by exposure to the noxious vapor. While you concentrate, any new smoke becomes poisonous, but even after you stop concentrating, the poisonous smoke remains deadly. It dissipates after several hours. The smoke is heavier than air, so rolls along the ground, pooling in low spots. With a Rego casting requisite, the caster and the objects he carries are unaffected by the smoke, though it still obscures his vision.

# Level 45

## Fog of Confusion

R: Per, D: Year/Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Requisites: Imáginem, Rego

Turns all the fog within the target area into a silvery mist too thick to see through. Random screams, thumps, hisses, and other noises harass and confuse anyone within the fog, perhaps even leading them into danger. People have extreme difficulty navigating through the fog, especially through unknown territory. No more than seven people, who must be present at the ritual, can see normally through the fog.

# Level 50

## Rain of Oil

R: Sight, D: Spec, T: Sight, Ritual

Requisites: Ignem

Turns rain into droplets of oil. The rain of oil continues as long as the storm does, drenching the landscape with flammable liquid. The oil will evaporate at a natural rate after the rain ceases. A spontaneous Creo Ignem spell of level 25+ can ignite the storm so that the oil burns as it falls.

# Perdo Auram Guidelines

Destroying just one property of air is a bit easier than destroying air outright—such destructions are one magnitude lower than spells that destroy air outright. Causing the destruction of air with great precision raises the order of magnitude by at least one level.

Basic range is Touch, basic duration Momentary and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5**: Destroy an amount of air. Stop very minor weather phenomena, like breezes.

**Level 20**: Stop any one part of a weather phenomenon (for example, stop lightning from striking during a thunderstorm).

**Level 30**: Stop any weather phenomenon, excluding those caused by Ritual magic.

# Perdo Auram Spells

# Level 10

## Thief of the Stolen Breath

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+3)

Takes a creature's breath out of its lungs, causing panic and the instant loss of a Fatigue level, plus a second level unless a Stamina stress roll of 6+ is made. Casting requisite is Animál for beasts and Corpus for people. This spell cannot effect a target more than once a round.

# Level 15

## Room of Stale Air

R: Reach, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: Agate (+3)

Makes the air in a room stuffy and uncomfortable. Any creatures that breathe air suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls involving physical exertion. In addition, for each round of exertion a character must make a simple Stamina roll of 6+ or lose a Fatigue level. This may cause panic in some creatures or people. The speed at which the air refreshes itself depends on how well ventilated the room is. When using agate, a stone associated with both Mercury and the air, you must crush the
