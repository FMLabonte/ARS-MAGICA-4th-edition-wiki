THE ART OF MAGIC

# Tractatus

Tractatus (singular also tractatus) are texts that deal in depth with some aspect of an Art or Knowledge. Tractatus about Arts are written about a particular spell, while those concerning Knowledges are about some particular subject within that Knowledge. A tractatus is useful to students at any level of ability, because you can never know everything about your subject.

# Writing Tractatus

It takes one season to write a tractatus. In order to write a tractatus on an Art, the author must first master a spell that uses that Art, and then write the tractatus about this spell. A magus may write only one tractatus about a given spell, and the tractatus will concern the Art (of the two relevant to the spell) in which the magus has the higher score.

The magnitude of the spell cannot be higher than the author's Communication + Scribe total. The Quality of the tractatus is equal to the magnitude of the spell. For a tractatus on a Knowledge, the Quality is simply the author's Communication + Scribe. A person can only write a number of tractatus on a Knowledge equal to half his score in the Knowledge, rounded down.

For example, Quintus decides to write a tractatus. He has mastered Ball of Abysmal Flame, but that is a seventh magnitude spell, higher than his Communication + Scribe total of 5, and so he cannot write about it. He has also mastered Arc of Fiery Ribbons, which is fifth magnitude, and so he writes about that. The tractatus has a Quality of 5, equal to the magnitude of the spell, and is about Ignem, as Quintus only has a score of 18 in Creo.

A copyist can make a number of copies of an existing tractatus equal to his Scribe score in one season.

# Studying Tractatus

It takes one season to study a tractatus, and a given student may only study a given tractatus once, with benefit. The reader of a tractatus on an Art must already know the spell which the tractatus concerns, but need not have mastered it. It is not possible to learn a spell from a tractatus: the reader must have invented it himself, been taught it by another magus, or learnt it from a conventional spell text. The reader generates a Study Total equal to Intelligence + Concentration + Quality. If the book concerns an Art, he gets the Study Total in experience points. If it concerns a Knowledge, he gets experience points equal to the Study Total divided by 5 (rounded up).

For example, Quinta decides to study Quintus's tractatus. First, she learns Arc of Fiery Ribbons from the covenant library. She then spends a season studying the tractatus, gaining a study total of 11 (5 + 6). This gives her 11 experience points.

# Studying Vis

Vis is the raw stuff of magic, and study of it can reveal new insights about Hermetic magic. Magi can devote themselves to the study of vis in order to increase their Art scores or their knowledge of Magic Theory. In either instance, vis used in study is consumed in experimentation.

If you roll a zero when experimenting with vis, roll a number of botch dice equal to the number of pawns you studied. Whether or not you actually botch, you gain no experience points during a season where you rolled a zero. If you do botch, the storyguide may apply whatever botch results are deemed appropriate. If a botch demands a roll to avoid wizard's Twilight, add a simple die to the number of pawns of vis that were used to the strength of your aura to determine the strength of the supernatural power you must control.

# Learning Arts from Vis

Magi may study Arts from raw vis. To do this, a magus must have some pawns of vis appropriate to the Art he wishes to study available. He may study from one, two, or three pawns, deciding on the number of pawns at the beginning of the season, before making the die roll. The player then rolls a stress die, multiplies it by the number of pawns studied, and then adds the covenant's aura to get a Study Total. The magus gains this many experience points in the Art, but can gain no more than three full levels. Excess points are lost.

For example, Quintus, with an Ignem score of 24 (and no experience points toward the next level), decides to study from Ignem vis. He chooses to study from three pawns, and his player rolls a one, followed by another one, followed by a nine, for a result of 36. He multiplies this by three (the number of pawns) to get 108. Adding his covenant's aura, 4, gives him a final total of 112. Advancing from a score of 24 to a score of 27 costs 25 + 26 + 27, or 78 experience points. The remaining 44 points are lost, as Quintus cannot gain more than three full levels in a season.
