ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

When you fire a missile, the storyguide rates the difficulty of the shot and determines an ease factor that you must beat in order to successfully hit your target. The basic ease factor required is 6, but is further affected by modifiers that describe the target. These modifiers are given in the Missile Fire Table. Once the final ease factor is determined, roll a stress die + Attack score. If you exceed the ease factor, your shot is a success.

A character you hit loses one Body level for each full five full points by which your Damage Total exceeds his Soak. Your Damage Total equals your missile weapon's Damage score plus the amount by which your missile Attack Total exceeded the ease factor. For information on how Body levels work, see "Wounds" on page 177.

Firing into a melee combat is a risky proposition—it is quite possible to hit your friends. If you are firing into melee, add an additional +3 to your shooting ease factor. If this causes you to miss, and you would have hit otherwise (that is, without this modifier), you hit a friend. Determine damage as normal.

## Melee Modifiers Table

|  Situation | Modifier to Attack and Defense Totals  |
| --- | --- |
|  Engaged at one range inside a weapon's listed range | -6  |
|  Engaged at two ranges inside a weapon's listed range | -12  |
|  Using a single weapon held in off-hand* | -3  |
|  High ground (including mounted vs. unmounted) | +3  |
|  Attacking from surprise** | No Defense***  |
|  Charging*** | +3  |
|  Set for Charge*** | +3  |

*Or attacking with Weapon and Shield held backwards.

**Attacking from surprise means that the defender was engaged without his knowledge.

***The defender is not allowed to add his Defense score to his die roll.

***See definitions of charging under "Movement," above.

***A character with a suitable longshaft weapon may, if he has a higher Initiative Total than an opponent who is charging him, set his weapon against the charge and gain this bonus.

## 3. Melee

During the melee phase, hand to hand combat is resolved. The most important thing to realize is that each phase represents more than a single swing versus a single parry. A melee phase represents a combination of swings, parries, steps, dodges, half-turns, and other maneuvers. The actual composition of each attack can be narrated and fleshed out as the troupe desires—with great detail and emphasis on storytelling, or with little detail so that the group can move on to other things.

In order to keep the action flowing comprehensibly, the storyguide should divide large battles into small sub-melees and resolve each one separately in each round. A sub-melee is a subset of a large battle whose outcome for the round is not affected by the actions of characters outside the sub-melee. If you are fighting a bear while the rest of your party is otherwise occupied, you and the bear are one sub-melee.

## Optional Rules for Melee

In order to customize melee to the tastes of your troupe, the following optional rules can be used.

**No Carry-over**: In order to simplify and speed combat, you can eliminate the option of saving the difference in Attack Total and Defense Total as an advantage bonus. Instead, all damage must be done immediately.

**Separate Roll for Defense**: Instead of having each player roll once, and then adding both his Attack score for an Attack Total and his Defense score for his Defense Total, you can use a separate roll for each. Using this method, the character with the highest Initiative Total rolls and generates an Attack Total first, which he compares to his opponent's rolled Defense Total. Damage is resolved as normal. Next, the character with the lower Initiative Total rolls a new die and generates an Attack Total, and his opponent rolls a new die and generates a Defense Total. Damage is again resolved as normal.

**Absolute Weapon Ranges**: As the rules stand, characters receive a very large penalty for attacking and defending at ranges shorter than the listed ranges for their weapons. Since this penalty is, in many cases, overwhelming, you can simply forbid characters from attacking or defending when not at the optimum range for their weapon. (But note that characters can always use a brawling defense.)
