# Muto Ignem Spells

## Level 5

### The Many-Hued Conflagration

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+5)

Makes a fire burn brightly in shifting colors for an instant. Each being looking at the fire must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or be blinded for one round by the multicolored lights.

## Level 10

### Show of the Flames and Smoke

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Multi-Colored Streamers (+3)

Causes smoke of different colors, streams of flame, and strange popping and sizzling noises to come from a fire. The effect is so spectacular that onlookers are either entranced or horrified, depending on the circumstances. The pyrotechnics might ignite nearby flammable objects and cause minor bums to those within 2 paces of the fire.

### Hornet Fire

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Stinging Insect (+1)

Requisite: Rego

Turns a fire into a swarm of fireballs, each the size of a large insect, that fly and harass at your command. Their burning touch gives all those you indicate within 7 paces of the fire both a –3 penalty on all rolls and two extra botch dice. If using the focus, you throw the stinging insect into the fire.

## Level 15

### Prison of Flames

R: Reach/Far, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Small Iron Cage (+1)

Turns a bonfire into a prison shaped like a miniature castle. A person thrown into the middle is not burned, but takes +25 damage if he or she tries to escape.

## Level 25

### Trapping the Fire

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Requisite: Terram

This spell turns the heat and flames of a large campfire or bonfire into a small, very hard object, such as a gem or a piece of metal. If the object is broken, the flame returns, but dies if there is nothing to bum.

## Level 35

### Flames of Sculpted Ice

R: Near/Sight, D: Spec, T: Str

Spell Focus: Essence of a Water Elemental (+3)

Requisite: Terram

Turns a fire up to the size of a small house into ice. The ice forms beautiful sculptures of leaping flame, until it begins to melt. When the ice has melted halfway, the flames start again, but probably won't spread, because of wet surroundings.

## Perdo Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Momentary (the thing destroyed will not return except by natural processes), and basic target is Small.

Level 3: Greatly reduce the amount of light in an area.

Level 4: Completely extinguish all light in an area.

Level 5: Extinguish a fire, cooling the ashes to merely warm. Chill an object.

Level 10: Strongly chill an object. Destroy one aspect of a fire (for example, heat or light).

## Perdo Ignem Spells

## Level 15

### Soothe the Raging Flames

R: Reach/Far, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Chrysolite (+5)

Eradicates the heat of a bonfire, which, however, continues to burn until the fuel already covered in flame is consumed. The flames do not spread, or harm anything beyond what they were already burning. If the chrysolite spell focus is used, it is crushed during the casting of the spell. If the fire is extinguished and relit, it will burn hot again, as it is now a different fire.
