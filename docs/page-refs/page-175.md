STORYGUIDE

likes. The alpha storyguide does not even know where each "mini-saga" leads. To spread the work even thinner, your troupe may even want to assign different members to different mechanical duties. One may become the laboratory storyteller and adjudicate all lab efforts, and another may become the combat expert, keeping things flowing smoothly whenever combat occurs.

As you can see, each troupe has complete control over how they choose to organize their saga. No single method is the best one—rather, each troupe should choose one style based on the preferences of its members.

# The Storyguide

The role of a storyguide would, at first glance, seem to involve nothing more than catering to the desires of players. It's easy to believe your job is to "entertain the guests." There can be far more to it than that, however. The storyguide is able to inform as well as to entertain, to enliven as well as engage, to challenge as well as reward. In Ars Magica, the storyguide has the opportunity to weave an epic story in which the players can, through their characters, perform heroic acts and epic deeds that are the stuff of legend and myth.

When you take on the role of storyteller, you become a sort of super-camera. You are the eyes of the players, as a camera is the eye of a picture's beholder, but you are much more. You also need to be aware of all the things that characters can sense—things they can hear, things they can feel (both physically and emotionally), things they can intuit, things they can fleetingly guess. If you are ever in doubt of your awesome responsibility remember this: everything that you want the players know of your story, you must tell them.

# Character Roles

The role of Storyguide calls for a great deal of character acting. This is one of the most demanding tasks of storytelling, but can also be the most fun. You should try to make the non-player characters as three dimensional as you can. In literature, characters are often referred to as either "round" or "flat," that is, as either dynamic and believable or one-sided and stereotypical. Try to make your nonplayer characters (the important ones, at any rate) round. Give them convincing motivations and mannerisms, and make the way that they relate to the characters reasonable and believable. Remember that you can use Personality Traits as a shorthand to help you remember the unique personalities of the characters you portray. See page 62.

Being convincing in a role is accomplished by practice, and by accepting the fact that you sometimes look a little strange. Sure, sometimes you get to play the valorous knight who rides into the sunset astride a pale horse. On the other hand, you'll also get your share of playing the village idiot. The key is to ham it up—if you don't do it, your players certainly won't.

Indeed, the energy and vigor you put into your characters is often absorbed by the players. If you are listless and insipid in your roleplaying, they will be too. If your excitement comes through in your characters, though, the whole story picks up. The way you play your roles is one of the most direct and immediate ways to affect the energy and emotional intensity of the game, so put some effort into it.

# Storyguide Advice

There is very little one can say with assurance about being a storyguide that someone else won't oppose. Truth be told, there is really no right or wrong way to be a storyguide. Basically, if you can keep the players enthusiastic about the game, you're doing a good job. Even if you're doing well, though, it's unlikely that you have no room for improvement. Some advice for storyguides follows—act on it as you will.

# Things to Do

Let the players control their characters. Never restrict the players' freedom of expression. Players have little say in how the world functions, save through their characters' actions and statements. If this freedom is restricted, the players may as well stay home. Besides, with all the nonplayer characters you have to enact in a story, influencing the player characters' actions only adds to your burden.

Describe things in detail. The more lavishly you describe things the more your players can envision them. Get your troupe to close their eyes while you describe things and people. Imagination is a very potent tool; use it to your advantage.

Reward roleplaying. Just like children, we want rewards for a job well done, even if that reward is nothing more than verbal praise. So, if a member of your troupe plays above and beyond the accepted norm, don't let his efforts go unrewarded. Publicly thank him for the session. With luck, this will inspire dramatic competition in the next game session.

Ask your players' opinions on rules. Because the rules of play have a profound effect on character actions, let your troupe decide on what's best when the need for an interpre-
