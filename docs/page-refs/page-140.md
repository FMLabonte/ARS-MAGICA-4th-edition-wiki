ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Creates an illusory face on a wall or other flat object. The visage can speak up to 20 words before the spell expires. Individual wizards' sigils can produce very interesting differences in how the voice sounds, how the face looks, and so on.

## Level 20

### Phantasmal Animal

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A topaz (+3)

Creates an image of any animal or beast up to the size of a horse (Size +2). Under your direct mental command, it moves about and makes appropriate noises. You need to be able to concentrate whenever you wish to direct the illusion to move in some manner. Note that the image has no scent (or taste), and that this may be noticed by real animals (or people). Of course, a magus may not use this spell to create the image of an animal he or she does not know exists.

### Phantasmal Fire

R: Reach/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A ruby (+3)

Makes an image of a fire (up to the size of a large campfire) that dances, illuminates, crackles, and (apparently) warms. It does not spread, burn, or protect against cold. Makes a great joke at gatherings of House Flambeau, although creating a real fire is even more popular.

## Level 25

### Phantasm of the Human Form

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Clay model of a person (+1)

Makes an image of a clothed and equipped person that can make noise. Under your direct, unspoken command, the person can move about, speak, and behave as a human does.

## Level 40

### The Shadow of Human Life

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Violet Amethyst (+1)

Requisite: Mentem

The human image created (as in Phantasm of the Human Form) has limited freedom and simulated intellect. It functions as an independent human, albeit a stupid one, capable of interpreting general orders in new situations.

## Intéllego Imáginem Guidelines

Generally, these spells have the least to do with illusions of all the Imáginem spells, because one detects an image without altering or controlling it. These spells improve upon your senses by bringing in images (usually sounds and sights) not normally available.

The basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Room. Note that seeing or hearing into another room, the past, or a hundred miles away does you no good if there is no light or sound there. As in CrIm spells, each additional sense you wish to perceive increases the level of the spell by one magnitude.

**Level 5:** Use one sense at a distance. Memorize or perfect your memory about an image you have encountered. Be able to discern your own false images.

**Level 10:** Use two senses at a distance.

**Level 15:** Use three senses at a distance.

**Level 20:** Use four senses at a distance. See up to five years into the past.

**Level 25:** Use all senses at a distance.

## Intéllego Imáginem Spells

### General

### Discern the Images of Truth and Falsehood

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Moon, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+3)

You can tell whether an image has been created or altered through a spell, seeing both the original and false images in the case of alterations. Roll a stress die, adding the level of this spell +5 when you cast the spell; any illusion spells higher than your roll are not discerned. If you botch the roll, you mistake illusions for the real thing and reality for illusion.

## Level 2

### Discern Own Illusions

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Glass Eye (+2)

This spell makes your own illusions largely transparent, but still discernible. Use of vis to extend the range allows you to confer this benefit upon someone else.

## Level 20

### The Ear for Distant Voice

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Rock Crystal (+3)

You can hear what is happening in the place you designate. You must have an arcane connection with the place or with a person there.

### Eyes of the Past

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Sight, Ritual

Shows what happened in your present location at a specific time in the past, up to five years ago. You can see what happened in the past as if you had been standing where you are when the events took place. When looking at the past, you must view a continuous slice of time—you cannot scan around or quickly run through events.
