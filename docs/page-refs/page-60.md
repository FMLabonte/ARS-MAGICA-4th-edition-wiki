ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Before you begin this step, it might be helpful to think about what sort of spellcaster your magus is. Did he specialize in one or two Arts during his apprenticeship? Did he learn many spells of moderate power, or only a few of great magnitude? You should make sure you have at least some understanding of the magic system before you make these decisions, because a poor decision now can seriously curtail your potential for development in the future.

## Magical Arts

Each magus has a score in each of the 15 magical Arts (though a given rating could be 0). Each Art is described in detail in the Magic section beginning on page 65. Again, it is highly recommended that you are familiar with that section before you create a magus character.

You purchase Art scores the same way that you buy. Abilities, spending a certain number of points to purchase a given score. You are allowed 150 points to divide amongst the Arts, though certain Virtues and Flaws may increase or decrease this value. The cost to purchase a given Art score from a base of 0 is listed in the Art Score Cost Table.

## Spells

Magus characters fresh from apprenticeship start with no more than 150 levels of formulaic spells, unless a Virtue or Flaw changes that total. Spells of a level higher than your Technique + Form + Intelligence + 10 cannot be initially known. (The Technique and Form are those of the spell in question.) Spells above that level are too difficult to learn at this point.

Many common formulaic spells are described in the Spells chapter—you are free to select any of them to fill out your initial allotment. This list is by no means exhaustive, however. With the permission of the storyguide, you may begin the game with spells of your own devising. You should determine the level of such spells according to the normal guidelines (see “Inventing Spells,” pp. 80-82).

## Wizard’s Sigil

You should select your character’s sigil—the special feature that manifests itself when he casts spells. Sigils never have concrete mechanical effects like causing more damage or making spells more effective. Rather, they are secondary manifestations that allow for roleplaying. Examples might
