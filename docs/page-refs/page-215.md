CHAPTER X

MYTHIC EUROPE

fealty to Alexander also hold lands as vassals of the king of England, a situation that can generate tension and conflicts.

# Wales

Wales is not well known to most of Europe, and its inhabitants are thought to be pagans. It is a poor country whose people constantly struggle to stay just ahead of starvation, even burning earth for heat. Wales is composed of several kingdoms that war continually; practically the only thing all Welsh agree on is that they dislike the English more than one another.

The countryside is mountainous, bordered on three sides by the sea. The valleys experience mild winters and moderate summers, with plenty of rain, but in the high mountains, temperatures are much cooler and the winters can be quite severe.

# England

England forms the largest part of the British Isles. In the north are the Pennines, a ridge of high, angular hills separated by deep, flat-bottomed valleys. The eastern slopes are gentle, while the western ones are steep and harsh. To the south are the flat Lowlands, and the eastern edge of the island is very marshy. The weather is generally cool, with moderate winters and summers. There is considerable rainfall: the amount varies seasonally, and is most heavy in the winter.

Much of the country of the English has been tamed to farming, and it is a fertile and productive land. The forests that still linger, though, are the refuge of all manner of beasts, both fantastic and mundane, driven from their ancient homes.

The English kings are descended from the Normans, themselves of Viking stock, and they are much attached to the taking of land. England is currently ruled by King Henry III, considered a vast improvement over the previous king, John, who was seen as tyrannical and foolish. The English political landscape is unique. On the one hand, since the Norman Conquest of 1066, the monarchs have been undisputed overlords of the country. On the other, the nobility and general population has been bolstered by the concessions granted by King John in the Magna Charta of 1215. An English identity is emerging with the blending of Norman and Anglo-Saxon, and the creation of an independent landed gentry out of the two.

Between England and France lies the English Channel, a strait of sea that a clear day may allow sight across. However, it is often plagued with storms. One story claims that a knight who set out to cross it by boat was blown back to his starting place thirty days later, never having gained the other side.

# Western Europe

# Iberia

The Iberian peninsula projects from the southwest of France far into the great ocean. There, south of Toulouse and Aquitaine, lie the Christian kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Navarre, and the Catalan districts surrounding Barcelona. The kingdom of Portugal hugs the west coast, having recently conquered land formerly held by the Moors.

On the southern third of the peninsula is the former Caliphate of Cordoba (called Andalusia by the Christians), a Moorish land of learning and culture. The Christian states to the north are slowly but surely pushing back the Moors, who once controlled most of Iberia, in a long-running crusade known as the Reconquista (Reconquest). Skirmishes break out frequently on the border, and the traveler is advised to be wary.

# Aragon and Catalonia

A twelfth century marriage united these lands under a single crown. The present ruler, James, is a mere boy of twelve. History will name him "the Conqueror" for his future wars against the Moors.

These lands are a collage of cultures and peoples. Moorish influence remains strong, as do the ideals of Provençal culture to the north. Settlers have come from as far away as England to populate land reclaimed by Christendom. To encourage settlement, peasants in these lands have been granted more liberty than their counterparts in many other lands enjoy.

The military orders are a powerful force here, in politics and war as well as spirituality and the Church. The Knights Templar, in particular, have a great deal of influence over young James.
