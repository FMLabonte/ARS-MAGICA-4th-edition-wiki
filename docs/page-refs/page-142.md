ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Stamina and adding or subtracting an appropriate Personality Trait to see what the effects are. The nature of the Personality Trait used determines how it affects the Stamina roll. A Trait like Brave makes you resistant to fear, while one like Cowardly reduces the result of your roll.

|  Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
|  0 or less | Scared to death (literally)  |
|  1-5 | Incapacitated with fear, permanent –1 to Stamina  |
|  6-9 | Incapacitated with fear  |
|  10-15 | Flee, fight at –6 if cornered or obstructed  |
|  16+ | Carry on, –3 on all rolls  |

A hand of glory is the hand of a recently dead convicted murderer and is a very powerful ingredient in many necromantic spells and diabolic summonings

## Perdo Imáginem Guidelines

In addition to destroying created images, these spells dull the sensual properties of things—making wine tasteless, sneaks silent, and magi invisible. Destroying the images of moving things is more difficult—add one level of magnitude to spells that do so. This is normally a part of the spells listed. For example, the effect of Taste of the Dulled Tongue remains in effect even if the food in question is moved around and eaten.

The basic range is Reach, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 5: Destroy an object's ability to affect a single sense.
Level 10: Destroy an object's ability to affect two senses.
Level 15: Destroy an object's ability to affect three senses.
Level 20: Destroy an object's ability to affect four senses.
Level 25: Destroy an object's ability to affect five senses.

## Perdo Imáginem Spells

### General

#### Dispel the Phantom Image

R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Group

Spell Focus: Black Onyx (+3)

Destroys the image from any CrIm spell whose level you match or exceed on a stress die + the level of your spell.

### Level 4

#### Taste of the Dulled Tongue

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Small

Spell Focus: A tongue (+2)

Hides the taste of any substance, liquid or solid.

#### Removal of the Conspicuous Sigil

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Small

Spell Focus: A fern seed (+5)

Grooves, runes, writings, and similar markings are obscured so that they are not visible, but the overall shape of the medium remains constant. For example, runes carved into a sword blade can be made invisible, making the sword appear normal. Fern seeds may only be found on Midsummer's Eve; during the rest of the year they are nonexistent.

### Level 5

#### Invisibility of the Standing Wizard

R: Reach, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A fern seed (+3)

The target becomes invisible, but the spell is broken if the target moves (aside from breathing and shifting slightly in place).

#### Illusion of Cool Flames

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A coal (+1)

A source of heat, such as a fire, seems to lose its heat and drop to the surrounding temperature. It still, however, has its normal beneficial and harmful effects (that is, glowing coals still cook meat or burn a person's hand, though they do not feel hot).

### Level 10

#### Silence of the Smothered Sound

R: Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A feather (+3)

Makes one being or object incapable of producing sound. Magi who cannot utter their magic words suffer the normal penalties to their spellcasting rolls.

#### Veil of Invisibility

R: Touch/Reach, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A fern seed (+1)

The target becomes completely undetectable to normal sight, regardless of what it does, but still casts a reflection in a mirror.

### Level 15

#### Chamber of Invisibility

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Group

Spell Focus: A fern seed (+1)

Causes a Group of creatures to become invisible. (If you cast with a Rego requisite, the affected creatures can see each other.) Any affected character who moves or is touched makes everyone visible.

## Rego Imáginem Guidelines

These spells make things appear to be somewhere other than where they actually are. As with CrIm and PeIm, it is slightly harder to affect moving objects. Add one level of magnitude to spells that do so. Add a further level of magnitude if the image is to move along with the object. Add one level of magnitude to the guidelines for each additional sense to be affected.
