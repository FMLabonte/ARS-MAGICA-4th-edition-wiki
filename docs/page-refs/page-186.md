ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

(unless part of the practice or training) and engaging in adventures almost certainly does. Guarding the covenant might not (especially if the character in question is training with arms in the courtyard), but the storyguide will want to take circumstances like those into account when thinking about the actual ability of the covenant to repel invaders or notice threats. Characters who have Virtues or Flaws that give them the obligation to spend a season or more each year in the service of some other party may not practice, train, or study in those seasons (unless the storyguide specifically rules otherwise), but may gain Knowledges through exposure.

## Using Experience Points

Experience points are used to increase Ability scores, accumulating until their total exceeds the current score by one. At that point the score increases by one and the accumulated experience points are cleared. Raising the score again requires accumulating enough points to exceed the new number. For example, say that a given character has the Skill Sing at a score of three. Experience in Singing will accumulate over time. When four experience points have accumulated, the character's Sing score becomes four, and his experience points in Sing are reset to zero.

A magus can also use experience points to Master spells (see "Mastering Spells" on page 75). This requires accumulating one experience point for every five levels of a spell. It is not necessary to exceed the spell level, as with an Ability score. When the necessary points accumulate the spell is mastered.

## Story Experience

At the end of each story, the storyguide determines how successful the characters were and to what extent their actions reflected their natures. They are then rewarded with experience points in proportion to their success and role-playing skill. There's no rule on the number of points you must award—it depends on how quickly you want characters to advance and on the magnitude of their accomplishments. Guidelines are provided below, but feel free to ignore them altogether and use your intuition to set the pace of advancement.

## Story Magnitude

Guidelines for experience awards based on the danger and impact of the story are listed below. Remember that these are guidelines only, and should vary based on how quickly you would like the characters to advance.

**Trifling:** The story is a bit of a lark with no real dangers involved or no substantial knowledge gained. Such a story does not merit any experience point due to magnitude, though experience should still be awarded for roleplaying (as described below).

**Moderate:** The story involves a modicum of hardship and danger, and the characters were threatened with death or injury at least once. Stories where the lives or livelihoods of a few dozen people hang in the balance also fall into this category. Such stories are worth 1-2 experience points for magnitude.

**High:** Stories involving great danger to the characters or where large number of lives hang in the balance fall into this category. Such adventures are worth 2-3 experience points.

**Extreme:** If the characters faced death at every turn and their actions saved or affected the lives of entire populations, the story fits into this category. Appropriate awards for stories of this magnitude are 3 or more experience points.

## Roleplaying

A character who was decently roleplayed should receive one experience point per story in addition to those given for success. Two points may be awarded for exceptional role-playing. A player who doesn't act much but who enthusiastically involves his character in ongoing activity should probably still get roleplaying experience, particularly for self-sacrifice to save the group.

## Spending Story Experience

Experience earned after a story can only be spent on Abilities that the character used during that story, whether a roll was called for or not. For instance, leading a party through a wood requires appropriate forester skills, and even though die rolls may not have been required in the course of the story, experience points can be applied to appropriate Wilderness Skills. Even if a roll was involved, it need not have been successful—failure is often as instructive as success. Conversely, in order to spend experience on mastering a spell, a magus must have successfully cast that spell during the story.

A character can invest no more than one experience point in any given Ability per story.
