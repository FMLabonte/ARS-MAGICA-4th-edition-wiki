THE ART OF MAGIC

The storyguide should be careful to consider the possible side effects of any fast-cast defense used: for example, a fast-cast Perdo Ignem defense might destroy an incoming attack completely, but a Rego Ignem defense might only protect the magus, deflecting the fire into another combatant.

# Recognizing Spells

The Form required for fast-cast defense against a certain mundane attack is easy to determine (for example, ReTe would be a good choice for redirecting sword swings), but for fast-cast defenses against magic, you must at least be able to determine the Form of the magic you are defending against, or you will be unable to construct an appropriate defense.

If the attacker is a Hermetic magus and is using words you can hear or gestures that you can see, then you can determine both the Technique and the Form of the attacking spell automatically. However, Awareness rolls may be required for you to perceive the words or gestures used if the magus is using soft speech or subtle gestures (see "Words and Gestures," below), or if there are distractions, such as the loud noises of nearby battle.

In all cases where the Form and Technique are not obvious, you must make an Awareness roll of  $9+$  to recognize the Form and Technique of the attacking magic. If the attacking spell is Hermetic, you may add your Magic Theory to this roll. If you fail to determine the Form of the attacking magic, and still want to chance a fast-cast defense, you must guess at the Form and hope you're right.

# Words and Gestures Table

|  Voice | Modifier  |
| --- | --- |
|  Booming | +1  |
|  Firm | 0  |
|  Soft. | -5  |
|  None | -10  |
|  Gesture | Modifier  |
|  Vigorous. | +1  |
|  Bold | 0  |
|  Subtle. | -2  |
|  None | -5  |

It is also possible to exaggerate your motions and yell at the top of your lungs in casting a spell to make the elements of magic respond more obediently to your commands. Use the Words and Gestures Table to determine your penalty when casting subtly or with excessive vigor. The modifiers listed are cumulative. For example, if you are using soft words and subtle gestures, your penalty is  $-7$ . If you are making subtle gestures but screaming at the top of your lungs, your penalty is  $-1$ .

If you cast a spell without any gestures, you do not suffer penalties to your spell rolls for being encumbered.

# Words and Gestures

Normally all spellcasting requires the use of a firm tone of voice and bold hand gestures. It is possible to cast either a formulaic or spontaneous spell without the firm voice and strong gestures that are typical, but doing so makes the spell more difficult to cast.

# Extra Care

You may wish to spend extra time preparing to cast a spontaneous spell or a non-ritual formulaic spell in order to be more careful and to increase your chances of casting the spell correctly. Ritual spells may not
