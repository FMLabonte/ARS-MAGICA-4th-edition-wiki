CHAPTER II

CHARACTERS

include special scents that are produced when the character works magic, specific colors that are produced in spells, strange or enchanting noises that occur when magic is worked, and the like. The sigil you choose holds true across all types of magic, so a character whose sigil was the scent of brimstone would produce that effect whether casting Ball of Abysmal Flame or Soothe Pains of the Beast.

# Finishing Couches

At this point in the process of character creation you should know quite a bit about your character. Only a few final details remain, which will be covered in this section.

# Reputation

Reputations describe how others expect your character to behave, and affects how they act towards him. Unless a Virtue or Flaw gives your character a Reputation, he has none at the beginning of the game. If your character does have a Reputation before play begins, you will decide on an appropriate type and assign it a score that you feel best describes it.

Reputations are recorded as a word or brief descriptive phrase, a numerical level, and a target group, for example "Fearless 3, among the grogs of the covenant." The word or phrase simply describes the type of reputation. The level ranges from 1 to 10 (with 5 being a practical maximum) and reflects the intensity of the character's fame (or infamy).

The group tells who knows of the Reputation. Sometimes, descriptions will refer to a "good" or "bad" reputation. This should be loosely interpreted—there is no absolute list of reputations divided into good and bad. Use common sense and your storyguide's assistance, if need be.

For information on how Reputations function in play, how you can gain and lose Reputations, and how far your Reputation may precede you, refer to the "Reputation" section of the Storyguide chapter on page 191.
