ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

young. On the other hand, too wide a separation produces magi who progress too quickly, while companions and grogs rapidly age and deteriorate.

One solution is to set a standard, such as one story per year. Or you could also use a simple die roll to determine the number of seasons that pass between stories. A more complex approach would be to string together several connected adventures one after another, followed by a lull of several seasons or even years. If you have no standard, each storyguide can decide on how much time passes before the next story is played.

Stories should punctuate characters' lives, but also allow them to grow. Remember that few people make their living by adventuring. Adventures are the exceptional activities that happen only once in a long while. Characters must support themselves by other means between stories.

## Beginnings and Endings

The time immediately before and immediately after a story is important for keeping track of character and covenant progress. A few items should take place before and after each story.

### Before

- Determine what characters have been doing since the last story. Figure out how much experience they have earned, and what new Abilities they have gained.
- Determine the effects of aging on older characters, if one or more winters have passed since the last story.
- Fill the players in on events that have taken place in the world around their covenant since the last story, especially events that have affected them in major ways.
- Roleplay a council meeting of magi to establish their reactions to events that have occurred between stories, and to set the scene for the story about to begin.

### After

- Assign experience points earned during the story, and make appropriate adjustments to Personality Traits and Reputations.
- Account for what's happened during the story—characters divide treasure, recover from wounds, and improve the covenant library. Determine what major non-player characters have done or might do in response to the characters' actions.

- Make plans for the covenant's future, based on events of the story. You may want to roleplay another council meeting, where the magi discuss their options and intents.

## Outside Events

Although the players' characters are without a doubt the centerpiece of your saga, remember that the rest of the world exists largely independent of their influence. There are many other people outside the covenant, and some of them have a tremendous impact on the ongoing saga. Most of them have their own plans that have little to do with the activities of the characters. Time influences people and places everywhere, even when the characters do not witness it. If you set major events into motion "offstage," however, make sure that you consult with any other troupe storyguides who are involved in running stories. This will help you avoid inconsistencies.

## NPC Roles

While the player characters can have a lot of fun interacting with one another, equal or perhaps greater excitement can be had in dealing with non-player characters. Dealing with them does not mean killing them—simply talking with interesting people, or engaging in politics and intrigue, can prove very rewarding.

## Creating Roles

Of course, to play good characters, you'll have to create good characters. One of the best ways, and one of the easiest, is to observe the characters of others and emulate them. Short stories, books, magazine articles, television shows, movies, and even the evening news are full to the brim with personalities. You probably won't want to borrow them wholesale, but you'll be surprised at how much you can get away with simply by changing a name.

Of course, the rules for Ars Magica also suggest a wealth of interesting characters. From the house templates for magi to the various virtues and flaws, there are characters that beg to be created and portrayed. Your players can only do so many. You can step in and fill the gaps.

You can tell how well you're portraying your characters with the unknowing assistance of your players. When they talk amongst themselves, in or out of character, the good storyteller's players refer to his different characters as separate entities. If you reach a point where your characters are completely dissociated from your identity, you can perform
