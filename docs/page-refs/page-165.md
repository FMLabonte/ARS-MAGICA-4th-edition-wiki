CHAPTER VI
COMBAT
165

cannot attack that opponent with that weapon this round. Furthermore, any advantage bonus (see “Melee” below) accumulated from the previous round are lost.

## 2. First Missiles

There are two missile phases per round, one before Melee and one after Melee. This simulates the fact that each missile weapon fires at a different rate depending on the nature of the weapon and the user's speed and proficiency.

### Missile Fire Table

|  Target Condition | Ease Factor Adjustment  |
| --- | --- |
|  Target in Touch or Reach Range | No firing possible  |
|  Target in Close or Near Range | +3  |
|  Target in Middle Range | 0  |
|  Target in Far Range | +6  |
|  Target is Obscured (darkness or cover) | +3  |
|  Target is unmoving or walking carefully | 0  |
|  Target is hustling | +3  |
|  Target is sprinting | +6  |
|  Target is size 0 | 0  |
|  Target is small | + (absolute value of Size)  |
|  Target is large | - Size  |
|  Target is dodging or defending | Defender's Defense*  |
|  Shooter aims | -3**  |
|  Target has a shield | + Dfn value of shield***  |

*If you are firing at an opponent who has spotted you and defensively engaged you in the movement phase, your ease factor is modified by his Defense score (as reflected on the table), but he must count you as an opponent that he has engaged.

**Spending a whole missile phase taking no action but aiming gives this bonus, provided that the shooter does not move or otherwise act before actually firing.

***That is, the value that shield is assigned in the Weapon Table, not the Defense score of the character who carries the shield. If a character with a shield is actively defending against you, then yes, the shield does count twice.

Some speedy shooters will be able to loose missiles twice per round—once per missile phase. Others, because of slow weapons or sluggish wits, will be able to fire less often.

Which missile phase(s) you fire in depends on your Initiative score, and is reflected in the Missile Rate Table. This table assumes that the archer is spending all of his time between each actual shot reloading and prepping his weapon. If an archer does not do this, any round that he does not prep does not count. For example, if a character who is using a weapon with a –12 Initiative score fires one round and runs to a new position the next round, he cannot fire again in the third round because he can only fire every other round when he has spent the intervening round engaged in loading and upkeep.

If the order that projectiles are loosed makes a difference in a situation, the character with the highest Initiative Total fires first, followed by the next highest, down to the lowest. Thus, it is possible for one quick archer to slay another before the second has time to shoot back.

### Optional Longbow and Crossbow Damage Rule

Longbows and, to a lesser extent, crossbows, are very dangerous weapons in Mythic Europe. While there are accounts of arrows fired from short bows accumulating by the dozens, stuck in the armor of mounted knights, longbows and crossbows could often penetrate that armor and kill in a single shot. At the storyguide's option, projectiles fired from longbows and crossbows can do one Wound level of damage for every two points that the Damage Total exceeds the target's Soak, rather than for every five points.

### Optional Called Shots Rule

Archers can be allowed to make called shots, aiming for special targets either in hopes of causing extra damage or having some other special effect. The storyguide should assign a modifier based on the Size of the targeted area (which is cumulative with other modifiers). If the roll is missed, the shot fails. If it succeeds, the result depends on the target. If the intent was to do extra damage by striking an exposed area, damage is figured according to the Optional Longbow and Crossbow Damage Rule, above (even if the weapon being fired was not a Longbow or Crossbow). If the archer intended to have some other effect, the storyguide should use common sense to adjudicate.
