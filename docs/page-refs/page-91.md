CHAPTER IV
LABORATORY

potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, previous lab texts are useless because you are creating a whole new formula.

If you create a longevity potion and make a lab text of it, that text is only of use to you. Longevity potions are too personalized for their lab texts to be used for the potions of others. However, if you're creating a longevity potion for another and make a lab text of your work, you can refer to that text when making more potions of the same formula for that individual.

When using a lab text, basic elements of the original project can't change. The type of enchantment (that is, invested or lesser) must remain the same. The form and material of the magic item must remain the same (that is, form and effect bonuses given by the "Form and Effect Bonuses Table" must not change), and if the original power affected the device itself, then so must the duplicated power.

If any vis was used to increase Lab Total when making the original batch of potions or invested power, you must use the same type and amount of vis when using the lab text, but you still gain +5 to your Lab Total per pawn of vis used for that purpose. If you do not use the same vis, you gain no benefit from the lab text.

You can use the lab texts of another magus to reproduce his creations. You gain the bonus of his Magic Theory score at the time he wrote the text. However, reproducing the project of another magus with the aid of another magus's lab text is useless unless your Magic Theory is higher than the Magic Theory of the magus who created the original lab text. When you reproduce another magus's work by referring to his lab text, you create your own lab text. If you do the same project again in the future, you can use either your own lab text, or use the other magus's lab text, not both.

## Translating Laboratory Texts

A magus's lab texts, like notes for spells, are not generally found in a format suitable for others to use. For others to read your notes, you must make a legible copy. You can translate lab texts for a number of projects equal to your Scribe Latin score per season.

In order to use the lab texts of another magus, you must decode that magus's personal writing style and then translate his notes into a form you can use. The whole process takes a season, at the end of which you have the notes for one of the magus's lab projects—his notes on making a certain potion, or investing a certain device. The rules for decoding and translating lab notes are the same for those of spell notes (see "Translating Spells," page 82).

## Investigating Enchantments

If you wish to determine the powers of someone else's enchantment, you must investigate it in your lab. You inspect the item's physical construction, investigate the Form and Technique with Intéllego magics, and test to see how the enchantment responds to other magics. All of this indicates how the item was created, what its powers are, and how to unleash them.

You discover the powers in an enchanted device in order from weakest to strongest, that is, from the power of the lowest effect level to that of the highest. (A device's function as a talisman is treated as a level 20 power.) When you investigate an enchantment for the first time, you spend a season, add a stress die to your Intéllego Vim Lab Total, add in your aura, and compare the result to the level of the weakest power in the enchantment. If you succeed in your roll to find the weakest power, you may roll again in that same season to identify the power immediately above it in strength. For example, if a device has three powers of level 10, 20, and 30 and you rolled a Lab Total of 25, you do not automatically find the first two powers. As your rolled Lab Total is over 10 (the level of the first power), you find the first power and may roll again in the season to find the second power (level 20), and the third power if you discover the second. Note that the level of a power in an enchanted device includes any effect modifications that apply to the power (see "Invested Devices," page 85).

As long as you succeed in finding powers, you keep rolling to find more in that season. If you roll and find nothing, it either means that there are no more powers in the enchantment or that you did not roll high enough to find the next one. Only the storyguide knows for certain. In either case, you can keep trying as long as you want, but each failure to discover a power ends the rolls for that season, and you can do nothing else that season.

If you botch an investigation roll, many results can arise, and the storyguide makes the final decision based on the situation. You could misinterpret a power, thinking it does something different from its actual function. You could misread the triggering action of a power, making it useless to you. Or you could somehow disturb the enchanted item, setting off its powers. If you survive an investigation botch, your season ends there. However, you may approach the device again next season to properly identify the power that confounded you.

Magi sometimes use the Watching Ward (see page 160) to guard their enchanted devices. The spell held in waiting is often released on anyone who magically examines the
