CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
63

# Health and Fatigue

The average adult human of Size 0 has six Body levels (Unhurt, Hurt, Light Wounds, Medium Wounds, Heavy Wounds, and Incapacitated) and six Fatigue levels (Fresh, Winded, Weary, Tired, Dazed, and Unconscious) that describe his possible conditions. You may have additional levels if your size is some number other than zero. Characters of Size +1 usually have an extra Hurt Body level and an extra Winded Fatigue level. Characters of Size -1 lose those Body and Fatigue levels entirely. For information on how Health and Fatigue function in game terms, refer to page 177.

# Equipment

You must decide what possessions your character has. This equipment is limited by the resources of the covenant, unless a character has a Virtue or Flaw that allows her to have more expensive equipment. The covenant almost always provides its members' mundane supplies (such as rations, basic clothing, and the like), but you should keep track of personal items, such as fine clothes and writing equipment.

In general, grogs are restricted to standard armaments and armor unless the covenant has exceptionally well- or ill-armed guards. Companions are similarly restricted, but their backgrounds are more likely to allow for better equipment.

Magi have special equipment requirements, not only in terms of magical paraphernalia but also their dress, since they can expect fair and respectful treatment even from enemies. Wearing magical symbols on one's cloak will usually advertise a wizard's status, though it also makes it difficult to travel without being noticed. Dressing in finery will afford some respect, but people who do not recognize the danger may still attempt to assault or harass your character. Peasant garb merits no special treatment. Wearing armor is a bad idea—enemies may mistake the character for a warrior and offer challenge.

Magi begin the game with the laboratory equipment stipulated by their covenant and with any sort of garb that they wish. They may also choose standard weaponry (or better, depending on the covenant's resources) if they are skilled in its use.

Use your common sense in picking out mundane belongings for your character. Take into account such things as your character's background and means. When you have assembled a list, present it to your storyguide for approval.

# Encumbrance

Encumbrance is a measure of how loaded down a character is. Its score acts as a penalty to all rolls that require free, fast movement, including spellcasting and nearly all Quickness rolls.

Your Encumbrance is equal to your Strength + Load. Load is calculated by adding together the Load values of your weapons, armor, and other bulky equipment (and dropping fractions). Note that Load values are negative.

Your Encumbrance score cannot be greater than 0, nor can it be negative if you are carrying no Load, no matter how low your Strength is.

# Calculated Combat Values

If your character is likely to get involved in combat, it would be worth your while to calculate your character's combat values at this stage. Refer to the Combat chapter, specifically "Introduction to Combat Scores," on page 161.

# Moving On

The process of character creation does not end with the beginning of the saga. Your character never stops growing, changing, developing and maturing. As the saga unfolds, think of ways your character's personality has changed or is changing—guide his growth over time. The experience points you earn as time passes will move your character's Abilities to new levels. You can make up new Personality Traits, quirks and history to further define your character's personality and background.

Novelists often speak of characters in their books coming to life, refusing to be manipulated or directed by the writer. They stand out from the page and say, "Leave me alone. I'm real." Then they do exactly as they wish, regardless of the author's original intent. We roleplayers can learn a lot from this experience.
