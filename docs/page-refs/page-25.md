CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
25

# House Merinita

Starting Abilities: Faerie Lore 1, Faerie Magic 1 (see below), Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 4, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 13 + age

The involvement of followers of Merinita with the faerie world gives them a deep affinity with unearthly forms of magic.

## Required Virtue:

Faerie Magic (+1): This allows you to have a unique Arcane Talent, Faerie Magic, which you purchase along with your other Abilities and improve with experience points. Add your score in this Ability to rolls resisting faerie magic and to rolls when casting faerie magic spells that you learn or invent. The higher your score in this Ability, though, the more strange and like the fey you become.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Faerie Blood (variable): An ancestor was one of the Good Folk; this may be the source not only of your Gift, but also your fascination with all things faerie. See page 39.

Magical Animal Companion (+2): Your master took you on journeys through faerie lands, and on one of these visits you befriended a supernatural creature of some type. To turn it into a Familiar would be to deprive it of some of its freedom, so you might not wish to do so. See page 44.

Cursed (variable): Encounters with dark or exceptionally powerfully faeries may have left you with unfortunate defects. See page 46.

Clumsy Magic (−2): Faerie influence has made your magic a bit more difficult to control than is normal. See page 36.

# House Quaesitoris

Starting Abilities: Hermetic Law 2, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 5 + age

As enforcers of the laws that bind the Order, quaesitores bear a heavy responsibility. This is both an honor and a burden, and the Virtues and Flaws of this House tend to reflect this.

## Required Virtue:

Quaesitor (+1): Out of deference to your position, you are respected by other members of the Order—although not necessarily liked. See page 34.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Affinity with Divination Magic (variable): The nature of your specialty could be as broad as a magical Art (such as Intéllego) or a specific area (such as seeing the past). See page 34.

Clear Thinker (+1): The duties of a quaesitor demand rigorous mental training. See page 41.

Higher Purpose (+1): Guiding the Order in following its Code is an important cause to you and gives you strength in hard times. See page 41.

Dutybound (−1): Your devotion to your calling can verge on the fanatical. See page 47.

# House Tremere

Starting Abilities: Certámen 2, Intrigue 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes 2), Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 4 + age

House Tremere is founded on order, pure and uncompromising. This has its benefits, for it encourages logic and careful planning. On the other hand, it also stifles individuality and promotes a certain rigidity of thought.

## Required Flaw:

No Sigil (−1): Your sigil (the symbol of your membership in the Order of Hermes) is held by your parens. You cannot vote at tribunal, and the holder of your sigil can call on you to perform tasks or missions. Any filii you have do not hold their sigils until you possess your own. You must defeat the holder of your sigil in certámen to claim your right.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Self-Confident (variable): You have been taught that you are superior to the vast majority of humanity and that House Tremere is superior to the other Houses of Hermes. See page 42.

Strong-Willed (+1): The motto of House Tremere is “Will conquers all.” See page 42.

Knack with Certámen: This represents the special techniques you have learned and the early practice you received. See page 40.
