CHAPTER XII

BESTIARY

# Tazzelrik, a Lowly Fiend

Tazzelrik is a freakish demon of quite monstrous appearance. Standing as tall as a man, he has a cow's head; green, shaggy hair and hide; and the legs of a large human—but no torso! He walks with a shambling gait, but is well balanced, and hops around very quickly when trying to avoid detection.

This bestial fiend is more cowardly than brave, but malice is nonetheless evident in his actions. He is nourished by peasants' bad tempers and ill will toward their neighbors. His favorite scheme is to spy on a communal field for a while until he learns of a peasant whose fields are reached by crossing those of another. Tazzelrik then stomps all over the neighboring peasant's crops in the wake of the first. There's bound to be a confrontation, and Tazzelrik's demonic gluttony is temporarily sated.

Adventure Seed: The characters come across two peasants arguing in a field, victims of Tazzelrik's mischief. A perceptive group member hears maniacal laughter and sees a green cow's head hopping through the tall wheat. A grand chase through the farmland ensues, ending perhaps in a group dance, courtesy of Tazzelrik's malefic power.

The Jump Conjoined, ReCo 15, 2 points: When Tazzelrick hops up and down, all who watch him must make Stamina stress rolls of  $6+$  or begin to hop along with him and take no other actions. Stress rolls of  $9+$  may be made each round to break free. This effect lasts as long as there are victims, or until Tazzelrick stops hopping.

# Harkerr, a Senior Pit-Snake Demon

A simple-minded demon who has not yet learned to replace his lust for brutality with subtlety and subterfuge, Harkerr is normally employed as a taskmaster for the other pit-snake demons. He is a "torturer of torturers," who must keep his slaves busy tormenting the many souls that his mas

ter has seen fit to put under his supervision. Because of his wonderful capacity for inflicting pain and death, Harkerr is a favored subject of diabolic summoning, and for this reason occasionally appears in the mortal world.

Harkerr appears as a husky man from the waist up, and as a gray-green snake from the waist down. He carries a whip in his left hand and a shield, bound with human leather, in his right. He must strike with his whip to use any of his powers. However, Infernal Might points are spent before rolling to hit, so even on a miss, Harkerr is weakened. He is among the class of warrior demons, and as such only appears in physical form.

Adventure Seed: The characters discover evidence of diabolism near the covenant, and begin to uncover a horrendous plot. When they get too close, Harkerr is summoned in a grand ceremony and sent to destroy them.
