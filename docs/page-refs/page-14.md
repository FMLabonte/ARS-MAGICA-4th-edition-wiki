ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

performing some action, and the Form as a noun, the item which the action is performed upon.

The intensity of a spell's effect is measured by its level, typically a number from 5 to 40, though magi themselves never use this term. They speak of the magnitude of a spell, which in game terms is the level divided by five.

Spellcasting takes three basic forms. Formulaic spells are those that have been recorded and can be learned by anyone, provided a teacher or reference material is available. Ritual spells are carefully planned ceremonies that may take hours to complete, but whose effects can be very long-lasting; they are a subset of formulaic spells. Spontaneous spells are created "off the cuff" by combining Forms and Techniques. Spontaneous spells are generally not as powerful as Formulaic spells, but since they can be created on the fly, they are far more flexible in application.

Whenever a magus casts a spell, a unique manifestation of his or her magic is produced as a side effect. This is the wizard's sigil, and might be a color, an odor, or some other minor effect. This should not be confused with the sigil, a symbol of a magus's membership in the Order of Hermes that confers the right to vote at tribunals.

Magi can create new formulaic spells, study the nature of magic, and create enchanted objects in the laboratory. Such studies are time-consuming, and the amounts of time spent in given tasks is generally measured in seasons.

# Getting Hurt and Dealing Damage

Mythic Europe is a dangerous place, and magic is far from a precise art. Casting spells under stressful circumstances, or exerting oneself physically, is tiring. A character starts with a number of Fatigue levels, which are marked off progressively as the character becomes more and more fatigued.

Body levels show how badly hurt a character is, and are recorded in a similar manner to Fatigue levels. A character who is taking physical damage often has a chance to Soak, reducing the amount of injury that is actually caused.

Combat is a relatively common occurrence in Mythic Europe. There are a number of combat totals that each character has, which quantify how successful the character will be at various combat endeavors. These totals include Initiative, Attack, Defense, Damage, Soak, and Fatigue.

# The Use of Latin

Latin was the language of Western scholarship in the Middle Ages, and anyone who wanted to be thought "civilized" had to know it. The Order of Hermes grew from a Roman tradition, and so Latin is used frequently in magical terminology.

We have used Latin to add flavor to the game setting (for example, the names of the magical Arts are Latin). The Latin terms used are readily understandable, and are explained in the text where they first appear.

# Mechanics and Dice Rolling

In Ars Magica, each character has a set of Characteristics, which determine his innate ability in several areas, and a set of Abilities, which quantify his learned and practiced skills. Usually, a score in one Characteristic is added to a score in one Ability to determine how well the character performs a given task. For example, a character attempting to recall an important fact about dragons would add his score in Intelligence (a Characteristic) and his score in Legend Lore (an Ability) to generate a total that will indicate how well he can perform the remembering task.

In most cases where characters are tested, outcomes are uncertain. The success or failure of such actions is simulated through a die roll, made at the direction of the storyguide. All die rolls in Ars Magica are made on ten-sided dice. These are marked with the numbers 0 through 9, and are available at most game and hobby stores. There are three different ways that the ten-sided die can be used in Ars Magica, and the method depends on the situation. Usually the rules will tell you which way to use the dice, but sometimes the storyguide must make the decision.

A simple die is rolled in a situation when the variability of possible results is low and there is little likelihood of spectacular success or failure. Read the number as rolled; a 0 counts as 10.

A quality die is useful in situations where there is a chance of extraordinary success, but no risk of devastating failure. Read the number as rolled; a 0 counts as 10. If the result is 1, you may roll the die again, doubling whatever number comes up. If a second 1 comes up, reroll and quadruple the next number; a third 1 means multiply the result by 8; and so on.

A stress die is rolled when a character is in a critical situation. People under stress are scared and therefore give it all they've got. They are capable of extraordinary feats but can also make disastrous mistakes. Stress rolls can also be called for in situations where there is a chance of great success or abysmal failure, even if the situation is not particularly stressful. If you roll a 1 on a stress die you may roll the
