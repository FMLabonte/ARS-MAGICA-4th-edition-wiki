ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Incomprehensible: You have an eccentric understanding of magic which you are almost completely unable to describe. Your rolls are at –3 when discussing or writing about magic (assuming that you are trying to communicate clearly).

Infamous Master: Your master was a diabolist, bumbler, fool, widely despised, or held in contempt for some other reason. Most magi expect little better from you. Even if you've done nothing wrong, you are treated as though you don't deserve to be a member of the Order. You have a bad Reputation of the appropriate type at level 3 among magi.

Loose Magic: You lack the concentration, will, or ability to Master spells.

Necessary Condition: In order for your magic to work, you must perform a specific action while casting any spell. This should be something simple, such as singing or spinning around three times.

No Familiar (Bjornaer Only): Because of a flaw in your magic or nature, it is impossible for you to create the mystic cords that bind you to a familiar. Magi of houses other than Bjornaer may take this Flaw with the permission of the Storyguide.

No Sigil (Tremere Only): See page 25.

Poor Reader: You don't like to read, and don't read very well. When studying Arts or Knowledges from a book, treat the book as if its Quality were two levels lower.

Poor Student: You don't understand what others teach you very well. You get a –6 penalty to Lab Totals when learning spells or when working from the lab texts of others.

Tormenting Master: Your master does not believe you have successfully passed the apprentice's gauntlet (the test of becoming a magus). He periodically troubles you with political moves and indirect attacks.

Twilight Points: During apprenticeship you suffered an encounter with wild, strong magic that sent you into Wizard's Twilight (see page 182). The nature of the experience is important, as any future Twilight episodes will likely be related to the first. Consult with the storyguide to determine the exact nature and effect of the experience—both the number of Twilight points you have sustained as well as any effects you suffered. As this is a Flaw, good effects should not be generated from the Twilight encounter.

Unimaginative Learner: You have trouble figuring things out for yourself. Subtract one from rolls when you study from raw vis (before multiplication).

Vis Obligation: You must pay someone four pawns of vis a year, independent of any other obligation your covenant may have. Failing to pay your debt may lead to very serious consequences, such as Hermetic punishment. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Flaw based on the availability of vis in the Saga.

Warped Magic: Your magic is accompanied by some unpleasant side effect that always manifests itself the same way, but with increasing intensity according to the level of the spell. Examples include nearby items become hot or nearby plant matter becomes shriveled and wilted. This effect may cause trouble from time to time, but is usually just annoying.

Weak Writer: You write about magic slowly and methodically. You copy spells from your shorthand at (Scribe Latin x 10) levels per season, and copy (Scribe Latin x 30) levels of spells that have already been written out per season. You may only write summa up to one-third of your level in an Art of Knowledge, and write two levels less per season than normal. You copy summae at (Scribe + Dexterity) x 2 levels per season.

-2 Flaws

Clumsy Magic: You have trouble targeting your spells accurately. Any spell that requires a targeting roll to aim its effect is subject to disastrous failure: a roll of 0 is automatically a botch. You receive a –3 penalty to any rolls involving Finesse.

Discredited Lineage: The quaesitores suspect your Hermetic line of some terrible crime such as diabolism or descent from House Diedne, and it's unlikely that your name will ever be cleared. They keep a close eye on everything you do or say. If wrongdoing takes place, you are the first they suspect. Should you ever be formally accused, people are likely to shoot first and ask questions later. The quaesitores also try very hard to keep members of your line from positions of authority. You have a bad Reputation of an appropriate type, level 4, among quaesitores.

Lack Of Concentration: You are profoundly unable to focus your mind. You cannot possess the Concentration Ability and cannot cast ritual spells.

Lack Of Control: After casting a spell, you must spend a round doing nothing but recovering your mental faculties.

Limited Magic Resistance: You are less able to resist magic than other magi. You gain no bonus from your Form scores to magic resistance rolls, though if you are caught without your Parma Magica, you retain a magic resistance of 0. You are still entitled to a natural resistance roll if it is applicable to the spell.

Rigid Magic: You cannot use vis when you cast spells. Thus, you cannot extend the duration or range of spells, increase your spell rolls, cast ritual magic, or create permanent effects. You can use vis in the laboratory.

Short-Lived Magic: Your spells do not last as long as they should. Spells that should be permanent last a year; those of a year, a moon; those of a moon, only to the next sunrise or sundown; and those of a sun, merely Diameter. Diameter, Concentration, and Instant spells are not affected, nor are those whose duration is enhanced by vis.

Slow Caster: Your magic requires more time to prepare and execute than that of other magi. Your formulaic spells take two rounds to cast; spontaneous spells also take two rounds unless you fast-cast. Ritual spells are performed as normal, since all magi must cast them slowly and carefully.

Stingy Master: Your master trained you less thoroughly than most, so you have only 130 points to buy spells and 130 points to purchase Arts instead of the usual 150 for each.

Weak Magic: You are particularly unskilled with a certain Art, making it difficult for you to overcome the natural and magic resistance of targets. When determining Penetration with that Art, halve your spellcasting roll. In addition, the target's Natural Resistance roll is at +3. The storyguide may disallow this Virtue for some Arts that rarely require penetration, or rarely call for natural resistance.

-3 Flaws

Magic Addiction: You crave the rush of casting and holding power over magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you have a difficult time stopping yourself from casting again and again until you drop from exhaustion. Whenever you use a stress die in spellcasting, you must, whether or not the spell succeeds, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll, against a target number of half the level of the spell (or, if you botched, the level you were attempting). If you fail, you must immediately either cast a Formulaic spell of at least the same level as the previous spell, or cast any spontaneous spell, expending
