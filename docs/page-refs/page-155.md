other spells, and modify or change their effects. Such Vim spells have no spell foci.

Vim magic also encompasses dealing with demons. Summoning and dealing with demons is prohibited within the Order, but fighting them is allowed.

Magi often use Vim to counteract magical phenomena. Storyguides should assign spell levels for all magical phenomena that those using Vim counterspells will have to match.

Most Vim spells are of General level, because the magic that Vim spells affect varies widely in power. A spell to dispel a first magnitude spell needs to be much less powerful than a similar spell to dispel a fifth magnitude effect. The guidelines provided for Vim spells take account of this, and rather than giving an absolute level for a corresponding effect, they give the relationship that the level of the Vim spell must bear to the level of the target. Thus, the guideline for creating a ward against demons states that the level of the ward plus a quality die minus 5 must exceed the Might of the demon.

As usual, these guidelines refer to a spell with the basic range, duration and target. When changing these parameters the change in level should be taken account of before multiplying or dividing the spell level to get the effect. Thus, a version of Wind of Mundane Silence (PeVi) with Far range would dispel a spell cast with a Technique + Form total of less than half (spell level - 10). Ten levels of the spell's power are devoted to increasing the range, and only the remaining power is available for the effect.

The Individual target for a Vim spell can refer to either an individual spell, or an individual object or person, and similarly for Group. If the target is an object or person, the Vim spell will affect any suitable magic affecting that person, not just one spell. Most such spells can only be cast on either other spells or individuals, but, if the description suggests that they could be cast on either, then they can. For example, Mirror of Opposition can only be cast on other spells, while The Invisible Eye Revealed can only be cast on people or objects.

The guidelines below refer mainly to spells. This is for the sake of brevity, as Vim spells can affect magical effects proceeding from magical items, magical creatures, or demons. However, unless specifically stated otherwise, the spells do not affect magical items, only the effects that they produce. Thus, Wind of Mundane Silence could dispel a stone wall produced by a magical item, but Disenchant is needed to dispel the magic of the item itself.

It should be noted that Hermetic magi, and some non-Hermetic wizards, do not have Might scores, and thus are not affected by wardings or other spells that act against Might scores.

## Creo Vim Guidelines

There are few Creo Vim spells known throughout the Order. The basic range is Touch, the basic duration is Sun, which usually boosts to Permanent, and the basic target is Individual.

Gen: Create a magical shell which looks real to Intéllego spells with penetration less than twice its level (this aura is generic 'magic' only—no misleading information can be supplied). Create a magical shell which prevents Intéllego spells with penetration less than its level from learning any details about the magic on the target. Create a magical shell which gives false information about the target to Intéllego spells with penetration less than half its level.

## Creo Vim Spells

### General

#### Shell of False Determinations

R: Touch, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Creates a "shell" of magic on an item, helping to shield it from investigation by other magi. All attempts to investigate the magic item give false information about its powers unless half of the level of the shell is exceeded by the magus's Investigation roll. The duration is higher than normal because this is a Ritual, and thus is always boosted with vis.

#### Shell of Opaque Mysteries

R: Touch, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

This spell is similar to Shell of False Determinations (above), but it causes all attempts to investigate the magic item to utterly fail, unless the level of the ritual is exceeded by the magus's Investigation roll. Once a magus determines the presence of a particular shell (that is, by overcoming it), it has no more power against him or her.

### Level 15

#### The Phantom Gift

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Perm T: Ind

Spell Focus: Bat Wings (+1)

The target of the spell becomes tainted with magic as most magi are. Beasts and people react to the target as though he were a magus. Those who normally associate with the victim do not become hostile, but do give him or her a wider berth. The spell has no effect on those who already have the Gift, including those blessed with the Gentle Gift.

## Intéllego Vim Guidelines

Since magic is a tricky thing to understand, spells that detect magic are at once difficult and important. Although demons deal in Vim, they are made of the essence of deception itself. If a demon does not wish to be detected, it cannot be (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), and for this reason there are no demon-locating magics. Magic items cannot be investigated with simple magic spells. Investigation requires that you spend at least one season in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains (see the Laboratory chapter). A spell will suffice to tell you that an item is magical, however, and may give you some idea of its powers. Spells will never tell you how to use an item.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

A first magnitude Intéllego Vim spell will detect magical effects of tenth magnitude or higher. For every magnitude by which the detecting spell is increased, decrease the minimum spell to be detected by two magnitudes. Thus, a sixth magnitude spell will detect "zero magnitude" effects: the traces of powerful magic, or the recent presence of weak magic. Further increases in level will give increased sensitivity to residues. This level of spell also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of the magic (within a magnitude). The addition of one mag-
