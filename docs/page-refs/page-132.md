ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Requisite: Terram

Makes any plant, dead or alive, as hard as iron. Affects any amount of continuous plant material up to the size of a small tree or a small glade of grass. Sharp-edged plants can become deadly when they are made this hard. If a bit of iron is available, it is touched to the plant, bringing about the transformation.

## Level 20

### Twist the Living Tree

R: Touch/Far, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Pearl (+3)

You make a living tree bend into unusual positions. Depending on your needs, you can make a cage, a shelter, or a wall. Even the leaves can be commanded, maybe to form a solid roof that sheds rain. Takes one to ten minutes to complete (depending on the complexity of the new shape), during which time you must maintain concentration.

## Level 25

### Piercing Shaft of Wood

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind

Aimed: +2

Spell Focus: An Arrow Shaft (+1)

Requisite: Rego

Turns a piece of wood into a sleek, barbed, strong shaft that flies through the air at a target. Damage depends on the size of the item from which the shaft is formed: staff (upper size limit) +10, 2-foot branch +8, wand +5. If it pierces a body, removing the shaft causes the target to automatically lose a Body level, unless a Stamina stress roll of 6+ is made (add the Chirurgy score of the one who removes the shaft).

### Stir the Slumbering Tree

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+1)

Requisite: Mentem

Raises any tree into a state of consciousness resembling that of a humans. Such a tree can see and hear what is going on around it, and at a normal human level of perception. Such a tree may share some mental attributes or personality traits with the caster. The tree can rearrange its branches over the course of several hours, though too slowly for people to observe the movement from second to second. Most trees in magical areas are already awake. The star ruby is a gem that may be used for conjuring and controlling occult entities.

## Level 55

### Curse of the Haunted Forest

R: Per, D: Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Requisite: Perdo

Turns a previously normal forest into a haunted and dangerous place. The trees become gnarled and hideous, and the imaginative can see menacing faces in them. The trees also become conscious and cruel; capable of sight, hearing, and limited movement. While they cannot uproot themselves, they can move their branches about, and

can reach the ground in an hour or two. Only ill-tempered animals, such as boars and crows, live in these woods, and nothing in them is edible. The only knowledge of what might happen should this ritual be attempted in a faerie forest comes from ancient and disputed legends of the Order of Hermes.

## Perdo Herbam Guidelines

These spells destroy plants and plant material. Since many items are made of wood, these spells can be quite destructive. The guidelines given are for destroying dead wood. Destroying live wood is usually a bit harder—add one level of magnitude.

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Instant, and basic target is Small.

Level 4: Spoil an amount of food.

Level 5: Destroy an amount of dead wood. Cause the leaves to fall off of a plant.

Level 10: Destroy a plant.

## Perdo Herbam Spells

## Level 5

### Curse of the Rotted Wood

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Sawdust (+3)

Causes a non-living wooden object to rot and fall apart. Objects up to the size of a single door can be affected, but things that size take up to two rounds to decay. Usually, large chunks of wood start falling off the target, and slowly crumble to smaller and smaller pieces, until only dust is left.

Ferramentum of Verditius's version of this spell is very orderly as per his wizard's sigil. The decay of the object starts from the top and continues to the bottom, leaving only dust as it goes.

## Level 15

### Wizard's Autumn

R: Per/Sight, D: Inst, T: Bound

Spell Focus: A Handful of Snow (+3)

Causes all the deciduous leaves (that is, those that normally fall in autumn) to turn brown and then fall to the ground. The full process takes a minute. The trees do not bud again until the next spring.

## Level 20

### Plant's Withering Bane

R: Near/Far, D: Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Leaf of Angelica (+1)

Withers and destroys one living tree, which may not be more than twice as tall as a man. The spell may also affect all small, living
