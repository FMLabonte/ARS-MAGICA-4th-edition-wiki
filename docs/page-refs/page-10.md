THE ART OF MAGIC

prisoners. Still the faerie minstrel seemed clearly better, and the faerie lord was grinning.

Then the music changed. Jocelin was improvising, and changing the story. The newcomer spoke to the imprisoned knights of their homes and families, left behind desolate, and of the glory to be won on the battlefield, not in this cave. He spoke to them of the shame of being held in thrall by a woman, and roused them to action. As the knights rose to their feet and girded on their arms, preparing to leave, the faerie minstrel began to falter, losing time with Jocelin, the notes clashing. As they turned on their captor, who revealed herself as a fiend with golden claws dripping ink, which scored wounds on the heart, and a voice that pierced the ears with poetry, the faerie minstrel was reduced to singing fragments, off key, and often mistakenly continuing the story. As the faerie was defeated and the knights rode to freedom, he dropped out completely.

The face of the faerie lord was like thunder, and darkness swirled within his throne.

“You have won, mortal. Leave the forest, if you can.”

“My lord, I was only to serve you if I lost.” The faerie’s face twisted for a moment, then he relaxed.

“True. You may leave. Your companions, however, were no part of our bargain.” Jocelin turned to look at us, stricken, and I felt little better. My mistress, however, was undisturbed. She gathered us close to her, and bowed to the faerie lord. I could see the shadows taking shape around us, warriors with cruel, dark blades. Then she held up a piece of wood from our chambers in Cambridge, and began chanting. The faerie lord screamed with rage, even as he vanished from our sight, and we found ourselves back in Cambridge.

We spent two days in the faerie forest, it seems, but Schola Pythagoranis are happy, and my mistress has their support. And I have heard Jocelin sing.

Twelfth day of Capricorn, thirteen hundred and forty-eighth year of Aries.

I dislike traveling in winter. We have come to Norwich to meet with a lord. My mistress has told me not to write down his name, for his protection. I suspect that ours may also be involved: the Quaesitores might be inclined to take a dim view of such goings on. My mistress needs a public sponsor for her religious order, and this lord is likely to be it.

This is a great city, not quite so large as London, but large nonetheless. From the towers of the castle keep, it is all spread out below you, the great cathedral dominating, and the dozens of smaller churches pushing their towers up beyond the level of the houses. It is strange, all these

churches and no service, as the interdict continues. Kirst has spoken of the possibility that the Dominion will fade if it continues, since the power of God will lie less heavily on a land that He has rejected, but I have noticed no fading while I have been here.

As guests of this lord, we were entertained well in the Great Hall, a truly spectacular room. Of course, my mistress’s Great Chamber will be yet finer. Minstrels played, and Jocelin joined them for a while. He really loves these places — I think it has something to do with the servant girls. The food, at any rate, was better than I have eaten in some time. The winter stocks here have hardly been touched, it seems.

Thirteenth day of Capricorn, thirteen hundred and forty-eighth year of Aries.

My mistress spent today closeted with the lord, negotiating for his support. I was employed as a valet, bringing food and drink so that none of the lord’s servants need know what was going on. He spoke of the possibility of magical assistance against the Pope, in Ireland, or against the King of France. Of course, my mistress had to refuse. She can hardly break the Code that blatantly in order to build a meeting place for the Tribunal.

The talk turned to more personal things: long life, protection from his enemies, and such like. I was sent from the chamber at that point, ostensibly to fetch wine. Since the agreement had been concluded by the time I returned, however, I suspect that the real reason was to prevent me from learning what the terms were. My mistress seemed happy, however.

Twenty first day of Sagittarius, thirteen hundred and forty-ninth year of Aries.

My mistress has just spent three seasons solidly training me, and now she has told me to amuse myself for a while. I think she must be working on her side of the bargain with the lord. I have convinced Jocelin to take me to York, as the council will not give me access to the library. It is time to become a monk again for a while.

Eighteenth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and fifty first year of Aries.

Another journey in search of support, this time to the other side of the country, amid the mountains and lakes looking across the sea to Ireland. Ungulus is an old covenant, housed in a great tower, raised by magic from the mountain on which it stands. The outside is covered by intricate carvings which no human being has ever puzzled
