## Generating Characteristics

There are two different methods you can use to generate your character's Characteristics. If your storyguide allows it, you may choose between them. The first method allows you to select your Characteristics using point-based purchase system. This allows you to stick closely to your concept. Alternatively, you may use a random method for generating your Characteristics, rolling dice to determine their values. Many players prefer this element of chance in character creation.

## Option 1: Purchase Method

You may spend up to 7 points on positive scores in Characteristics. The cost of a given score is reflected on the Characteristic Cost Table. You will note that buying negative Characteristics yields negative points. Use these to counterbalance the cost of positive Characteristics if you spend more than the seven allotted points.

If you would like to have a Characteristic that is higher than +3 or lower than -3, you should purchase a Characteristic of +3 or -3 now. When you choose Virtues and Flaws you will have the opportunity to increase or decrease your score to a maximum of +5 (or a minimum of -5) only if you already have a +3 or -3.

## Option 2: Random Generation

Random generation produces characters whose Characteristics tend to average to zero, but have the possibility of attaining characteristics of +4 or -4.

You will need two ten-sided dice of different colors. Designate one as the positive die and the other as the negative die. Roll both. If neither die came up 0, subtract the negative die from the positive die, noting the total. For example, if the positive die were a 2 and the negative die a 5, you would record -3. If either die was a 0 (or if both dice turned up the same number), record a 0.

Once you have generated four scores in this way, assign each score to a pair of Characteristics (Int/Per, Str/Sta, Pre/Com, and Dex/Qik). You may then divide that number in any way you choose between the two Characteristics of the pair, provided that you do not assign one to be positive and the other negative or assign any Characteristic a +4 or -4 unless the total was +7, -7, +8, or -8.

## Specialties

After you have generated a score for each Characteristic, assign a specialty to each. A specialty is simply a word that describes each non-zero Characteristic your character has, giving more definition than a statistic like +2 or -1 can. For example, if you have a +1 Strength, is your character "thick," "bulky," or "forceful?" Does your -3 Dexterity indicate that he is "bumbling," or simply "clumsy?" Characteristic specialties help you visualize your character, and other than that, have no mechanical function in the game.

## Virtues And Flaws

Since magi, companions, and grogs are exceptional people, they have many unusual strengths and weaknesses. Normal people, on the other hand, may have only one of each, or none at all. Properly selecting a range of interesting features is central to developing your character concept, so think carefully about your decisions.

Virtues are exceptional attributes that confer a benefit; Flaws are attributes that hinder or limit characters. Once play begins, they cannot change unless the storyguide decides that drastic story events warrant some sort of modification. Virtues are each assigned a positive value, and

|  Maximum Virtues and Flaws  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Grog | +3/-3  |
|  Companion | +10/-10  |
|  Magi | +10/-10  |
