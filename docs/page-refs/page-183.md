# Temporary Twilight

When a magus with Twilight points encounters a powerful, uncontrollable magical force, he may enter temporary Twilight. As a rule of thumb, this can happen on multiple botches when casting spells or when studying raw vis in the laboratory. However, any exposure to powerful, wild magic can precipitate the episode. Follow the steps below to see whether a magus suffers Twilight.

1. Check for Twilight: Make a stress roll and add the character's Twilight points. Add the character's score in Enigmatic Wisdom, if he has that Ability. If the total is 24+, a temporary Twilight episode occurs; otherwise, there is no unusual effect. The character still suffers the effects of the botch, though, if that is what precipitated the roll for Twilight.

2. Roll for Twilight points gained: If the character enters temporary Twilight, make a simple roll. Subtract the character's Enigmatic Wisdom, and add the result to the Twilight point total. You always add at least 1. If the character's score is now 24 or more, the character enters final Twilight. Otherwise, the character has a chance to control the Twilight episode.

3. Roll for Twilight control: The player makes an Intelligence stress roll for the character. Add +3 for the Virtue Strong-Willed, and add the character's Enigmatic Wisdom score if he has that skill. The storyguide rolls a simple die and adds the aura rating of any supernatural realm that dominates the area to represent the intensity of the Twilight. Other bonuses can apply if the circumstances warrant a more intense Twilight (such as a quadruple spell botch).

If the player rolls higher, the character has enough control over the experience to avoid dangers and to learn something—roll for a good effect on the table above. If the storyguide's is the higher roll, the Twilight is overwhelming—roll for a bad effect.

These rolls can also be used as guidelines for deciding how long the Twilight lasts and for how much control the magus retains over his body. There is, however, no observable correlation between internal (psychic) and external (bodily) control.

# Good Effects

Increased understanding: Normally a magus can only write a summa that describes an Art up to half his score. This effect allows the magus to understand his highest Art more clearly, granting the ability to write up to two-thirds of its score (rounded down). The next occurrence of this effect raises the maximum to three-quarters; then five-sixths; and finally, the total Art score. The great magical tomes of the Order have almost all been written by magi who have undergone Twilight and have brought back insights to share with the rest.

Experience points in Affinity: Roll a simple die and add the result in experience points to an Affinity possessed by the character (see page 34). A magus with no Affinity or with one opposed to the circumstances of the Twilight may gain a new one. In that case, halve the result of the roll (round down) for the number of points used to purchase the new Affinity.

Experience points in Arcane Ability: Make a simple roll and apply that many experience points to an Arcane Ability. The Ability should suit the nature of the Twilight experience.

Experience points in Magic Theory: Make a simple roll and add that many experience points to the character's Magic Theory.

Increase in Art: Roll a simple die and multiply the result by three. Treat this as the study total of a summa studied for a season (see "Reading Summa" on page 188). The Art raised depends on the circumstances of the Twilight and on the personal specialty of the magus. Its score increases by at least one point in any event.

Special: This produces an effect that the storyguide deems appropriate. Anything relevant to the circumstances can happen. The magus might gain a minor magical ability, or improve one already possessed.
