CHAPTER V
SPELLS
109

spell continues to function. This can be quite a problem with larger animals.

The Sphinx is a fantastic beast alleged to be of great intelligence, and thus its tail is thought to bring wisdom to the bearer.

## Level 30

### Hunter's Sense

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun/Moon, T: Spec

Spell Focus: The Eye of a Griffin (+3)

You sense the shapes and motivations of all animals above a certain size that come within 15 paces of you. You decide the size threshold when you cast the spell, such as "all animals larger than a fox." If you're asleep, you see the animal in a dream, but that might not awaken you. If the spell is cast with the eye of a griffin, the eye must be kept with you for the duration of the spell.

## Muto Animál Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, basic target is Individual. Animals granted new abilities, such as wings, will need a few minutes to get used to them. When transforming things, you can transform things that they are carrying with appropriate requisites. For example, you could transform a horse and its armor with a Terram requisite.

Animals are not infinitely mutable, and using too many of these spells for too long on an animal can warp its natural constitution and even destroy it. Muto Corpus spells may be examined to get additional ideas and guidelines for Muto Animál Spells. Common sigils seen in Muto Animál spells involve animals being changed in some strange way. Beasts transformed by Julian of Flambeau, with The Beast Remade (MuAn 25), might have bright red hair in their new form, while toads created by Silva of Merinita, with Transformation of the Ravenous Beast to the Torpid Toad (MuAn 30), might have a comical coloration.

**Level 3**: Make a superficial change to something made of animal products (like changing its color).

**Level 5**: Make a major change to something made of animal products that preserves the substance (for example, turn a leather jerkin into a saddle). Gradually turn meat into vermin. Make a superficial change to a beast.

**Level 10**: Change an animal's limb.

**Level 15**: Make a major change in a beast, while leaving it recognizably the same sort of animal (for example, make a horse bigger and change its color).

**Level 20**: Change an animal into a different animal. Change an animal in a minor way so that it is no longer natural (for example, change the color of a horse's coat to match the covenant's coat of arms).

**Level 25**: Change an animal into a human (though it retains its animal mentality and does not gain a soul). Change an animal into a plant (requires an Herbam requisite).

**Level 30**: Change an animal in a major unnatural way (for example, give a horse claws, fangs, and scaly armored skin). Change an animal into a non-living item (appropriate requisite required).

**Level 40**: Radically change an animal in an unnatural way (for example, give a horse wings). Give an animal a 'magical' ability, such as the ability to breathe fire (requires a requisite for the ability).

## Muto Animál Spells

## Level 15

### Beast of Outlandish Size

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Giant's Heart (+5)

Changes the Size of an animal by +1 or down to -2. If the beast grows, this change modifies Damage by +2, Soak by +1, and Defense by -1, and adds one Body level. If the beast shrinks, reverse the signs of these modifiers and apply them for each point of Size decrease. If enlarged, the new beast is of huge size, and looks much more impressive than its former self. Townspeople may run in fear of it, and there is little doubt among them that it is a creature of magic. If shrunk, the beast appears to be little more than a runt, unfit to live.

### Growth of the Creeping Things

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Basil Sprig (+3)

Causes an insect, mouse, toad, or other small (Size -5) creature to grow to four times its normal size. If it was poisonous before, it is even more poisonous now. Semi-poisonous creatures, like most spiders, do +8 points of poison damage in larger form.

### The Immaculate Beast

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Topaz (+3)

Transforms an animal into a flawless specimen of its type, enhancing its outstanding features and giving it +3 on rolls related to its strongest feature. It improves a hawk's vision, a racehorse's speed, or a draft horse's strength, for example. The topaz, which may be used with this spell, is associated with the lion, and thus the beast in question is given the best of the animal kingdom's qualities.

## Level 25

### The Beast Remade

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Shapeshifter's Heart (+3)

Requisite: Corpus

Gives one land beast a human form, though its intellect remains the same. Some feature of the animal is retained in the human form. A former dog might have an exceptionally hairy human body, and a former cat might let loose an occasional "meow." Once transformed, the beast is disoriented for a while before it becomes used to its new body.
