Combat Fatigue: When your character exerts himself in combat or any other strenuous activity, there is the risk of exhaustion. Practice and training in an activity improve chances to perform that task longer, while less freedom of movement and heavy equipment lower them.

$$
\mathbf{F_{AT}} = \mathbf{STM} + \mathbf{WEAPON\ SKILL} + \mathbf{ENC}
$$

Encumbrance: Your encumbrance is a measure of how much the equipment you carry hinders your movement. Encumbrance cannot be greater than zero. Note that Loads are negative numbers. See "Encumbrance" on page 63 in the Character Creation chapter for more information.

$$
\mathrm{ENC} = \mathrm{STR} + \mathrm{LOAD}

# Introduction to Combat Ranges

Range is the distance between two combatants (or between any two characters or objects). The ranges used in combat correspond to like-named ranges used in spell descriptions, which are discussed as they apply to spells on page 103. Range is very important in combat, because the range between two combatants determines what sorts of weapons each can use. Longshafted weapons become unwieldy at brawling range, and using a mace against an archer at fifty paces is futile.

Touch: Combatants in Touch range are either in actual physical contact or within reach of a swung fist. In general, the maximum extent of this range is one pace.

Reach: Combatants in Reach range are out of reach of an arm, but within two swords' length. Reach includes the distance between one and two paces, varying somewhat depending on the space required for each combatant to swing his weapons.

Close: Close combatants are outside of sword's reach of each other, but are within a spear's length. This range, which is the maximum for hand to hand combat, starts at two paces distance between combatants and extends up to four paces. Note that Close range does not correspond directly to any spell range.

Near: Near Combatants are outside of Close range, but are within 15 paces of each other.

Middle: Combatants in Middle range of each other are outside Near range, but are within 50 paces of one another. Note that Middle range does not correspond directly to any spell range.

Far: Far range includes the distance outside Middle range up to about 200 paces.

# Combat Sequence

Time in combat is measured in rounds. A combat round is about enough time for each character to perform one quick action—an attempt to dash to another part of the battle, swing a sword through a practiced series of related swings, or incant a magic formula—enough time to do something interesting. The amount of time that passes during a round varies between 5 and 20 seconds depending on the activities being performed.

There are six phases to each combat round, each of which resolves in turn a different sort of action. These phas
