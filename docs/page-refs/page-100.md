THE ART OF MAGIC

# The Participation of Other Players

The storyguide plays an important role in the creation of your familiar. If your troupe has someone who acts as storyguide for laboratory activities, that person may act as storyguide while you are creating your familiar. However, you may wish to use the whole troupe as the acting storyguide during this process, both to get more creative input and to make the familiar more acceptable to your fellow players, who may find it a challenge to deal with such a strange addition to the company.

Because you and your familiar are so close, you may role-play your familiar as an extension of your character. After all, you may have similar abilities and personality quirks. However, you may also have the storyguide or another player act as your familiar. This alternative assures that your familiar is at least distinct from you, and is advised if you and your familiar don't get along very well, such as might be the case with the Bond Quality “At Odds.”

# Apprentices

In your pursuit of the art of magic, you are likely to want an apprentice. Though the Code of Hermes requires that you devote a season a year to teaching your apprentice

rather than doing research, the apprentice in turn is required to help you do your lab work. In addition, an apprentice provides you close human companionship and the chance to leave a living legacy when you die. Your apprentice will likely be the closest thing to a son or daughter that you, as a magus, will ever have.

# Minimum Competence to Teach an Apprentice

You may only have an apprentice if you are competent enough to teach someone every magical Art. Without a score of at least 5 in each of the Arts, you are not familiar enough yourself with the Arts to initiate someone else in their use.

# Finding Your Apprentice

Once you determine that you qualify to teach an apprentice, the next step is to find one. Among the common people there sometimes appear rare individuals with the Gift—those who have innate magical power. Only these individuals can become apprentices and eventually magi. Luckily for those magi who seek them, these people inevitably stand out from the crowd. They are almost invariably intelligent and curious, causing them to fit in poorly with the mass of ignorant, superstitious society. Also, most potential apprentices somehow attract supernatural attention to themselves. In many populations there is a youth who is prone to wandering alone at night, who is the subject of much town gossip, and who displays a precocious wit. Chances are that such a person is a potential apprentice.

Searching for an apprentice can lead to good storytelling and roleplaying possibilities, especially if the search is complicated by enemy forces or uncooperative members of the child's family. However, if you do not wish to make a story out of finding an apprentice, you may determine the results of the search with a die roll. For every season you spend searching for a potential apprentice, make a stress die and add your Perception. If the result is 6+, you find one. If you botch, you may think you've found a child fit to be an apprentice but are somehow duped, either by the child or by some power that replaces your child with its servant.

Your student should be between eight and seventeen years old at the beginning of apprenticeship (if you wish, roll a simple die + 7). Children younger than eight rarely have the discipline required for apprenticeship, and young adults older than seventeen are almost invariably set in their ways
