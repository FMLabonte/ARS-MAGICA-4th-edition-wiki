CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
47

Compulsion: You have an unfortunate urge that causes you problems. Examples include drinking, sex, perfection, bragging, or gambling. You may take this Flaw more than once.

Dark Secret: You are haunted by something that would lead to shame, rejection, and possibly revenge if discovered. Hints about the secret continually arise, and there might be others who know it and could betray you. This makes you avoid certain places, dislike certain people, or fear certain things.

Deep Sleeper: When you sleep, you don't go halfway. You can sleep through loud noises and generally only wake up when shaken, or when good and ready. Even then you suffer -3 on your rolls for half an hour or so after awakening, and you're likely to head back to bed if at all possible.

Delusion: You believe wholeheartedly in something that just isn't so. Examples include that you are a magus (if you are not), that you are the Pope's child, or that your imaginary friend is real. This can cause real problems for you and your associates.

Dependent: You are responsible for someone, like a young child or a decrepit grandparent. This restricts your freedom and time in a variety of ways, which may change with time—a child grows up and moves away, a grandparent gets seriously ill and requires constant care. You may take this Flaw repeatedly to reflect several dependents.

Disfigured: A visible disfigurement makes you ugly and easy to recognize. Presence rolls that involve good looks and gaining respect from most people are at -3. You probably have a cruel nickname that refers to your unfortunate appearance.

Driving Goal: You have some personal objective that you feel compelled to attain, even if it gets you into trouble or jeopardizes the group. Such goals are ideal or open-ended—you can never finally accomplish them. Examples include freeing peasants from oppression, harassing and killing Norman warriors, or amassing vast amounts of personal wealth. You may take this flaw more than once.

Dutybound: You adhere to a restrictive code of conduct that forbids certain behavior, probably including prohibitions against lying, killing prisoners, stealing, and other occasionally useful actions. You follow this code out of guilt or fear rather than high-flown moral standards, and may spend more time justifying yourself than keeping your conduct pure.

Evil Eye: One of your eyes is misshapen, causing your face to have a frightening appearance. People generally regard you as evil, and hide their children's faces from your gaze. You are at a -3 when dealing with mundanes in any social setting, in addition to any penalty you may have for the Gift.

Expenses: You must pay a significant portion of your wealth and income (25% - 50%) to a person or organization, or devote it to expenses that bring you no personal gain. Failure to pay your dues brings unpleasant consequences, such as the loss of privileges or the ill will of an important person.

Faerie Enmity: Faeries dislike you and take every opportunity to pester you. Faerie forests are extremely dangerous, but even field faeries may spoil your food, plague your dreams, or otherwise torment you. Luckily, your life is not in danger—they prefer to let you live so they can continue to harass you.

Favors: You owe a boon to someone (or to a great many people), and may be called upon to return the favor at any time. The consequences of ignoring such a request can range from mild to deadly serious, at the storyguide's discretion.

Fragile Constitution: You are sickly and weak. You suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls to recover from wounds and diseases.

Hatred: You are consumed with hatred for some person who is so powerful that exacting proper vengeance is impractical or impossible. Nevertheless, you constantly pursue opportunities to gain power over or hurt the object of your hatred, so much so that your reason is clouded.

Hunchback (magi): You have a deformed body that gives you a grotesque appearance and hinders your movements. You are at a -3 to all rolls involving agility and balance. Presence rolls that involve good looks are at a -3.

Infamous Family: Your family is very well known, but not very well liked. You have a bad Reputation at level 3 among those who know your family, and have a particularly hard time losing it because it applies to the whole family, not just you. You have trouble trusting others because the community has always acted against you.

Judged Unfairly: Somehow you come across the wrong way to people, and they universally distrust and underestimate you. You catch no one's eye, impress no one, and can get no one to take you seriously. If you ever find an exceptional someone who sees you as you want to be seen, you will cling to that person.

Lost Love: You have lost your true love to death, distance, or marriage. You take little joy in life's pleasures and give up easily in the face of difficulty, since you've already lost the most important struggle. On those occasions when you forget yourself and have a good time, you inevitably feel sorrow afterwards, thinking about how it could have been if your love were with you.

Low Self-Esteem: You have a deflated opinion of your own self-worth. You begin the game with only 2 Confidence points.

Magical Air (companions and grogs only): Although you do not have the Gift, you look and act like a magical person. This can be detrimental when dealing with mundane society—you suffer the same -3 penalty to social interaction rolls as magi.

Magic Susceptibility: You are easily affected by magic. You suffer a -3 penalty on all magic resistance and natural resistance rolls, and get -3 to Soak against direct magical damage. However, you receive a +3 bonus when rolling for the effects of beneficial magic.

Meddler: You want to fix other peoples' lives: arrange matches, teach children to sew "properly," or tend the sick. You waste a lot of time and energy on such endeavors, and people usually resent it. You have a Personality Trait of Meddlesome +3 and a bad Reputation, level 1, as a meddler. If you are a magus, you probably interfere in the affairs of other magi, companions, and apprentices. You don't violate Hermetic law, but you probably come close—and you almost certainly irritate the other magi of your covenant.

Missing Ear: You cannot accurately locate the direction of sounds, and suffer a penalty of -3 to hearing rolls.

Missing Eye: You cannot judge close distances easily and get -3 on Attack rolls for missiles. In melee combat you suffer -1 on Attack rolls because your field of vision is limited. You also have a blind side from which people can approach unseen. This Flaw can be combined with Poor Eyesight (below), but the penalties are cumulative.

Oath of Fealty: You owe one season of service each year to someone or some organization outside the covenant. Additionally, you must justify your actions to those persons, and sometimes there is a conflict between your oath and your activities in the covenant. Magi are forbidden from taking Oaths of Fealty by the Hermetic Code.

Obese: You are large because of fat, not muscle. You are at -1 to all rolls that involve moving quickly or gracefully and at -3 to all Fatigue rolls. Your Size is +1, and so you gain one Hurt Body level. You do not gain an extra Fatigue level.

Obligation (companions and grogs): You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.
