ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

inventing a new spell. The level of the effect is the equivalent of its spell level. You should confirm your effect level with the storyguide. Also, remember the effect's starting level. The actual level of the effect may change as you define the parameters of the effect, but the starting level is essential to scores, like Penetration, that are needed when the effect is used.

After laying out the parameters of the effect, you must decide how frequently you use the effect. Consult the "Effect Frequency Table." The number you choose corresponds to a modifier, which is added to the level of the effect. Next, if the effect is not of Constant Use, you must specify a triggering action or ritual of some kind to activate the effect. The trigger must be specific about exactly what actions need to be performed. A trigger can involve a command word or phrase, moving the item in a specific way (for example, waving or pointing a wand), a stance to be adopted, or anything physical that you can imagine. The enchanted item cannot read thoughts, so the trigger action must be physical, not mental.

Finally, choose any effect modifications you wish to apply to the device (see below), adjusting the level of the effect for each modification.

## Effect Modifications

You have some options on how effects in an invested device operate. They are listed below. These modifications defy the "standards" for invested devices which are described under "Using Invested Devices," below.

|  Frequency | Modifier  |
| --- | --- |
|  1 use per day | 0  |
|  2 uses per day | +1  |
|  3 uses per day | +2  |
|  6 uses per day | +3  |
|  12 uses per day | +4  |
|  24 uses per day | +5  |
|  50 uses per day | +6  |
|  Unlimited. | +10  |
|  Constant use. | +5  |

Note: constant use can only apply to effects that can function constantly, such as invisibility.

Vis Pumping In the Field: When investing an effect, you may leave the effect open, giving the item's user the option to use vis "in the field" to increase the effect's range and duration. For each factor of range and duration that you want to leave open to accept vis in the field, add +3 to the effect's level. For instance, a healing wand only heals damage temporarily unless vis is used with it (the same amount of vis that is required for the spell being imitated). Therefore, you must leave the user the option to add vis to extend the duration of the effect, thereby adding 3 levels to the effect. The number of pawns of vis that may be used in the field to extend range and duration is limited. The wielder may only expend a number of pawns of vis equal to his score in the Art that corresponds to the type of vis being used.

Penetration: You may elect to have the effect make Penetration rolls using the Art scores you had when the effect was originally invested, rather than using the device's own power, by adding +4 to the level. (Of course, this means you must record these scores for future use.) You may also elect to have the effect Penetrate according to the current Art scores of its wielder. This adds +8 to the effect's level.
