CHAPTER IV
LABORATORY
99

Sympathetic Fatigue: Ranged. When either of the two of you is Fatigued, the other must make a stress Fatigue roll of 6+, or lose a Fatigue level (two levels on a botch). The two of you almost always sleep together.

Sympathetic Pain: Ranged. When either of the two of you is wounded or in pain, the other feels pain as well. For the round following that in which the original wound is inflicted, both of you suffer the wound penalty inflicted. If one of you is already at a lower Body level than the other, his lesser wounds have no effect on the other. You each also gain a muscular reflex action of the other, probably one associated with pain.

## –10 Bond Qualities

At Odds: The two of you clash with on a regular basis, bickering and arguing, occasionally to the point where you refuse to speak to each other. The two of you may purposefully work against each other in many cases, but you always join together fiercely in times of need (take a “Loyalty to Familiar +3” Personality Trait). Also, you each gain one debate tactic or other mental tactic of the other.

Tight Bond: The two of you gain most benefits of your bond only when you are touching. Any positive bond qualities marked as “ranged” are only in effect when you are touching. You each gain some physical skin trait of the other.

Sympathetic Wounds: Ranged. When either of you is wounded (that is, takes a Body level of damage), the other must make a Stamina + Size stress roll of 6+, or be wounded for the same amount. If you botch the roll, you suffer an additional Body level of damage. You each gain one of the other’s instinctive fears (fear of spiders, snakes, fire, certain predators). Take a Flaw or Personality Trait of +3 in the appropriate fear.

## The Familiar as a Character

Your familiar retains any of the natural abilities it had before it became your familiar, but you must be sure you attuned all of its magical powers to Hermetic magic. If you don’t have enough points to attune all your familiar’s magical Powers, those unaccounted for are lost when the animal undergoes the closing ritual.

Your familiar’s Intelligence is now only one point lower than yours (assuming it had animal intelligence before). If the creature had higher than animal Intelligence before meeting you, it retains that Intelligence after becoming bound to you. However, even with one less Intelligence point than you, your familiar may be more intelligent than you in performing certain tasks, like predicting the weather without using magic.

Your familiar should have Personality Traits appropriate to its bestial ways, either selected by you or selected by whoever introduces the beast to the saga. Most familiars also have a quirk or two, such as a penchant for recalling irrelevant details or an obsessive delight in the color blue.

Your familiar’s speech is only intelligible to you, unless you choose bond qualities that state otherwise.

The familiar uses your Forms or its own Magic Resistance, whichever is better, to resist spells. It can use a Parma Magica if you grant it one, but not in conjunction with its own Magic Resistance. You each are able to circumvent the other’s Magic Resistance at will.

## The Familiar in Play

You and your familiar will undoubtedly grow closer as the saga progresses, learning from each other and strengthening your common bond. Over the years, your familiar learns what you know, provided that you keep the familiar with you when you study and that you share your knowledge with it.

At any time during the saga, you may spend a season re-tempering your bond, which allows you to add new positive bond qualities if your total for determining your bond score has increased. The total that may be added is the difference between your new score and you old one. In no case may you increase the strength of the cords, however, and you may never change a bond quality that you have already established. Re-tempering the bond costs three Vim vis, as the bond is closed again.

At the end of any story, the storyguide may choose to award you a new bond quality (good or bad). This usually results if you and your familiar grew closer together during the story, often a result of your accomplishing some important goal through the use of your bond, or a result of having survived a hardship together. The storyguide may choose to give you one good bond quality and one bad bond quality that balance out each other.

Your familiar ages along with you, generally dying a few days before or several weeks after you. The sudden death of your familiar is a warning of immediate danger. Should you ever die while your familiar remains alive, your familiar will experience a shock that may kill it, and even if it lives, it is reduced to a pathetic, devastated condition ever after. Likewise, if you survive your familiar, you may feel a profound emptiness in your life that may last for months, or even years. Having a familiar is a personal, private thing, so only those more concerned with status than true companionship use their familiars as status symbols. You should hold the same level of protectiveness for your familiar that you would for a spouse.

You can only have one familiar at a time. Your familiar will be with you for a long time, so make it interesting.
