# Chapter II
## Characters

To tell the stories of Mythic Europe, you will need a character. If you are telling the story of an entire covenant, you will probably need more than one. This chapter contains the ideas, rules, and other material you need to create your characters in Ars Magica—the people your saga and your game revolve around.

When you create a character, you must first envision a person who will take part in stories. Once you have an idea in your mind, you can translate that vision, generating the statistics you will need to use that character in the game. But while you can't play the game without the numbers, you should be aware that they are only a device. The soul of your character lies in the details you invent to make him or her interesting and entertaining.

Creating a character can be somewhat confusing at first, but the more often you do it, the easier it becomes. Take your time, especially when designing your first magus. Depending on how quickly you want to make decisions and how familiar you are with these rules, it can take anywhere from five minutes to more than an hour to create a character. In general, the longer you spend, the more developed and well thought-out your character will be.

Furthermore, you should create a personality that suits the saga being told, the covenant to which all characters belong, and the troupe with which you play. After all, Ars Magica is designed to help you tell stories not only about your character, but also about his brethren in the covenant. That means that you and your troupe should create characters who can live and work together—and together weave fabulous tales of romance and adventure.

## Types of Characters

There are three different types of characters in Ars Magica: magi, companions, and grogs. They are not "character classes" such as you might find in other games, but three broad character categories. Each has a unique role in the saga and a certain degree of power. Slightly different rules apply to each, though the basic concepts are the same.

Generally, each player creates a magus, a companion, and one or more grogs. In the troupe style of play, you will switch between playing your magus and companion as needed throughout the saga. Your grogs, on the other hand, usually take part in each story. Grogs tend to be needed in considerable numbers, so magi and companions who are abroad keep a group of them, called a turb (from a Latin word meaning "mob"), in retainer.

## Magi

Magi are the primary focus of the game, which is designed to emulate all the mythic spellcasting possibilities we see in films and read in novels—possibilities that are often given short shrift in other roleplaying systems. Magi therefore have immense magical ability, even as beginning characters, which makes them very powerful. Magi in Ars
