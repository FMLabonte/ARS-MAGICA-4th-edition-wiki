ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# Durations

Momentary: The spell lasts but a moment and then dissipates. Any effect that it has remains, however. This is the normal duration for combat spells.

Concentration/Diameter: Concentration: The spell lasts as long as the magus concentrates. Diameter: The spell lasts for the time that the sun takes to move its diameter in the sky—almost exactly two minutes. (Diameter and Concentration are the same "level" of duration.)

Sun: The spell lasts until the sun next rises or sets.

Ring/Moon: Ring: The spell lasts until the target of the spell moves outside a ring drawn at the time of casting, or until the ring is physically broken. Moon: The spell lasts until both the new and full moon have been in the sky. (Moon and Ring are the same "level" of duration.)

A ring must actually be drawn while the spell is being cast. The magus may use magic to do so, but that magic must not have a range greater than Touch, and the magus must physically trace out the ring. The casting of a non-Ritual spell may be extended out to allow the drawing of a large ring. However, the caster must make Concentration + Intelligence rolls of 6+ every round to maintain concentration on the spell, and if someone breaks the ring at any point before it is completed, the spell automatically botches. Really large rings are unlikely to be worth the risk.

Season: The spell lasts until the next solstice or equinox after its casting.

Year: The spell lasts until the fourth equinox or solstice after its casting.

Permanent/Instant: Permanent: The spell lasts forever, but remains forever magical. Thus, it could be dispelled at some point in the future. This duration is only available for spells which have magical effects: natural effects are Instant duration instead. Instant: The spell effect persists for ever as a mundane thing. It cannot be magically dispelled, although it can be destroyed by any method which would destroy the mundane thing that it is. This duration is only available for spells which have natural effects. Note also that this duration cannot be attained for magical creation or healing without the use of raw vis. (Permanent and Instant are the same "level" of effect.)

# Target

Small: Affects a small item, something a person of average strength could comfortably hold or carry with both hands.

Individual: The spell can affect a single discrete thing, such as one person or one object. A huge boulder is a discrete object, a mountain is not (because it is joined to the ground).

Group/Room: Group: The spell can affect a small group of people or things. There should be no more than about a dozen things, and they must be an obvious group. Three grogs huddled together or a ring of standing stones are a group: six people out of a crowd are usually not. Room: The spell affects a chamber and everyone or thing within it. This room can be very large (the nave of a cathedral, for instance, or a natural cave), but it must be enclosed and have definite boundaries. A courtyard would often count, a valley would not. (Group and Room are the same "level" of effect.)

Circle/Structure: Circle: The spell affects everything within a ring drawn by the magus at the time of casting, and ends if the circle is broken, irrespective of the nominal duration of the spell. See Ring, above, for restrictions on drawing the circle. Structure: The spell affects a single structure and everything within it. The structure can range in size from a hut to a castle, but it must be a single, linked edifice. As a rule of thumb, if it is all covered by one roof, it is one structure, but storyguide discretion applies. (Circle and Structure are the same "level" of effect.)

Boundary: The spell affects everything within a well-defined natural or man-made boundary. This could be the wall of a city, the edge of a village, the shores of a lake, the edge of a forest, or the bottom of a mountain. Since the ocean is not obviously bounded, it cannot be affected in this way. The magus must be able to see most of the bounded area unless the spell is being cast at Arcane Connection range.

Sight: The spell affects everything within sight of the caster.

# Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets

Each combination of Technique and Form lists default ranges, durations, and targets for those spells. These are known as the basic range, basic duration, and basic target. These are used to determine the level of newly created spells, or of spontaneous spells.

To calculate the level for a spell using those Arts but with different characteristics, refer to the lists above. For every step by which a category is raised, add five levels to the level of the spell. For every step by which one is lowered, subtract five levels. If subtractions take the level below five, subtract single levels instead. No spell can be lowered below level 1.
