CHAPTER VII
STORYGUIDE

# Training

A character may be trained in any Skill or Knowledge by a trainer who has a score of at least three and whose score exceeds the trainee's score. In one season of training, the trainee gains one experience point. The trainee receives one more experience point if his Intelligence is greater than zero, and one more experience point if the trainer's Communication is higher than zero (for a maximum gain of three experience points in one season). A trainer may teach a number of people equal to his Communication + Ability total simultaneously (though always at least 1).

Characters with the Gift may be trained in spells. The trainer must know the spells to be taught, and the total number of levels that can be taught in one season is the trainee's sum of (Technique + Form + Intelligence + Magic Theory) plus the trainer's Communication + Magic Theory. Spells of more than one Technique/Form combination can be trained, but then the total number of levels is limited by the lowest Technique/Form combination used. A trainer may only teach spells to one student at a time.

# Practice

A character who practices a Skill or Talent for a season may learn something even without formal training. If you already have at least one level in a Skill or Talent, you may declare you are spending a season practicing your ability. You should explain to the troupe what activities you are pursuing in order to practice it, such as working as the village blacksmith or hunting in the woods all summer. At the end of a season spent honing or using the Ability, roll a stress die. If the result you roll is three times your current level, you gain three experience points in it. If the result is twice your current level, gain two, and if it is only equal to or over your current level in that Skill, you gain one. A botch reflects a very poor season or a major mistake you made in practice which you waste the rest of the season making up for.

It is also possible to practice a spell and eventually master it (see "Mastering Spells" on page 75). A magus may dedicate a season to such practice, and at the end of the season, gains a number of experience points equal to his Intelligence towards mastering that spell.

# Exposure

A character can gain experience in Casual Knowledges simply through exposure over a period of time. For each season that a character is exposed to a Casual Knowledge on a daily basis, he gains two experience points in that Knowledge if he has a positive Intelligence, or one experience point otherwise. Exposure can never bring a character's score above four.

Exposure is subjective, and the storyguide is the final arbiter of what is appropriate exposure and what is not. As an example, living in a community where a given unfamiliar language is spoken and interacting with local folk on a daily basis would count as exposure to that language. Living in the same community, but studying obsessively in a University where only Latin is spoken would not be particularly worthwhile (at least as concerns learning the local language).

# Lectio

Lectio is formal teaching based around a text, and can only be used to teach Knowledges. Lectio is similar to giving a lecture, and thus many students may be taught at once. The limit is the teacher's Communication + Lectio total.

Each member of the audience generates a Study Total. This total is the teacher's Communication + Lectio, plus half the Quality of the book being read (round down), plus the student's Intelligence. A number of experience points equal to the Study Total divided by five (rounded up) is gained by each student.

A student can only learn from one season given by one teacher on one text. Further seasons on the same text must be by different teachers and further seasons by the same teacher must be on different texts.

# Disputatio

Disputatio is formal teaching of Arts and Knowledges based on the posing and answering of questions. A teacher may only teach one person at a time in this manner, and must have a score of at least five in the Art or three in the Knowledge to do so.

The student generates a Study Total equal to the teacher's Intelligence + Disputatio, plus the student's Intelligence + 6. For Arts, the student gains a number of experience points equal to the Study Total. For Knowledges, the number of experience points gained is the Study Total divided by five (rounded up). The maximum gain in one season is three full levels of an Art or Knowledge. In no case may a student exceed his trainer's score in the Art or Knowledge being taught. As long as the teacher has a high-
