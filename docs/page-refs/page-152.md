ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

A 10-inch crystal dart rises from the ground at your feet, floats into the air, and speeds off like an arrow at a target that is within Far range. It does +10 damage.

## Level 15

### The Forgiving Earth

R: Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Handful of Silt (+3)

Weakens earth in a 15-pace-by-15-pace area, making packed dirt as loose as plowed ground.

### Unyielding Earth

R: Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Clod of Packed Earth (+3)

Makes the surface of the ground in a 15-pace-by-15-pace area become more solid. Mud becomes as soft earth, and soft earth becomes as packed dirt.

### Rock of Viscid Clay

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Bit of a Dwarven Pick (+5)

Softens rock enough that it may be dug out, molded, and otherwise manipulated in the same way that hard river clay can be. The rock is slightly sticky. The spell affects rock in a roughly spherical shape with a three-foot diameter.

## Level 20

### Earth that Breaks No More

R: Reach/Sight, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Chunk of Stone (+1)

Turns a volume of packed dirt up to the size of a Room into stone.

## Level 25

### Statue to Animal

R: Reach, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Requisite: Animál

Enchants a hand-sized earthen or stone statue of an animal. Later, anytime someone gives the command word (identified during the ritual), the statue turns into a life-sized specimen of the animal represented. The animal follows the orders of the person who gives the command word, and reverts to statue form when killed or when commanded to revert. If the animal is killed, the statue is no longer magical. One must touch the statue when giving the command word.

## Level 35

### Teeth of the Earth Mother

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Spec

Aimed: -3/0

Spell Focus: The ivory tusk of a great elephant (+1)

Requisite: Rego

You cause twenty pointed pillars of white marble to spring up from the ground to a height of 12 feet, forming a circle 3 paces in diameter. At their tops, the pillars are thin and as sharp as spears. At the base, where they touch, they are 18 inches thick. When the pillars spring up, they can be used to cage people, to form a wall, or simply to skewer enemies. To skewer a target, you must make a targeting roll with a penalty of -3, but to capture a target you must make a standard targeting roll. Climbing to the top of the pillars requires three Climb stress rolls of 12+, and the tops break away when the target reaches them, causing the victim to fall. Skewering a target does +25 damage, possibly more on following rounds if the victim struggles or is exceptionally heavy. When the spell ends, the pillars crumble to dust.

## Perdo Terram Guidelines

To destroy sand, mud, or clay, use the same level of magnitude as for earth. To destroy stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To destroy metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude.

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Momentary (the damage remains), and basic target is Small.

Level 3: Destroy one property of dirt.

Level 4: Destroy dirt.

## Perdo Terram Spells

## Level 10

### Fist of Shattering

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: Bit of a Shattered Rock (+3)

An object of stone or weaker material that weighs up to 5 pounds breaks apart. The appropriate Form for the target is a casting requisite.

### Rusted Decay of Ten-Score Years

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Handful of Rust (+1)

After the spell is cast, the metal of the target becomes so thoroughly rusted that it breaks if used in any demanding way (for example, used to strike a blow with in combat or to pry open a door). It also loses any sharpness it might once have had.

## Level 15

### Pit of the Gaping Earth

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Earth Taken from a Deep Cavern (+1)

The dirt in a circle 6 paces across recedes into the ground, leaving a pit 9 feet deep.
