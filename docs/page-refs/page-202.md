Covenants

A covenant, most basically, is a place where a group of magi live together. It might be in a manor, a castle, a ship, or a hole in the ground. Covenants provide for the needs of magi in several ways. First of all, they provide security. Mythic Europe is a dangerous place for all, and magi in particular need safety to perform their arcane studies. Covenants also provide for the mundane needs of magi: food, clothing, work space, and the like. Most magi would prefer not to have to devote their time to such concerns. Finally, covenants provide magi with a community of peers. When in a covenant, a magus is surrounded by others who think about things in the same way that he does.

Covenants are also the most meaningful way the members of different houses work together and learn from one another. Although some covenants are composed only of members from one house, at least two thirds are composed of magi of different traditions.

In fact, loyalty to one's covenant is often the strongest loyalty a magus feels, even more than loyalty to his house. Of course such feelings vary from magus to magus, but the prevalence of such an attitude is an indicator of the importance of covenants to the Order of Hermes.

Of course, covenants are important from a troupe standpoint as well. A covenant provides a reason for the characters to work together, and gives them common goals. It provides for unity in a saga, and shapes its direction.

## Covenant Creation

The most common way to play Ars Magica is for the troupe to create a covenant to serve as a home base for all of the magi played by members of the troupe. Although other possibilities are certainly conceivable, this method is a very satisfying way to play the game. All the players have a say in the characteristics of the covenant, almost as if the covenant were a character controlled by the troupe in common.

This chapter is much like the Character Creation chapter. It defines the characteristics covenants can have, and provides game mechanisms that will allow you to create a covenant balanced with both good features and drawbacks.

&gt; As there are four seasons in a year, there are four seasons in the life of a covenant. A covenant begins in Spring, a time of rapid growth but instability, and then moves on to Summer, during which it comes into its prime of vitality and ambition. Autumn marks the high point of the covenant's influence, as the magi harvest from what has already been grown, but the decline into Winter is certain, when the covenant is barely able to cling to the shadow of life. While each covenant takes its own course through time, whatever path it charts, it always witnesses the inevitable unfolding of the seasons.

## Seasons

Covenants, like characters, have definite lifespans. Each stage of a covenant's life has different characteristics and identifying challenges. These stages, typical to all covenants, are often referred to as the seasons of covenants. Starting at spring and moving in turn through summer, autumn, and finally winter, covenants move from birth to death just like people.
