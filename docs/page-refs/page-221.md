CHAPTER X
MYTHIC EUROPE

for settlers from other lands (particularly Germany), offering them land and special treatment in the villages they settle. Henryk's aim is to settle 10,000 new families. Many Germans have settled in cities, which often have two common names—one German, one Slavic. Jews are also common to the cities, and they are treated with more tolerance here than in many other countries. Slavery is still widely practiced, but the Church is trying to end it.

The Balts, who populate the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and the cold northern forests, cleave to their ancient pagan ways and defiantly resist conversion to Christianity. German knights, back from the crusades, have spoken of bringing them the Cross by means of the Sword, should the words of missionaries fail to be persuasive.

# Hungary

The Magyar people, led by their Prince Árpád, crossed the Carpathian Mountains and settled the fertile valley of the Danube late in the ninth century. Árpád's descendants, among them saints and great warriors, are the kings of Hungary. King Béla III, who ruled from 1173 to 1196, reconquered territories from the Byzantines and ruled with strength.

Béla's successors, Emery (ruled 1196-1204) and now Andrew II, have been less successful monarchs. Andrew has become unpopular, and troubles plague the land. Discontented nobles and clergy complain of high taxes, too many arrests, and royal confiscation of property. Counterfeit money has become a major problem, too. That is especially hurtful, since the Danube is one of Europe's great trade routes—and Buda, the largest city in the kingdom, is on the river. Some Hungarians nobles and powerful clergy know of the Magna Charta agreed to by King John of England, and they would like a similar covenant to lay out the rights and duties of the free peoples of Hungary.

Hungarian stories preserve the memories of the Magyar homeland, in distant Siberia, and the kindred tribes left behind when Árpád's people journeyed to the west. Some Hungarian clergy dream of finding their ancestral land and distant brethren who share their language, to bring them the Good News of Christianity.

# Serbia

A relatively new country, Serbia has ties to both East and West. Stephen II was made king in 1217 by the pope, but since most of the clergy and peasantry of the land is Orthodox, he was crowned a second time according to those rites. The nobility is currently adopting Western standards, and many once-free peasants are now being reduced to serfs.

The free city of Ragusa on the Adriatic coast is in Serb territory, an independent city-state and a thorn in the side of King Stephen. He is trying to gain control of the city, which is being threatened by the despot of Epirus and is appealing to the powerful merchants of Venice for protection.

# Bulgarian Empire

This empire, ruled by the ambitious and iron-fisted Ivan II, is an ally of the Byzantine emperor in Nicaea and is constantly skirmishing with the Latin states to the south, as well as Hungary. In 1204, the Bulgars took Belgrade and some Hungarian territory for themselves, and are currently claiming lands on all borders. The Slavic Bulgars and the Magyars of Hungary have a mutual history of war that goes back to when the Magyars were a migratory heathen tribe.

The city of Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, and sits on a major trade route between Hungary and Constantinople. Cattle drives pass through here, and the stockyards to the west of the city are a gathering place for the Bulgarian army before major campaigns.

# Russia

The fragmentation of Russia began after the death of Yaroslav in 1054, as his sons divided the domain he had ruled from Kiev. The land is now divided into feuding principalities. Chief amongst them are Kiev in the south and the Republic of Novgorod in the north. Novgorod, which achieved complete independence from Kiev in 1136, is ruled by a Grand Prince and an assembly of citizens. It is stretching eastward to the Urals, settling new lands, building great monasteries such as Archangel and establishing profitable trade routes (especially for fur).

Between Kiev and the Black Sea are the lands of the Polovtsi, Asiatic nomads who have challenged the Russian princes in the past. To the east and southeast lurks a greater danger: the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan, who have nearly reached the eastern shores of the Black Sea and will soon threaten the gates of Europe.
