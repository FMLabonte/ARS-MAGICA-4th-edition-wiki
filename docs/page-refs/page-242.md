THE ART OF MAGIC

# Faerie Areas

Areas of faerie power may cover ancient pagan lands, spring up about faerie queens, or protect valued locations. They may have only a few inhabitants, each quite powerful. On the other hand, they may be the domiciles of innumerable faeries with little power individually, but whose numbers give them strength enough to be respected and avoided.

Faerie areas with lower level auras tend to be inhabited by faeries that are merely annoying, or barely more than helpful; they are almost never capable of killing. Such places are relatively common wherever mortals have spread their influence. On the other hand, especially in rural and wilderness areas, there are auras of immense power inhabited by faeries that can will themselves taller than a church spire or shake the Earth's foundation at a command.

Sites of faerie aura take as many forms as their inconstant inhabitants. They might contain talking trees and owls, strange lights at night, and unearthly eyes peering out of the darkness. An aura may exceed the physical bounds of the locale, depending on how far the resident faeries journey or extend their power. The table below gives examples of typical aura ratings.

Regardless of the danger, magi often risk entering faerie areas in pursuit of magical power. They are places rich in vis—reason enough to challenge many perils, particularly for a magus deprived of magical resources.

# Arcadia

The most powerful faerie sites are sometimes gateways to Arcadia—Faerieland itself. Such gateways may be small and unassuming, rarely used and little known, or massive entrances traversed by the greatest of faerie entities. Mortals do not naturally belong in the land of the fay, and those who

enter often fail to return. Even if they do come back, they may find a day spent in Arcadia is one, ten, even a hundred years, or only a minute, in the mundane world.

However odd places of faerie aura may be, they are still a part of the mortal world. Arcadia is a separate world altogether. It is a wondrous place, far more beautiful than the mundane realm, and far more bizarre. Sunlight in Arcadia never burns or dazzles, trees are never uneven or sick—everything is naturally perfect. However, perfection does not necessarily equal beauty; perfect evil, perfect hate, and perfect indifference all exist there as well.

Magic, too, behaves differently in Arcadia than in the mortal world. Spells of creation and destruction, in particular, are not reliable there. Most faerie inhabitants can use a form of magic called "glamour"—some of them better than the greatest of magi—whereas few mundanes understand even the simplest magical designs. Faeries work magic as mortals speak or play an instrument. It is a part of them.

Arcadia is a land untouched by mortal hands. There are no cleared plots, felled trees, or peasant fields. Magic sustains what crops are grown. Majestic and forgotten creatures, as well as deer, wolves, boars, and bears, roam virgin oak forests protected by powerful animal spirits. While there are few cities in Arcadia, those that stand are inhabited by strange, potent, human-seeming fay; these cities are large and airy, quite unlike the walled warrens of the mortal world.

Arcadia is a physical place, but it is also a sphere of pure enchantment and imagination. Movement is not easily described, being more like the half-remembered travels of a dream, and so magi of House Merinita (who know best) scoff at the idea of making a map of Arcadia. Like a dream state, Faerieland is often incomprehensible to mortals who go there. There is not always a logical relationship between cause and effect, and it is easy to become totally disoriented, especially as faeries enjoy using their glamour to lead intruders astray. And yet, some Merinita magi insist that Arcadia is not a chaotic place, but merely has its own rules. Whether this is true or not, Arcadia is best left to faeries, and to the foolish among mortals.

# The Divine Realm

The divine realm is the manifestation of the supernatural power of God, the Church, and all those with faith in His existence. The church views other auras as evil, aligned with the forces of Hell. Magi, of course, often beg to differ. The Church and the Order of Hermes are often at odds
