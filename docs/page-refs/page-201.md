CHAPTER VIII

SAGA

Because the Dominion is ever-present in any good-sized town, magical actions are severely curtailed. That might be a good thing, though, as people tend to unite against strangers who toss fire between their hands. Indeed, the city often proves one of the clergy's greatest weapons against magi of the Order, since in cities, in front of countless witnesses, the Church can condemn wizards and gain the greatest possible support.

# Advanced Storytelling Techniques

Once you've mastered the basics of being a storyguide, you can experiment with techniques and special effects that can add greater depth to a game. Used improperly, though, the ideas presented below can weaken a story, so you should have some experience as a storyguide before attempting them. Some are difficult even for an experienced actor, and must be carefully planned and executed in order to work effectively. If you can pull these stunts off, however, you will create scenes your players will never forget.

# Flashbacks

Flashbacks occur in movies and television all the time. In a roleplaying game, you can flash back to a scene or scenes in a character's history. You might want to do this to provide clues, to give the players some insight, or to put a different spin on current events.

Flashback scenes and even stories can be played either separately from other stories, or can be intertwined. You can either run short flashbacks, interacting with one character as the other players look on, or you can play flashbacks that the entire covenant is involved with. You can even assign the players roles that they do not normally play, but are important to the back story. You can even specifically design the flashback story to be played as a sort of interlude between the acts of the main story. The two stories can be separated by time or space, but must be somehow connected in theme, mood, or subject, complementing and reflecting each other.

You can also experiment with flashing forward, making your players wonder whether the future is set in stone, or whether what they are seeing is the future at all.

# Parallel Story

A parallel story is much like a flashback in that it is played out alongside the main story. A parallel story, however, takes place at the same time as the first. At some point the two stories will likely intersect and the characters from each will meet, so you probably don't want to conclude the parallel story until you're near the end of the primary one. It's essential that you time things carefully—and watch out, because your players are unlikely to cooperate.

# Symbolism

Having something in a story represent something else is an ancient literary technique that can add a great deal of depth and intensity. By judiciously referring to and emphasizing the symbols inherent in a story, you can add power to your themes and make a point or two along the way. Ars Magica holds many symbols, though there is no correct interpretation for any of them.

# Moods

The moods you try to evoke will dramatically influence how your players react to your stories. Creating emotional ambiance can be taxing, but usually pays off in the end. You should decide beforehand what emotion you hope to evoke in a given scene or story. Possibilities might include horror, wonder, pity, or romance.

To create a given mood, realize that the players will be looking to you, as storyguide, for cues about how they should be acting. If you're acting silly when the scene should be horrific, don't expect your players to behave appropriately. Pursue the chosen mood with intensity; accept no other response. Everything you say and do must reflect the mood you are trying to establish. If you want to evoke drama, discourage your players from joking around.

Appropriate background music, lighting, special effects, and props can all help when you are trying to create a mood. Be creative.
