# Brawling Maneuvers Table

**Maneuver: Damage Replacement (Soak Replacement)**

**Attack:** For each Wound level replaced, opponent loses 1 Fatigue level (Regular Soak)

**Throws:** If at least 2 Wound levels are replaced, you unbalance and topple your opponent while remaining standing yourself. Opponent lands at Close range. (Dex + Size)

**Tackling:** If at least 1 Wound level is replaced, you knock your opponent down while going down yourself. The two of you land at Touch range. (Dex + Size)

**Wrestling for an Item:** If at least 2 Wound levels are replaced, you grab the item from your opponent, or knock it to the ground (at your option). (Str)

**Immobilizing:** For each Wound level replaced, you have your opponent held, putting him at a cumulative −3 to Attack and Defense until he breaks free. (Str + Enc)

**Breaking Free:** If at least 1 Wound level is replaced, you free yourself from your opponent's hold, winding up at Reach range. (Str + Enc)

# Unarmed Combat

Making an unarmed attack requires that you be in Touch range with your foe. Often, this means that you will be inside the range of your opponent's Reach weapons, and he will be forced to either accept a large penalty or brawl himself. This makes darting into Touch range a decent defense against a slow opponent who is armed with a longer range weapon.

Before rolling to hit when brawling unarmed, you must determine what sort of brawling maneuver you are attempting. Each option is outlined on the Brawling Maneuvers Table. You may only select one maneuver per opponent each round. After a maneuver is chosen, generate Attack and Defense Totals as described under "Melee," above.

When generating a Damage Total, instead of using your opponent's regular Soak, use the value listed for the type of maneuver you are using. Once a number of Wound levels has been determined, replace each Wound level with the equivalent result described under the type of maneuver.

# Monstrous Combat

Beasts often have special attacks developed individually by the storyguide. Unorthodox attacks often affect the way the combat rolls work. Imagine a fire drake that pounces on its opponents. A Brawling defense could get you out of its way, but a Shield and Weapon defense might just put the shield between you and it. In this case, you would still be knocked to the ground, pinned and perhaps crushed. On the other hand, the shield might at least protect you from some of the creature's claws. Because of their special attacks, beasts and monsters are often exceedingly dangerous in combat. Storyguides should use their imagination and the rules presented here as guidelines to determine how monsters with special attacks fit into the combat system. You can also refer to the Bestiary chapter for ideas.

# Attacking Objects

Sometimes you may want to direct an attack against an inanimate object, such as an enemy's magic item or a door. Compute your Attack Total normally, but compare it to an ease factor set by the storyguide instead of a Defense Total. To determine how much damage the item sustains, the sto

# Example of Unarmed Combat

Victor the Hulking Brute and Speedy Tomas have engaged one another at Touch range. Victor will attempt to squash poor Tomas (selecting the attack option), while Tomas will use his agility to topple Victor (throwing him). Victor gets a Damage score of 9. Tomas must resist using his regular Soak score, which is 1 (he has no armor and a Stm of +1). He therefore takes a Damage Total of 8, which would normally do one Wound level, but that is converted to one Fatigue level of damage, as per the damage replacement effect. Tomas manages to generate a Damage score of 8. Victor must resist the throw using his Dex + Size instead of his Soak, a total of −2 (his Size is +1, but his Dexterity is −3). Therefore, Victor does 2 Body levels of damage (8 − [−2] = 10, divided by 5 = 2), enough for the throw to be successful. Although Tomas has taken a hit, Victor now lies on the ground.
