# Summae

A *summa* (plural summae) is a work distilling all that a scholar knows about an Art or Knowledge into a single book. As such, they take a lot of effort to write but are very valuable for study. Each summa is described by two factors: its level, which represents how much knowledge is contained in it, and its Quality, representing how well it is written.

To convert texts from the third edition of *Ars Magica* to these rules, keep their level constant and give them a Quality equal to half their level. For example, an *Ignem* 12 text becomes an *Ignem* summa with level 12 and quality 6.

## Writing Summae

When a summa is started, the level of the finished book is determined. The level may be chosen freely by the author, up to half of his score in the appropriate Art or Knowledge.

Once the level is determined, writing commences. For every season spent writing, the character accumulates a number of points equal to his Communication + Scribe. When the total of points equals or exceeds the level of the summa, it is complete. The level of the book may not be changed midway through the writing (if the character improves the Art or Knowledge, for example). Once begun, the book must be finished at the initial level or not finished at all.

Once finished, a Quality is assigned to the work. The Quality of the completed summa is equal to the author's Communication + Scribe + 3.

For example, Quintus, who has a score of 24 in *Ignem* and a Communications + Scribe of 5, wants to write an *Ignem* summa. He decides that the level of the summa will be twelve, the maximum that he can select. During the first season of writing he accumulates five points (his Communication + Scribe). He accumulates another five in the second season, taking him to ten, and five more in the third, for a total of fifteen. Fifteen is higher than twelve, so the book is completed in the third season. The Quality of the summa is 8 (his Communication + Scribe + 3).

Copying existing summa is not nearly as difficult or time consuming as writing them. A copyist may fully copy a number of levels of summa equal to his (Scribe + Dexterity) times 3 per season.

|  Summa Study Example  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Season | Ignem Score | Experience
Points Toward
Next Level  |
|  1 | 3 | 0*  |
|  2 | 5 | 5  |
|  3 | 7 | 6  |
|  4 | 9 | 3  |
|  5 | 10 | 7  |
|  6 | 11 | 10  |
|  7 | 12 | 0**  |
|  * Quinta can gain no more than 3 levels per season. If she could use her full 14 experience points, she would have a score of 4 with 4 extra experience points.  |   |   |
|  ** Quinta does not gain the full 14 experience points in season 7, because she cannot gain experience points that would bring her above level 12, the level of the summa she is studying.  |   |   |

## Reading Summae

When reading a summa, the student generates a Study Total equal to his Intelligence + Concentration + the summa's Quality. For every season of study the student gains this number of experience points in an Art, or this number of experience points divided by five (rounded up) in a Knowledge. In no case may the student gain more than three full levels in an Art or Knowledge in a season. Excess experience points over those for the three levels are wasted.

A student may continue to study a summa as long as his score in the Art or Knowledge that it concerns is lower than the level of the text. Thus, a summa may be studied for several seasons with profit.

For example, Quinta, who has a score of 0 in *Ignem* and an Intelligence + Concentration total of 6, decides to study Quintus' summa, which has a level of 12 and a Quality of 8. She has a Study Total of 14 (her Intelligence + Scribe + the summa's quality), and thus gains 14 experience points per season. The chart summarizes her advancement by season.
