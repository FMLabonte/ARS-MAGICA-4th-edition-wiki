CHAPTER VIII

SAGA

195

# Supporting Cast

Creating the people who inhabit your world is one of the most enjoyable jobs you have as storyguide. Your characters should be just as alive as the players' characters—to have them fall short of this criterion cheats everyone of a good story.

By no means should you create a separate character sheet for everyone in Mythic Europe. Presumably you have a job and other interests. In general, you should detail individuals that the players' characters interact with on a regular basis. At the very least, you should keep notes on the behavior of important figures, their relevant Personality Traits, and their previous interactions with the characters. Minor characters like covenfolk and minor grogs can have generic statistics. These can become building blocks for personalities if you choose to develop them later.

People who are intrinsic to your saga should be as detailed as the players' characters. These figures include patrons, mentors, and allied magi. Not only does fully developing an important character give you a better idea of his role, it eliminates inconsistencies in portrayal. Players often remember things about your characters that you only mention in passing; you

may forget such details, only to be called on later to account for them. By developing these characters, you retain a record of their natures, and can even drop hints that you can act on more fully when you wish.

# The Saga in Play

Actual play is the end that the creation of your saga serves. There are many decisions to be made as the saga progresses. What follows are many points that will help you and your fellows adjudicate the saga as it progresses.

# The Characters

The first order of saga business is to bring the players' characters together. Examine how each knows the others. There are all sorts of options, from childhood friends, to relatives, to rivals. Likewise, they might simply share a common goal (that ties into the goals of the saga, of course), or find themselves thrown together through some twist of fate.

No matter how it happens, though, there should be a very strong bond between members of the group. Why do they trust one another with their lives? Covenant membership on its own is a valid reason for teamwork, but you should encourage more compelling character interrelations. Characters who are indifferent to the survival of their fellows will not work together to tell great stories, and will most likely bicker and stymie the progress of the saga.

The character creation process should be where bonds are first proposed, and the saga's first session should begin to cement those bonds, as the players start to get used to their new roles. New friendships can also develop over the course of the saga.

# The March of Time

## Story Timing

How much time passes in between stories? This is no idle question. Every season that passes is another period of study, practice, and advancement, and every year brings the characters closer to death. Therefore, you need to regulate the amount of time that slips by. If stories occur too close together, magi do not progress far in their Arts and spells, and age may never affect those who begin the saga when
