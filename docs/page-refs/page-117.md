CHAPTER V

SPELLS

Creates a strong undertow that pulls any object smaller than a rowboat 25 fathoms (150 feet) into the depths. Each of those caught in the undercurrent must make 9+ on a Strength + Swim stress roll to avoid being dragged down. A roll is made each round that the spell is maintained.

# Tower of Whirling Water

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Beryl (+1)

From a large body of water you form a waterspout that moves under your mental direction. It causes a simple die + 15 damage to anyone it hits (no Attack roll necessary). In addition, those struck must make a Quickness stress roll of 6+ to avoid being sucked up by the waterspout. Those who fail are helplessly pulled into the spout and begin to drown immediately. When the waterspout fails, they fall up to 20 feet to the water's surface. If you direct the waterspout to move across land, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 9+ each round to maintain it.

# Waves of Drowning and Smashing

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Vial of Water (see below) (+3)

Raises a wave 5 feet high and 30 paces wide, which can submerge swimmers, overturn rowboats, and damage sailing ships. It starts as a small, curved wave and grows for the first 10 paces, at which point it reaches maximum size. If it travels 100 paces without striking an object large enough to break it up, it dissipates. The vial of water must have been taken from a large body of water during a storm.

# Level 60

# Neptune's Wrath

R: Sight, D: Spec, T: Spec, Ritual

A gigantic wave is created in a very large body of water. The wave, which is only 20 feet high but up to a mile wide, is capable of capsizing ships at sea, smashing and drowning people near shore, and utterly destroying coastline communities. The tidal wave needs 5 miles of water surface to build itself up to proper proportions. The magus cannot control the wave without casting another spell.

# Auram Spells

Auram spells are powerful because the element of air is ubiquitous. Their weakness is that air is not usually violent, like fire, nor strong, like earth. Auram, however, includes in its scope most weather phenomena such as storms, lightning, rain, mist, and falling snow. Auram spells usually affect air as phenomena (winds, odors) rather than as gases (a modern concept).

# Creo Auram Guidelines

The basic range is Sight, the basic duration is Momentary, and the basic target is Boundary. Created air disperses at a natural rate (because the duration is Momentary). Non-weather effects should be gauged by their effect relative to the guidelines. For example, poisonous gas doing +5 damage might be roughly equivalent to the amount of damage caused by a tempest.

Sigils in Creo Auram spells commonly give the air specific properties, such as special scents or colors.

Level 5: Create a draft.

Level 10: Create a breeze.

Level 15: Create a wind. Create a fog.

Level 20: Create a squall.

Level 25: Create a thunderstorm.

Level 30: Create a tempest.

Level 45: Create a hurricane.

Level 60: Create lightning.

# Creo Auram Spells

# Level 1

# Air's Ghostly Form

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+5)

A thick fog forms around the magus, extending outwards for several paces. A breeze can push the fog around. The fog dissipates at its natural rate, and may be all gone within as short a time as a minute. The opal has associations with Mercury and the air.

# Chamber of Spring Breezes

R: Reach, D: Sun/Perm, T: Room/Str

Spell Focus: An Agate (+3)

Requisite: Rego

Creates a breeze of fresh air that continually moves throughout a room, keeping the air continuously breathable even if the room is air-
