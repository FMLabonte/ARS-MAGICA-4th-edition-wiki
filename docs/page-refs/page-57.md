CHAPTER II

CHARACTERS

Medieval study is based on the auctores, or authorities, in each subject. These auctores are not regarded as infallible or as having said all of what there is to be said on a subject. They are, however, supposed to have gotten the essentials right and to have accurately divided the subject into its categories. Thus, a medieval scholar might suggest that Aristotle was wrong about a certain kind of logical fallacy, but he would not suggest that Aristotle was completely wrong about logic or that there were fallacies that did not fall under any of his classifications.

Artes Liberales: The seven artes liberales, or liberal arts, are the basis of medieval higher education. Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other academic knowledge without a score of at least three in this one.

The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)

Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The auctores are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the auctor, in his *logica vetus* and *logic nova*. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The auctor is Cicero, especially his *De Inventione*.

Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The auctor is Boethius, *De arithmetica*. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the auctor is Euclid, in his *Elementa*. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's *Optica* is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the auctor is Ptolemy, in the *Libri Almagesti*. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in *De Musica. Specialties: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music.* (Intelligence)

Civil and Canon Law: Civil Law is the law of the Roman Empire. Most local legal systems are based upon it (England being the notable exception), and when a law is needed to govern international relations, Civil Law is appealed to. The authority is Justinian's Digest. Canon Law is the law of the Church. It is important to Mythic Europe as it applies in all nations, governing the working of the church and some other areas, such as marriage. It is important to note that members of the clergy are only subject to canon law, not customary or civil law. Most high churchmen are skilled canonists, not theologians. Canon Law is made by Papal bulls (pronouncements), but the auctor is Gratian, in his *Decretum*. This skill covers the knowledge of both types of law. Specialties: laws and customs of a specific area, papal laws. (Intelligence)
