## Conjure the Sturdy Vine

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Leaf from a Vine (+3)

Grows 10 paces of vine from a moderate quantity of wood, or from fertile soil. The vine is extremely strong and pliable, suitable for use as rope. If the focus is available, it is planted in the ground, and the vine instantly grows from it.

## Trap of the Entwining Vines

R: Near/Far, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Leaf from a Vine (+1)

Causes strong, woody vines to grow rapidly from fertile earth. The vines cover a circle 2 paces across and reach 6 feet high. Anything caught within them is immobilized. To avoid the vines, the target must make a Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 9+. To break out requires a Strength stress roll of 12+ (allowed once a round). Someone not trapped can cut a trapped person free in two rounds, assuming proper tools. The vines weaken and wither to dust after an hour.

# Level 20

## Wall of Thorns

R: Near/Far, D: Sun/Perm, T: Str

Spell Focus: A Single Thorn (+1)

Within seconds, this spell creates a straight wall of woody, thorny bushes up to 20 paces long, 1 pace thick, and 4 paces high. The thorns, which are unnaturally resilient, have a +15 Soak and four Body levels (and are cut by edged weapons only). Bodily forcing one's way through the wall requires a Strength stress roll of 9+ and does +15 damage whether the attempt succeeds or fails. If the roll botches, an additional 5 points of damage are suffered. The wall grows out of existing bushes or fertile soil. A Climb stress roll of 9+ allows a character to scale the wall, but the character takes +10 damage in the process.

# Level 25

## Wall of Living Wood

R: Near/Far, D: Sun/Perm, T: Str

Spell Focus: An Oak Branch (+1)

A straight wall of living oak is created, growing quickly from nearby trees, other plant growth, or fertile earth. The wall is 20 paces long, 1 pace thick, and 5 paces high. It can be scaled with a Climb stress roll of 9+.

# Level 35

## The Bountiful Feast

R: Spec, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual

This ritual, which must be cast at noon on the day after the winter solstice, attempts to ensure that all crops that grow within its target will be healthy and fruitful. The spell protects against non-magical blight and other diseases. It can't control the weather or prevent others from harming crops, but it does cause crops to be healthier, larger, and tastier than they otherwise would be. The Boundary of this spell is the fields owned by those present at the ritual. Although food plants are affected most by this ritual, all plants are made healthier to some degree.
