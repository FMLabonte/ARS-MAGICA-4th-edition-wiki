## Rego Aquam Spells

### General

### Ward Against Faeries of the Waters

R: Near, D: Ring/Perm, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

No water faerie whose Faerie Might is equal to or less than the level of the spell can affect those targeted by the spell. Faeries cannot directly or indirectly break the magic circle, nor can they use ranged attacks or magic to affect those within it.

The star ruby is a rare gem that aids in controlling many types of entities. Seen from certain angles at night, the ring appears as a light blue dome.

### Level 5

### Cloak of the Duck's Feathers

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Duck's Feather (+3)

Makes water run off one object or creature, protecting the target and the target's apparel from dampness. The spell is broken if the target is submerged in water.

### Level 10

### Break the Oncoming Wave

R: Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Aquamarine Gem (+3)

Breaks all waves and torrents of water (including magical ones) as they come within 10 paces of you. The water either crashes to the ground or flows around you in a truly impressive display. The aquamarine gem has strong associations with water.

In Ferramentum of Verditius's version of this spell, the water breaks at precisely 10 paces, leaving a very clean line showing where the waves stopped. All of his spells may be recognized by their orderliness.

### Level 15

### Gift of the Floating Wood

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Piece of Wood (+3)

Lets any object or creature of Size +3 or smaller float in water.

### Push of the Gentle Wave

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Sliver from an Oar (+3)

A low wave is formed to propel a small boat slowly through the water. When casting this spell, you commonly make a pushing gesture. If a sliver from an oar is available, you throw it into the water behind the boat, and the wave originates from that spot.

In Silva of Merinita's version of this spell, the wave occasionally drifts or bobs about, as if it is happy and playful.

### Level 20

### Chaos of the Angry Waves

R: Far, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: An Emerald (+3)

Causes water to churn wildly, overturning small water craft and forcing Swim rolls at -6, in a circular area 20 paces across. The emerald has associations with water.

### Level 30

### Parting the Waves

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Bound

Spell Focus: A Vial of Water from the Sea (+1)

Parts a body of water, revealing a dry path 5 paces wide along the bottom.

### Pull of the Watery Grave

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Piece of a Boat Long Buried Below the Waves (+3)
