ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

You choose the Characteristics to be exchanged. If you cannot each contribute a Characteristic to the other (for instance, because all your familiar's Characteristics are lower than yours), you cannot take this bond quality. You can take this quality multiple times, but your Characteristic scores may be raised to no higher than +7 in this manner. Along with this bond quality, you each gain some mental trait, habit, or Personality Trait of the other.

**Primary Power**: Your familiar gains a new magical power related to your strongest magical Art, and you gain 2 levels in the magical Art most closely related to the familiar's strongest natural magical power (or its strongest natural ability if it has no natural magical powers). If the power the familiar gains affects the familiar only, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 10 or less, and it will cost the familiar 2 points of Magic Might to use; if the power allows the familiar to affect other things, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 10 or less, and it will cost the familiar 3 points of Magic Might to use. If the familiar has no Magic Might score, it can use the above powers three times a day and twice per day, respectively.

**Shared Ability**: You each either gain one Ability that the other possesses and gain it at the same score, or increase to that of the other's score a score in an Ability you already possess. Thus, one of you could gain a new Ability and the other increase one, each of you could increase a separate Ability that you both share at different scores, or both of you could gain a new Ability. You may take this bond quality more than once, each time sharing and/or increasing new Abilities. You each also gain one habit of the other, related somehow to the Ability score gained.

**Shared Languages**: Your familiar's speech becomes intelligible to people other than you (but is still poor). Your familiar only knows how to speak Latin or your native language—your choice. Likewise, you may speak with beasts of the same species as your familiar (for example, wolves, ravens, moles, deer). You each also gain some speech habit of the other.

**Shared Protection**: Ranged. The two of you are protected by each other's Magic Resistance, both getting the better of the two protections. Your familiar does not control your Parma Magica, but receives its benefits whenever you activate the defense. You each also gain a defensive habit of the other. This habit has no rule implications; it's just a tendency, like an instinct to immediately seek out shelter.

**Sympathetic Emotions**: When either of you feels an emotion, the other feels it too. Whenever one of you makes a Personality Trait roll the other gains the benefits or suffers the same effects of the Trait. Your familiar gains 1 Confidence point and you gain your familiar's strongest Personality Trait at the same level it has.

## +10 Bond Qualities

**Mental Communication**: Ranged. The two of you may communicate mentally with each other at will, sharing thoughts, images, and simple emotions. You each gain a Personality Trait of the other.

**Secondary Power**: Your familiar gains a new magical power related to any magical Art you wish, and you gain 4 levels in a magical Art closely related to one of the familiar's natural abilities or natural magical powers. If the power the familiar gains affects the familiar only, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 15 or less, and it will cost the familiar 1 point of Magic Might to use; if the power allows the familiar to affect other things, it must be equivalent to a spell of level 15 or less, and it will cost the familiar 2 points of Magic Might to use. If the familiar has no Magic Might score, the above powers it gains can be used four times a day or three times a day, respectively.

**Shared Senses**: Ranged. Each of you can use any one of the other's senses by making a Perception + Concentration simple roll of 9+, but you cannot both use this ability simultaneously. The one of you using the sense of the other cannot perceive his surroundings with the sense being borrowed, as it is being overridden. Anything that breaks the concentration of the one of you using this ability ends the ability's use. You each also gain some habit of the other, related to the other's particular sensory strengths (see "Tempering the Bond").

**Shared Speech**: Your familiar's speech becomes as good as human speech, completely clear and intelligible to people other than you. Your familiar knows all the human languages that you do. You may speak with all beasts that share the same general habitat (land, air, water, or underground) as your familiar. You each also gain a strong speech habit of the other, or your voices change completely.

**Transfer Fatigue**: Ranged. You may each take a Fatigue level for the other. The one that transfers the Fatigue level may not use this ability again until the recipient recovers his Fatigue level, though the recipient may use this ability at a later time to transfer a Fatigue level in the other direction. If transfer of the Fatigue level would knock the recipient unconscious, the transfer fails. You each also gain some sleeping habit of the other.

**Unlimited Bond**: The powers of your bond, including the powers of the three cords and all ranged bond qualities, work at any range.

## +15 Bond Qualities

**Shapechange**: Your familiar can shapechange into human form, and with an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+, you can shapechange into the form of the familiar's species. The familiar must expend 5 points of Magic Might to change, and you must expend a Fatigue level. (If your familiar has no Magic Might score, it must also expend a Fatigue level to change shape.) For each hour shapechanged, one who is shapechanged must make a Fatigue roll against an ease factor of 9. If the roll fails, he loses a Fatigue level and resumes normal form. One rendered unconscious, for whatever reason, the shapechanged individual resumes normal form. You each also gain one physical peculiarity of the other, which is very noticeable.

**Shared Magic**: Ranged. Your familiar gains a limited ability to use magic in your strongest Art, and you gain a limited ability to use one of the familiar's natural abilities or natural magical Powers. Your familiar may cast level 5 spontaneous spells related to your strongest Art, at the cost of 1 point of Magic Might each (or at the cost of a Fatigue level if the animal has no Magic Might score). You may, with an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+, use a specified power or natural ability of the familiar, at the cost of one Fatigue level per use.

**Transfer Wounds**: Ranged. You may each mystically take a wound for the other. Calculate damage normally. The amount exceeding the Soak score of the one receiving it is sent to the other. The one that transfers a wound cannot use this ability again until the recipient permanently heals the damage sent (so the damage cannot be healed simply through a temporary spell), though the recipient may use this power at a later time to transfer a wound in the other direction. If transfer of a wound would kill the recipient, the transfer fails.

## -5 Bond Qualities

**Exchange Flaws**: Your familiar gains one of your Flaws, and you gain a Flaw related to one of the familiar's natural or supernatural weaknesses.

**Independence**: Your familiar is unusually independent. It frequently acts of its own accord, even if you prefer otherwise, though you and your familiar always band together in times of need.

**Limited Bond**: The two of you gain most benefits of your bond only when you are close to each other. Any positive bond qualities marked as "ranged" are only in effect when the two of you are within 5 paces of each other. Negative bond qualities with a range still function within 100 paces.
