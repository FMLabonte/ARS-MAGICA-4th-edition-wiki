ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

Light Touch: You have especially good hand-eye coordination and great proficiency for using your hands in precise, fast ways. You gain +3 to all rolls involving subtle manipulation of objects (like picking pockets) and roll one less botch die than you normally would in such activities (minimum of one). This bonus does not apply to archery.

Luck: You perform well in situations where luck is more of a factor than skill or talent. You get +1 to +3 (storyguide's discretion) on rolls in such situations, depending upon how much luck is involved. You do well at games of chance, but may be labeled a cheater if you play them too often.

Magical Animal Companion: You are accompanied by a magical animal that's smart enough to follow your orders. The smaller and more innocuous the creature, the more intelligent it is. A ferret or crow is as intelligent as a human, a wolf is very cunning, and an animal the size of a horse is simply more intelligent than normal. If you wish, you may give your magical companion up to two points of Virtues, balanced with one Flaw point of your own. The creature has a Magic Might score of 10 - Size.

Mentor: A person of some importance, wealth, or wisdom has taken an interest in your life, and at times provides you with material aid and advice. However, at some point your mentor may have a small favor to ask of you. He might not necessarily like your relationship with the covenant—perhaps you must keep it a secret.

Patron: An influential person provides you with materials and a handsome (by medieval standards) salary, in return for services of some kind. The relationship with your patron is one of business more than friendship, and you may occasionally have to walk on eggshells to avoid any unacceptable behavior, whether real or imagined.

Piercing Gaze: By staring intently at people you make them feel uneasy, as if you are peering into their souls. Those with ulterior motives, uneasy consciences, or lying tongues must make rolls against an appropriate Personality Trait, Guile, or whatever the storyguide deems appropriate, to remain calm. Furthermore, you gain a +3 to rolls involving intimidation. Faeries and demons are unfazed by your power.

Reserves of Strength: Once per day, when in need, you can perform an incredible feat of strength. For the duration of the action, add +3 to your effective Strength score. Afterwards, though, you must make two Fatigue rolls.

Skinchanger: You have a magical cloak, animal skin or similar item made from an animal. While in physical contact with it, you may transform into the form of the animal represented by the item. The transformation takes one full round, and you retain both intelligence and sentience while in animal form. Clothing and possessions (save the animal item) do not transform, and you may be seen as a transformed human with InIm 20 or similar spells. If the item is stolen, the new owner has a arcane connection to you, and you may not transform until the item is retrieved. Skinchangers may transform into any nonmagical animal between Size -5 (robin) and Size +2 (bear). The character has the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 252), except that +3 is added to the character's Soak score (in animal form only).

Superior Armaments: You can start with expensive arms and armor.

Temporal Influence: Through blood or a position of trust, you enjoy some political weight in society. You have the ear of a leader and may yourself lead common folk at times, if they respect your position. The more influence you have, the more responsibility, and the harder it is to work unopposed with magi.

True Love: You have found the one person meant for you in all of creation, and the bond between the two of you cannot be sundered. Whenever you are suffering, in danger, or dejected, the thought of your love will give you strength to persevere. Thus, you may add +3 to appropriate Personality Trait rolls, and add additional bonuses as

allowed by the storyteller (never in excess of +3) to activities that will return you to your love, or save her life. In dire need, she may even come to rescue you. On the other hand, you are tied to your lover, to whom you must return frequently. If you do not, you may suffer penalties to most actions requiring spirit due to melancholy. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it.

Visions: You often see images related to emotionally or magically laden events. A vision might be of the past, a possible future, or a distant occurrence, and is often symbolic or confusing. Visions usually come to you at quiet times in places connected with a powerful emotional or magical event, such as the site of a patricide or diabolic sacrifice. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Visions 1, which can be improved with experience points. When you wish to use this Talent, you tell the storyguide what specifically you would like to have a vision regarding. The storyguide assigns an ease factor based on the difficulty of gaining information about the topic. The storyguide should then make the roll in secret—on a botch, incorrect information is divulged.

Withstand Magic (companions and grogs): You are innately nonmagical and can resist many spell effects. You have a +6 bonus to natural resistance rolls against spells, faerie powers, and infernal powers. This bonus also applies to your Soak score against damage from spells. You resist good magic as well, and suffer a -6 penalty on any roll to determine if a beneficial spell (like healing) affects you. This Virtue does not apply to the effects of Exceptional Talents, nor does it protect against powers of the Dominion. You can have no magical powers.
