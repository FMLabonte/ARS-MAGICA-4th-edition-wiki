THE ART OF MAGIC

Serfs are not quite slaves, since they are bound to the land rather than a person, though their lord claims ownership of their work and its products. Serfs must give the lord goods in exchange for living on and farming the land they surrendered; it is an indentured servitude whose term never ends. They must also farm the lord's land before their own, and must provide labor for the lord's building projects, wars, and household. However, serfs cannot be bought, sold, or killed without legal justification.

Serfs' bodies are their own, but their deeds are not. They must care for themselves, as well or as poorly as they can, with what their lord allows them. For every act outside the ordinary bounds of their work, they must have their lord's blessing. Serfs who break the rules are dead serfs. On the other hand, lords who lawlessly destroy those they are bound by tradition to protect, or who raise their serfs' obligations above traditional levels, can be punished by their overlord.

## Free Peasants

Free peasants are bound to no one. They, or their ancestors, may be former serfs who have been freed. In some extraordinary circumstances, such people's ancestors never became serfs. Free peasants have the right to do whatever they please whenever they want to, with only two restrictions: they must not take on the privileges of their betters; and they must, each year, pay rent to the lord of the land they farm—or be sent packing.

Like serfs, free peasants have a contract to care for their landlord, as well as his or her lands and household, in exchange for protection. Unlike serfs, though, free peasants can choose to risk starvation by doing as they please. Freedom is no less cherished when its profits are not tangible.

## The Peasants' Contribution

Most of the world's great works came from commoners' hands. Free peasants built London and Paris, and bought the cities' right to self-rule in the same way they bought their own freedom. The knight's proud sword came from the blacksmith's forge in the humble village at the foot of the castle. Barbers, lawyers, artists, craftspeople, and city guards are all peasants. The great cathedrals, monuments to the glory of God, were fashioned by toiling masons. The gold of kings was acquired by the clever minds and skilled hands of merchants and weavers, vintners and tradespeople.

Many among the noble class of the time deeply resent peasant wealth and power, when the power of their own land and sword is fading. Yet most peasants remain farmers,

scraping a living together by the toil of their hands and the sweat of their brows. Even those who dwell in towns usually keep fields and flocks just outside the city walls. Short lives, high rents, and heavy taxes keep most peasants at the bottom of society. Thus, though peasants in theory have the ability to rise above their current social position, that transcendence is still centuries away.

## Cities

In the golden ages of long ago the Roman Empire had scores of great cities all over Europe and beyond. Whether it was through the decadence of the Romans (as some claim) or by the hand of God (according to others), that brilliant, though flawed, era came to an end. The Dark Ages fell across Europe with the destruction of almost all the Roman cities and the civilization they nurtured. Even the greatest centers of the past, such as Rome and London, collapsed into decay as most of the inhabitants left to seek safer homes. But the early 13th century stands at the threshold of a new flourishing of urban life in Western Europe.

## Rise of the Medieval City

For centuries after the fall of Rome, the only settlements in northern Europe were tiny villages clustered close to the castles of the nobles, hiding from the barbarians, Vikings, and others who sought to destroy order and peace. Over time, as the barbarians were driven off or civilized, merchants began to travel the newly safe roads once again, trade fairs sprang up outside many of the larger castles, and some free peasants began to return to the long-deserted cities.

Taxing the fairs often brought a noble more silver and gold than extracting meager payments from overburdened peasants. So, in return for the greater profit gained from a permanent center of trade, some nobles granted the inhabitants of trading towns the right to freedom and self-government. Others were forced to do so when angry townspeople took up arms against oppressive taxation. Whatever the reason, lords usually signed charters with the inhabitants of towns, promising the townspeople certain rights in return for taxes.

From these humble beginnings many independent towns and cities were born. Now, in 1220, there are hundreds of towns of more than 1,000 inhabitants: London has about 25,000; Paris and Genoa boast over 50,000; Milan and
