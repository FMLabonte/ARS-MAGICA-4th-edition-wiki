CHAPTER III

HERMETIC MAGIC

be aided in this manner, since the extra time for preparation is already accounted for in the time to cast the spell.

You spend one minute per 5 levels of the spell in preparation, considering the symbols you are about to use, thinking about the laws of magic, and carefully gathering the energy that powers the spell. (When taking extra care with a spontaneous spell, spend one minute per 5 levels of the spell you hope to cast. You cannot then cast a spell higher than this level.) When the preparation time is over, you cast the spell, adding your Concentration score to your spell roll. In addition, if you are making a stress roll, you may reduce the number of botch dice, if any, by one (but never below one).

## Spell Foci

Most formulaic spells have certain special ingredients, known as spell foci, that aid in their casting and that supply some of the magical energy needed to cast them. When you use the focus specified in the description of a spell, you gain the specified bonus to your roll when casting the spell. Failing to use these foci incurs no ill effects or penalties, unless the spell description notes them as a requirement, as in the case of certain powerful spells. Failing to use a specified mandatory focus results in failure of the spell.

Note that a focus created through magic (probably by a Creo spell) offers no spellcasting bonus unless it is made permanent through the use of raw vis. Otherwise, a focus must only exist naturally to be functional; it does not have to possess magical properties.

Unless a spell's description states otherwise, spell foci continue to exist after the casting of a spell and can be used over and over.

## Using Raw Vis

As explained in the "Raw Vis" section (page 67), raw vis is magical power in physical form. It is required to cast ritual spells, and you can use it to strengthen spells. With spontaneous spells, your only use for raw vis is to increase your spell roll (and thus increase the level of the resulting spell). With formulaic and ritual spells, you may use raw vis to extend range, extend duration, or increase your spell roll. You must always use vis that is of the same Form or Technique as the spell you are casting with it, and you must be physically touching the substance within which raw vis is contained in order to use it.

When you choose to use raw vis, you must determine the number of pawns that are to be invested in the magical activity before you initiate it. Once you have established the

number, you cannot change it, and if the spell is disrupted, fails, or botches, all the vis you dedicated to it is lost. When using vis to increase your spell roll, add +5 to the roll for every pawn of vis expended. When casting spontaneous spells, you add this bonus before the roll is divided. If you want to increase the range or duration of a formulaic or ritual spell (to the amount listed after the slash in the description), you expend one pawn of raw vis per 5 levels of the spell or fraction thereof. If you wish to extend both range and duration, you must expend vis for both. Note that using raw vis to strengthen a spell is tricky, and you must always roll a stress die when strengthening a spell with vis, even if you have mastered the spell in question. In addition, if you roll a zero, you must roll one extra botch die per pawn of vis expended.

There are limits to the amount of vis you can utilize at one time. Your highest applicable Art score is the maximum number of pawns of vis you may invest into a single round of magical action or the initial casting of a given spell. Furthermore, you cannot spend more pawns of a given type of vis than you have score in that art. For example, if a magus with Perdo 10 and Mentem 6 cast a Perdo Mentem spell, he could use up to 10 pawns of Perdo vis, or up to 6 pawns of Mentem vis. He could also choose to use Perdo vis and Mentem vis in combination, as long as the total number of pawns does not exceed 10 and the number of pawns of Mentem vis does not exceed 6.

For laboratory activities, Vim + Magic Theory is the limit to the number of pawns of vis (regardless of type) that you may use in one season. Vim is used because it's representative of magic as a whole, so it imposes a limit on the amount of magic you can work with over an extended period.

If you try to use more vis than your appropriate Art or Vim score allows, whether you are casting a spell or working in the lab, the extra points are used up, but you do not gain any benefit from them. They do not count towards the action attempted, but you still have to roll one extra botch die per pawn of vis expended.

At the storyguide's option, the uncontrolled magical power that you release may affect your surroundings, causing magical side effects in proportion to the amount of uncontrolled vis expended.

## Casting a Spell While Maintaining Another

Certain spells require that you maintain concentration on them to sustain their effect. It is possible to cast another spell while maintaining this concentration, but it is difficult and risks causing the spell already in effect to fail.
