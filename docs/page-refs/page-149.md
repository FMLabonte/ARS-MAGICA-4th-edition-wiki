CHAPTER V

SPELLS

likely to follow the target's. Bishops, dukes, generals, and magi are not affected by this spell unless it is cast on someone of status near to their own. Even then, such figures are allowed to attempt to make an Intelligence stress roll of  $15+$  to resist.

The violet amethyst is commonly made into a brooch or clasp. While casting the spell, usually you give it to the target of the spell to wear and make a shallow bow. Violet amethyst is the stone of Jupiter, and gives political power and ascendancy over the masses.

# Level 25

# Incantation of Summoning the Dead

R: Reach/Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Black Onyx (+1)

Calls up a person's ghost. You must be on the spot where the person died, or must have the corpse. Alternatively, you can summon any ghost that haunts the area you are in, if you know the ghost's full name, according to the Law of Names. Those buried by Church ceremony and those have who gone straight to heaven (that is, saints and crusaders, as opposed to the normal folk who must wait for a time before going on) are not available for summoning.

# Level 40

# Enslave the Mortal Mind

R: Eye/Near; D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Enables you to completely control the loyalty, emotions, desires, interests, and long-term activities of any person. The target gets one chance to resist by making a Stamina + Intelligence stress roll of  $12+$ . Further resistance rolls are possible when your control makes the victim do things strongly at odds with his or her former personality.

# The Shrouded Glen

R: Per, D: Moon/Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Enchants the Boundary in which the ritual is cast so that anyone moving towards it is subtly diverted, effectively keeping the place from being discovered accidentally. Anyone not actively searching for the hidden place never finds it. Those actively searching can find the place by making a Perception stress roll of  $12+$  (allowed once per day). Searchers get a  $+6$  bonus for having an accurate map. If the surrounding terrain is more difficult to search than the average forest, the ease factor increases. Likewise, the ease factor drops if the terrain is more open than a forest, and completely open terrain is unsuitable for this spell. Once a searcher spots the hidden place, the spell does not prevent approach. Those who are present for the ritual are unaffected by the spell. This spell mimics the properties of many faerie forests.

# Level 55

# Exchange of the Two Minds

R: Touch, D: Year/Perm, T: Spec, Ritual

This spell switches the minds (but not the souls) of two creatures. A new body greatly confuses those who are unprepared for the shock, and even those who are ready take a day to adjust completely. Magi who transport their own minds into younger, healthier bodies usually find that having a strong body entails having powerful passions that interfere with the clear thinking needed to pursue the magical Arts.

Both people involved must make a Stamina stress roll of  $3+$ , rolled before the switch is made, to survive the transfer.

# Terram Spells

Terram spells, in addition to covering earth, stone, clay, metal, and glass, can sometimes affect inanimate objects in general. For instance, Wielding the Invisible Sling (ReTe 10) throws all manner of nonliving things.

Though Terram spells affect all manner of solid objects, it is harder to affect certain materials: Here, in increasing order of difficulty, are the materials Terram spells affect: earth (sand, dirt, mud), clay, stone, glass, metal, gemstones. Each level of difficulty does not necessarily represent an increase in one level of magnitude.

# Creo Terram Guidelines

Creating earth in an elaborate shape or with some unnatural property is one level of magnitude higher than the listed guidelines.

Wizard's sigils commonly visible in Creo Terram spells involve the object created being bizarre in some way, such as dirt being a specific color or texture.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

Level 5: Create an amount of sand, dirt, mud, or clay.

Level 10: Create an amount of stone or glass.

Level 15: Create an amount of metal or a rough gemstone.

Level 20: Create an amount of polished gemstone.
