CHAPTER V
SPELLS
115

# Level 15

## Incantation of Putrid Wine

R: Reach/Far, D: Sun/Inst, T: Room

Spell Focus: Venom from a Spider (+1)

Makes all liquids within the target room vile, malodorous, and mildly poisonous (+5 damage). The room where this spell is cast may not lose the stench for weeks or months.

## Breath of Winter

R: Touch/Sight, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Beryl (+5)

Requisite: Terram

Turns a circle of water up to 5 paces across into snow. Beryl is a gem associated with water.

# Level 20

# Level 25

## Ice of Drowning

R: Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Piece of Ice from a Frozen Ocean (+3)

Requisites: Terram, Rego

Fills water in a circle 10 paces across with large, jagged chunks of ice that pound against anything on the water's surface. The ice can punch holes in small boats but does not damage ships. Any swimmers in the area take +15 damage, and suffer -6 and two extra botch checks on Swim rolls. If a piece of ice from waters north of England is available, it is thrown into the water where the spell is cast.

# Level 30

## Bridge of Frost

R: Near, D: Sun, T: Spec.

Spell Focus: Beryl (+3)

Requisite: Terram

Causes a thick layer of frost (firm enough to walk on) to form on the surface of a body of water. The frost can take any shape up to 15 paces in any direction. The bridge collapses after 6 to 15 creatures have crossed over it (roll a simple die +5). Only the storyguide knows the number of creatures that can cross.

In Cralian of Tremere's version of this spell, the frost is so crystal clear that it can hardly be seen. All of his spells are very subtle.

# Level 55

## Vile Water of Sterility

R: Touch, D: Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

Spell Focus: Venom from a Dragon (+5)

Ruins a body of water up to the size of a small lake, making it unfit for natural habitation and consumption. The water becomes dark and murky, and noxious fumes emanate from it. Vegetation on the banks either dies or becomes corrupt. Nearby trees become gnarled and blackened, and land animals flee the area. If the venom from a dragon is available, a drop is let into the lake. The corruption begins there, and is always strongest at that spot.

# Perdo Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Instant, and basic target is Small.

As magnitudes in these spells rise, the destruction caused becomes more subtle, or more pervasive. Sigils commonly seen in Perdo Aquam spells usually involve destruction in some specific way.

Level 5: Destroy a liquid (requisites may be required).

Level 15: Destroy one property of a liquid (like alcohol's ability to intoxicate or sea water's saltiness).

Level 20: Destroy a Small spring, so that it never flows again.

Level 40: Destroy a lake, drying the bed and preventing water from ever naturally pooling there (channels for runoff are also created)—Ritual.

# Perdo Aquam Spells

# Level 10

## Parching Wind

R: Reach/Near, D: Inst, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Dust (+1)

Removes all water from any inanimate object of Size -1 or less, including plants (with a Herbam requisite), possibly making the object brittle and fragile. A pinch of dust can be tossed at the target, driving water from it.

# Level 20

## Curse of the Desert

R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Breeze from a Desert (+3)

Removes most of the fluid from the target's body, doing +15 damage, which can only be Soaked with Stamina + Size. The target must drink within an hour of being struck with this spell, or it dies. Casting requisites are Animál for beasts, and Corpus for humans. If you have managed to trap a breeze from a desert, you open the container in which it is carried while casting the spell; the breeze will blow towards the victim, draining him or her of fluid.

# Level 35

## Calling the Odious Drought

R: Touch, D: Year/Perm, T: Bound, Ritual
