ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

**Obsessed:** You are fixated on some prized object, action, or ideal. This interferes with your accomplishment of more immediate tasks. Examples might include obsessive protection of magi to the point that you attack those who insult them, or obsessive neatness where you keep yourself spotless and deride those who do not.

**Offensive To Animals:** (companions and grogs only): You are somehow disturbing to animals. Horses do not let you ride them, and dogs growl or cower in your presence. People may well suspect you of being a wizard or Devil-worshipper.

**Oversensitive:** Something that others find merely unpleasant you consider intolerable. Examples might include an oversensitivity to disrespect, to slovenliness, or to impiety. If you are the violent type, you may start fights with those who offend you.

**Poor Armaments:** You can only have inexpensive arms and armor, and can only have inexpensive equipment relevant to your occupation.

**Poor Eyesight:** Bleary vision impedes your performance. Rolls involving sight, including rolls to attack and defend, are at $-3$. New environments are disorienting and perhaps frightening for you. This flaw can be combined with Missing Eye (above), but the penalties are cumulative.

**Poor Hearing:** Subtract 3 from rolls involving hearing. Speech that is hard for others to understand because of language, dialect, or accent is almost impossible for you to follow. You often pretend to be listening to people when in fact you are not.

**Poor Memory** (companions and grogs): You have a very hard time recalling one type of thing, such as names, faces, or places. When attempting to remember such an item, you must make a stress roll of $6+$ to succeed. You get $-3$ on any other memory-related rolls. On a botch, you recall incorrectly but are convinced you have the right information. For best effect, the storyguide should make recollection rolls secretly.

**Reclusive:** You prefer to do things on your own, and do not like being interrupted. You feel that an intrusion by another upon your time is unnecessary at best, and an insult at worst. You have a Personality Trait of Reclusive $+3$. If someone interrupts you, make a stress roll against this Trait; on a $6+$, you rudely show them the door. If you botch, you lose your temper completely, while a multiple botch likely results in violence as you try to get rid of the pest.

**Short Attention Span** (companions and grogs): You have trouble concentrating, which makes it hard to learn anything. You must earn double the normal experience points to raise your Knowledge Abilities, and expend twice as much to buy them in the first place. Keeping watch, listening to complex orders, following the plot of a story, or performing other such tasks that require continued attention are usually not within your ability.

**Simple-Minded:** You can only think about one thing at a time—guarding the bridge, hunting for a missing ring, or hiding in the trees for example. You become easily confused unless others give you very clear instructions. When unexpected circumstances pop up, you find them difficult to deal with.

**Social Handicap** (companions and grogs): You have some trait that keeps you from interacting easily with other people. This impairs your dealings with most of society, causing penalties of $-3$ on appropriate rolls. Examples include morose temperament, unworldliness, an unpleasant odor, or outspoken atheism.

**Soft-Hearted:** You cannot bear to witness suffering, and causing it brings you sleepless nights. Even the deaths of enemies are painful for you. You avoid danger and try to keep your friends out of it as well. Life and health mean so much that you would rather give up important goals than let another person risk combat. You are easily moved by song and story.

**Tainted With Evil** (magi): An air of corruption surrounds you as a result of something you, your parens, or your ancestors did. Others naturally feel very ill at ease around you, and can easily grow to hate you. Gaining a positive Reputation is impossible. Magi do not react as strongly to this attribute as normal people.

**Uncommon Fear:** Something that others find innocuous or even pleasant makes you nervous, edgy, and unable to concentrate. If you are prone to violence, you might respond by attacking or destroying the feared thing, but only if you cannot escape its presence. The object of your fear is not something you're likely to meet on a daily basis. Examples include wild animals, strange sounds, and clergy.

**Weakness:** You have a soft spot for some object or person. In the face of this, all else is unimportant: promises are forgotten, duties neglected, and common sense cast to the winds. Examples include poets and storytellers, food, flattery, or a pretty face.

**Weak-Willed:** You look to others for guidance rather than to yourself. Those who try to fool, intimidate, or manipulate you gain $+3$ to their rolls. What you need more than anything else is to find someone you can trust.

## -2 Flows

**Clumsy:** You are not very graceful and tend to drop things—you are at a $-3$ in all related rolls. Furthermore, roll an extra botch die when taking actions related to Dexterity. Roleplay your clumsiness.
