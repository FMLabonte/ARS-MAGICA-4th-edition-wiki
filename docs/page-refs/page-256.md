# Sainela, Negotiator of the Middle Echelons

This devil was an envoy between two powerful Hellish fiefdoms when a subtle diplomatic mission blew up in her face. As a result she lost her position and is now exiled to the mortal world, stripped of most of her usual powers. Rather than brood the centuries away, Sainela has decided to return to work as a mediator between opposed forces—humanity and devilkind. If her efforts earn the occasional soul along the way, so much the better.

Sainela's specialty is in dealing with people who are not horribly distressed by talking frankly with a demon, such as magi. She is reasonable, patient, even-tempered and quite sophisticated, with a passion for music, art, and philosophy. However, her actual goal is to corrupt those she deals with, through "infernal diplomacy."

A common ploy to nudge innocent souls closer to Hell is offering the target a chance to speak with the shade of some ancient scholar. This is actually a cruel hoax, with lesser demons pretending to be the summoned shade. The target's agreement is a mark in Sainela's favor come Judgment Day, regardless of the reality of the "summoning." Any attempt to disturb a resting soul offends Heaven.

Sainela appears as a stylishly-dressed young woman with a forceful demeanor. Though it is not usually obvious, she also has a short, red, barbed tail. She disappears in a cloud of sweet-smelling, lavender smoke rather than stay and fight.

Adventure Seed: Sainela accepts the task of corrupting the covenant or one of its magi. At first she offers seemingly innocuous favors, posing as a young noblewoman, then arranges situations in which the characters need her help. Her goal is for them to accept demons rather than fear them. As she knows she has centuries to accomplish her mission, she's in no hurry.

Force Words, CrMe 20, 2 points: Sainela can put up to a dozen words into someone's mouth. The target might be surprised to utter these words, but may be proud enough to defend what they say rather than take them back.

Hermetic Spells, special, 1 point: Any Mentem spells up to level 10, and any other spells at up to level 5.

Create, Cr—x, 5 points: Creates impermanent items, such as weapons, ropes, tents, and gold. She uses this power to offer people the things they most desire. Created items disappear at the next full moon. The Form and level depend on what is created.

# Faeries

Faeries are the most diverse and enigmatic of all supernatural beings. Their strength lies in their inherent magical nature, not in their muscle, though some have supernatural strength. Most rely on illusion, deception and other forms of magic to protect themselves.

The goals of faeries are largely incomprehensible to mortals. They lack any need for food and shelter (indeed, none of them ever die or grow old), so are often motivated by a simple desire to amuse themselves. Faeries spend much of their time in games of "let's pretend." They seem fascinated by humanity and play out elaborate games with strict rules, taking on the roles of kings, queens, courtiers, jesters, and knights. Often, the rules require that they do not use powers beyond what their roles permit.

It's not easy to put faeries in a mortal context. Think of them as the wild opposites of Mythic Europe's mundane folk. They are the restless, endlessly creative, playful, unfathomable, and unleashed reflection of stolid humanity. They are closest to the simple, honest people who realize on an intuitive level that there is much within the world that they do not understand and never will. For more information on faeries, you might want to refer to the Ars Magica supplement Faeries.
