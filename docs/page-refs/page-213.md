CHAPTER X
MYTHIC EUROPE
213

historical Europe is applicable. The basic dates are the same, the same nobles rule, and the same popes issue decrees.

In fact, exactly how much Mythic Europe deviates from historical Europe is something that each storyguide should determine for himself. The dimensions of Mythic Europe can be as grand or as mundane as you like. The nature of Mythic Europe depends on your answer to the question: What if things really were the way medieval people believed them to be? Its scope and scale depends on how willing you are to accept medieval legend . . . and which legends you choose to accept.

You can create an incredibly fantastic world by simply decreeing that everything people believed in is true, or you can create a world so faithful to "reality" that roleplaying in it is like being in a historical novel. Whether your game setting is historically accurate or a fantastic excursion, remember that it's your job as storyguide to insure that the world is wondrous and vibrant with imagination.

# Anno Domini 1220

We have set Ars Magica 4th Edition in the year 1220. The thirteenth century is a vibrant, lively time in medieval history, a time of drama, conflict and change in culture, politics, religion, and intellectual life. England, united under one king, is creating a model for the national monarchies of Europe's future. On the opposite end of the continent, the Mongols will soon threaten eastern Europe; in 1220 they take the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. The Fifth Crusade (1217-1221) is presently taking place in Egypt. Contact with Islam through the Crusades, the reconquest of Iberia, and peaceful trade, has rewarded Europe with a wealth of knowledge. It has also renewed Europe's familiarity with the wisdom of ancient Greeks such as Aristotle and Galen. Thinkers such as Peter Abelard (1079-1142) led the charge in challenging the intellectual status quo in the great universities, and the debate continues. Gothic architecture, featuring flying buttresses and beautiful stained glass windows, defines the magnificent cathedrals being built across Europe. Reformers such as Saint Francis of Assissi (1181-1226) and Saint Dominic (1170-1221) are leading the renewal of Christianity from within, while Cathar heretics have rejected the Church and now suffer her bitter reprisals. In southern France, living alongside the Cathars, troubadours have created the idea of romantic love.

By picking one year, we can focus on specific information—events, rulers, and so forth—to give you one snapshot of Mythic Europe. There is no reason you need to be limited to this year (or this century) for your own saga. Your

covenant could be contemporary with Charlemagne or Chaucer, if it pleases you.

# Geography

You will recognize many of the lands of Mythic Europe as the names of countries today. However, do not be deceived by the similarity, for in Mythic Europe the modern nation-state has not yet come to be. Where the modern nation typically has a government that rules a people with a common language and ethnic background, medieval "states" are confusing and heterogeneous. In theory, most of the rulers of Europe owe allegiance to the Pope, in a temporal as well as a spiritual sense. In turn, lesser rulers owe fealty to the great monarchs. In practice, things are changing constantly: kings defy popes and emperors, barons revolt against their overlords, and often one noble owes loyalty to two overlords—and has to choose sides when war breaks out between them.

Bloodlines and raw military power, not elections or popularity, determine succession; marriages among the nobility and royalty are usually matters of politics, not romance. (One courtly writer, Andreas Capellanus, went so far as to assert that marriage and romantic love were fundamentally incompatible.) Through inheritance, conquest, and colonization it is not unusual for a land's ruler not to speak the local language, or for two or more vernacular tongues to live side by side (plus, of course, the Latin spoken by the clergy and the educated in much of Europe).

Consider the kings of England. William, Duke of Normandy, was a vassal of the king of France—and frequently his opponent in battle. As a Norman, he was descended from Viking invaders. William conquered England in 1066, and installed his loyal, French-speaking Norman followers as lords over its lands. The marriage of the future Henry II to Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152 gave the Norman kings control over more of France than the French king had (Henry was already Duke of Normandy and soon to be Count of Anjou and Maine). Henry's sons fought against him and each other, and the wily French king Philip Augustus played one against the other to his own advantage. England's Richard I, obsessed with the Third Crusade and his interminable wars on the continent, scarcely set foot in England. Only with the decline of their French holdings do the English kings begin to think of themselves as English kings first, and continental European lords second.
