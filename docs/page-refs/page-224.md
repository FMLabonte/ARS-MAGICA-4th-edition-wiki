ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

so that the clergy are free to deal with God, and the nobles are free to fight their wars. Even though this work makes everyone else's achievements possible, it is considered the most ignoble of tasks, allotted to the most inferior of humanity. Disease, malnutrition, crop failure, and heavy taxation are the peasant's usual lot.

The upper classes believe that God created their stations and filled them with appropriate people. Thus, gratitude to the laboring class is not a consideration. Just as God decrees a person's social position, so too does He restrict its members: inequality is ordained.

The peasant is bound to his or her superiors by a social contract: "If you fight to keep me safe, I'll feed you. If you do your best to save my soul, I'll feed you." However, peasants have rights as well as responsibilities. They have the same chance of salvation as cardinal or king, and therefore have the same access to the blessings of the Church: baptism, consecration, last rites, and Christian burial. They also are entitled to decent treatment and full protection from their superiors, though what they actually get depends on the mercy of their lord and the allegiances of the local clergy.

Needless to say, the rights of the peasants are not always observed. However, for the upper classes to break the contract is to invite the peasantry to do the same. Every time a noble tramples the fields on a hunt, or ravages the countryside in a needless war, the peasants take note. Every time a parish priest breaks his oath of chastity, or a mendicant order buys cloth-of-gold, the peasants remember. The prospect of a peasant revolt haunts every abusive noble and hypocritical cleric, though in truth, most peasants are very loyal to their lords.

## Those Who Pray

The second great class of people in Mythic Europe is the clergy. The social bargain demands they do the work of mind and spirit. In earlier times, saving souls was their only purpose, but over time, priests, monks, and nuns assumed other important tasks.

The first of these is to control and administer the social order. God created society, they argue, so God's representatives should run it. When peasants seek to overreach their limits, parish priests remind them that their lot is God's will. When nobles fight each other in useless wars, the bishops chasten them with their divinely ordained responsibility to protect the land against invaders, not neighbors. Disobedient kings are reminded that they rule by the will of God, which is known only to the pope.

The second task is to manage thinking. Excessive thought is dangerous for those not assigned to it; it makes them aware of the injustices of life, which can lead to social turmoil. Peasants are supposed to be good farmers. Nobles are supposed to be good warriors. Neither group should have to think any more than necessary—it's not their job. Saracens, pagans, Jews, and magi are doubly damned, for their thoughts are not only blasphemous, but in defiance of God's order.

A few clergy are so certain of their righteousness that they defy temporal laws, establishing their own "divinely sanctioned" order. By putting a price on absolution from sin, popes take bribes to assure a peaceful afterlife. Cardinals, abbots, and abbesses scheme for political power and control of lands. How long such practices are accepted depends upon the moral outrage of society, or of the few who have power to intimidate the priestly class.

The clergy are divided by an internal war, one which has been brewing for some time. On one side are those who believe their first task is the most important; they are the defenders of order, the enforcers of orthodoxy. When this means restraining mad nobles or rooting out diabolists, these clergy accept the task and are considered heroes. Sometimes, though, this requires excommunicating a noble with a new idea or suppressing magi, even benevolent ones. In such cases, these clergy are seen as oppressors.

On the other side of the struggle are those who seek knowledge above all else. They are frequently the attackers of orthodoxy, and fight the bigotry that too often arises with the emergence of anything new and different. For these clergy, "It's God's will" is no answer to any injustice. They say God made people with the power to think for themselves. Such ideas run the constant risk of being labeled heresy.

## Those Who War

The third great class is the nobility. Their job is to protect society and maintain order. Every noble has an ancestor who was a barbarian chief, whom the common people supported in return for the power of the leader's sword. These ancient warriors passed their station down to their descendants, including the right to bear arms and to be supported by the common people, and the obligation to protect commoners in return.

Every noble wealthy and powerful enough to own a large tract of land keeps a house there to store the arms, armor, animals, and equipment of war. In the early days, when war was a constant feature of life, the noble house was little more than a stone fort. Now nobles demonstrate their
