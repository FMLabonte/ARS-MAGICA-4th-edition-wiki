## The Schism War

Just after the turn of the millennium, open conflict broke out within the Order, a prolonged series of skirmishes, battles, and assassinations that have come to be known as the Schism War.

Some houses and magi wanted to restrict the interaction among the houses so that corruption in one House would not lead to the downfall of others. The corruption of House Tytalus was, no doubt, the main cause for this paranoia, but intrigue, competition, and skirmishing in general added to the atmosphere of distrust. Differences of opinion turned into frequent Wizard Wars and raids.

The confusion led to a free-for-all, and old feuds came alive. Sides shifted continually, and fighting took many lives. Some houses retreated to avoid the violence, while others increased their violent activities to deter attackers or just to pursue personal grudges amid the chaos. The quaesitores lost effective power as the magi stopped obeying their orders, and it looked to most as if the Order of Hermes was about to fall.

Then House Tremere declared war on House Diedne. House Diedne, composed of descendants of the Druids, had always been distant from the other houses, and it was generally distrusted. Tremere's primus, Cercistum, called on House Flambeau to help rid the Order of these troublemakers and their exotic traditions. The Flambeau magi joined in the battle with relish. The quaesitores, seeing a chance to regain power, backed House Tremere and declared House Diedne renounced. Most of the other houses retreated for safety, but many individual magi with grudges to settle joined the assault.

House Diedne was entirely eliminated, but its leaders were never found. The magi of the day hoped that the far-reaching spells they had used had killed them, but many suspected that the leaders of House Diedne had retreated into a faerie forest. If that is the case, they might return at any time, bent on revenge.

With House Diedne destroyed, the Schism War was over. The quaesitores insisted on settling all remaining conflicts peacefully, and most magi were eager to stop fighting once they had seen the destruction that can result from an all-out war among the magi.

## The Code of Hermes

All magi swear to uphold the Code of Hermes, just as Bonisagus did at the founding of the Order. All of the traditions, laws, and rules of the Order originate with the Code. The punishment for breaking the Code is proscribed within it—death—but in practice, magi usually agree to lesser penalties, especially when the violations are of the Peripheral Code rather than the Code proper. Nevertheless, when an infraction warrants death, a Wizards' March is called. Upon declaration of the Wizards' March, the target is no longer protected by the Code, and members of the Order are called upon to find and slay the transgressor. Those participating in a magus's destruction are free to plunder his resources, so there is rarely a shortage of willing executioners.

## The Code

The Code of Hermes (also called the Hermetic Oath), first sworn by Bonisagus, can be found on the next page. Since he was the first to swear it, his name is recorded whenever it is written down. There is a slight difference between the Code that members of House Bonisagus swear and the Code that members of other houses swear. The difference is marked.

## The Peripheral Code

The Peripheral Code consists of the body of rulings made by magi in council since the beginning of the Order. Although the laws and rules of the Peripheral Code are voluminous, they are also quite important. They provide precedents and lay out precisely what magi may and may not do. Questions about familiars, apprentices, the formation of covenants, exactly how magi may relate with mundane powers, how Wizard War may be waged, and the like are all covered in one form or another.
