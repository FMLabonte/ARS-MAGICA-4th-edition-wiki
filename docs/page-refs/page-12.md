ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

I waited for the beast to come after me, but it must have thought that I died in the inferno. After a few hours, I made my way to Ungulus and told them what had happened. Flavius at least had some sympathy, and sent me back to Voluntas by magic. There, I found my mistress. She was badly injured, but the magic that she had cast on herself had taken her back to her lab when the injuries became too severe, and there she had been able to heal. She was pleased to see me alive, I will grant her that. But it was all her fault.

The Apprentice's Gauntlet is tomorrow. This is it.

Thirteenth day of Taurus, thirteen hundred and fifty third year of Aries.

I passed. I thought I had failed when I was asked about the relationship between the Platonic forms and the Forms of Hermetic magic, as I had always regarded the latter as more similar to Aristotelian forms. I said so, and it must have been the right answer. Now, I must wait for my formal admission at the Tribunal.

First day of Cancer, thirteen hundred and fifty third year of Aries.

I, Antoninus of Jerbiton, who was William of York, magus, follower of Jerbiton, do take up my pen for the first time as a member of the Order of Hermes to record the events of the Tribunal of Stonehenge, held in the covenant of Blackthorn, deep in the twisting caves underneath the Black Mountains.

I was admitted magus, of course. Julia put forward her scheme concerning the Great Chamber, outlining the plans, and showing images of what it would look like when built. She talked, in vague terms, of promises to sponsor an order of religious to care for the site, and I could see the presiding Quaesitor glower. The Praeco interrupted her to ask about the dangers of meeting in the Dominion, but she parried that one well. Then another member of Blackthorn, Golias of Tytalus, raised a new objection. How, he asked, did she plan to keep control of the religious, when the rest of their order would doubtless want a say. She replied that she planned to form a new order. He asked her how she planned to do that, in the light of the Pope's decree banning all new orders. That rocked her, and with only Voluntas, Semitae, and Schola Pythagoranis supporting her scheme, it was voted down. The presiding Quaesitor even went so far as to remind her that putting such a scheme into effect without Tribunal permission would be in breach of the Code. I have never seen her look so defeated. Maybe in future she will

consider more carefully before putting the lives of the covenfolk at risk.

I will leave this Tribunal now. I am planning to travel to Novgorod: I believe that some of the people there are still pagan, and I think that the Order may be able to do great things out from under the church's influence.

## Welcome!

Welcome to Ars Magica™, and to the world of Mythic Europe™. It is a place where the glories of the Classical world are dust and the promise of the Renaissance is yet to come. The time is the 13th century—1220 to be exact. Life is a struggle: wars and plagues stalk the land, the Church and kings rule with an iron fist. Yet Mythic Europe is also a place of magical wonder, inhabited by all the creatures of folktale and myth. What the folk of the land believe holds true: faeries and rural spirits must be placated; demons corrupt everything they touch; divine power is accessible through prayer; and magic is everywhere.

Against this background, you will play a magus, a member of the mystical Order of Hermes. Your character will wield the magical energy that pervades the world, and seek great arcane knowledge. You and your fellow players will also portray the loyal companions and grogs that stand with the magi in their covenants. These stalwart protectors provide a buffer between the magi and the mundane world that often misunderstands their power and motives. This is the setting for Ars Magica.

## Overview

Ars Magica is full of special terms and concepts. Most of these will be unfamiliar to you, even if you are a roleplaying veteran. Although all the information that you need to know is presented in detail in its own sections, this section provides an overview of Ars Magica's background and mechanics.

## Playing Ars Magica

Ars Magica is meant to be played by a group numbering anywhere from three to ten or more. This association of players is called a troupe. Unlike many other roleplaying games, in Ars Magica, each troupe member controls a number of distinct characters, not just one. In most Ars Magica troupes, different players take turns leading the story, that is,
