CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
55

Crossbows: The use of mechanically drawn bows. They fire short-fletched quarrels with penetration better than most other bows.

Siege Equipment: The operation and knowledge of arbalests, catapults, and other very long range or heavy load trajectory equipment.

## HERMETIC SKILLS

Hermetic Skills may only be purchased by magi of the Order of Hermes.

Certámen: Fighting magical duels. Add your score in this Skill to your rolls in certámen (see page 78). Specialties: Any single Art. (Intelligence)

Parma Magica: Protection from magic. This is a special ritual (not a ritual spell) that takes about a minute to perform. It lets you add 5 times your Parma Magica score to magic resistance rolls until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. You may also protect one other person for each point in Parma Magica, but the score is effectively modified by $-3$ (so you need a score of $4+$ to do any good at all). You may cancel the effect at will. Specialties: protection from any specific Form. (n/a)

## PERFORMANCE SKILLS

Jongleur: Covers the skills it takes to be a professional, all-purpose entertainer and minstrel of the Middle Ages. This includes juggling, showy acrobatics, and slapstick humor. Jongleurs can be found in both marketplaces and noble courts—some even frequent the homes of wizards. This sort of amusement is often very coarse; troubadours supply the more serious poetic and musical entertainment. Specialties: jester, juggling, insults. (Communication, Dexterity)

Play (Instrument): Performing with a certain instrument and familiarity with a repertoire of music appropriate to it. When you purchase this skill, choose a specific instrument. You may purchase this skill more than once in order to learn a variety of different instruments. Specialties: solo, ensemble, vast repertoire. (Dexterity, Communication)

Sing: Singing well, and knowing a repertoire of songs. Everyone can sing after a fashion, but this Skill indicates a level of competence such that others enjoy listening to your voice. Specialties: solo, ensemble, ballads, war songs. (Communication)

Storytelling: Choosing an appropriate tale from your repertoire (which grows with your score) and telling it well. Masters of the art can recite different stories for weeks without repeating themselves. Specialties: poems, epics, romances, improvisation. (Communication)

## ROGUE SKILLS

Disguise: The know-how to mimic other people or to fit into the crowd by adopting special clothes, appearance, voice and behavior. Roll Perception + Disguise to convey an image (add +3 if using a model); observers make a similar roll, comparing it to yours to see through the disguise. Each party modifies the roll by -3 for an unfamiliar person or +3 for a well-known person. Specialties: nobles, magi, clergy, peasants. (Perception)

Forgery: Forging documents and wax seals. Scribe helps but is not always a requirement—the storyguide must be the judge of when Scribe is required. Successful reproduction of a person's handwriting and style is tricky—it takes a roll of $12+$ to forge a missive from a baron to his loyal vassal, but only if you have a sample letter. Specialties: legal documents, seals. (Communication, Intelligence)

Legendemain: Sleight of hand and knowledge of confidence games requiring sleight of hand. It requires a delicate touch and great hand-eye coordination. Legendemain includes filching things from market stalls and cutting purses, as well as the "magical" trickery often used to raise money from credulous folk. The target of an attempt rolls Perception + Awareness to detect your actions. If the perceiver has Legendemain skill, he may substitute that for Awareness if he wishes. On particularly delicate moves such as picking pockets, he receives a +3 bonus. Specialties: filching, picking pockets, "magic" tricks. (Dexterity, Quickness)

Pick Locks: Opening locked things without the convenience of a key, usually without the permission of the owner. Certain locks are so intricate that a minimum skill level is required even to make the attempt, but these are very rare. Most medieval locks are much larger, bulkier, and simpler than their modern counterparts. Specialties: speed, avoiding traps, in darkness. (Dexterity)

Stealth: Sneaking about without being seen or heard, also hiding in one place. This includes following people without their noticing, which is rolled against the other person's Perception. Specialties: hide, sneak, shadowing, urban areas, natural areas. (Dexterity)

## SOCIAL SKILLS

Bargain: The know-how to get the greatest return for a service or product, while paying the least. It involves reading the person with whom you haggle, a general knowledge of the value of goods, and presenting yourself in certain ways. A good haggler can easily overcome resistance in an inexperienced customer and see through attempts to overvalue most merchandise. Specialties: specific types of products, hard sell. (Presence, Communication)
