ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

purchasing new Abilities or increasing the levels of your starting Abilities.

As a person grows more skilled or knowledgeable, it becomes harder to improve on that training; more experience points are required to raise an Ability of 3 up to a 4 than to increase a 1 to a 2. Hence, Abilities are purchased on a pyramid system. In order to raise an Ability to the next level, you must pay a number of experience points equal to the score you wish to attain. For example, to raise a score of 0 to a score of 1 costs one experience point. To raise a score of 4 to a score of 5 requires five experience points. The Ability Cost Table below is a summary of this system, recording the total number of experience points required to bring your score from 0 to a given number.

Be sure that the Abilities you choose make sense for your character's identity, especially those related to his profession, background and culture. If you are using a vocation template, suggestions are spelled out there. In general, however, grogs should choose the Abilities they need to be warriors, guards, and servants. Typically these include good Weapon Class scores, Awareness, Survival, or Chirurgy. Companions generally have high scores in Abilities related to their specialty, whatever that is. Magi should make sure to purchase Arcane Abilities such as Finesse, Concentration, and Penetration, which are often as important as spells themselves. All characters should have the linguistic proficiency necessary to communicate with other characters.

## Specializations

Similar to Characteristics, each Ability you select for your character should be assigned a specialization. While specializations for Characteristics have no mechanical effect, Ability specializations do. When you are using an Ability in a way that incorporates your specialization, you act as if your score were one level higher than it actually is. For example, if you have the skill Single Weapon 3, with the specialization longsword, you act as if your Single Weapon was 4 when using longswords.

|  Starting Experience Points  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Magi | Defined by house affiliation  |
|  Companion | 2 x age  |
|  Grog | 2 x age  |

Suggested specializations for each Ability are listed in italics at the end of each description. Other specializations are possible with the permission of your storyguide.

## Ability Descriptions

The Ability descriptions below tell what actions that Ability covers, from the character's point of view, example-specializations, and (in parentheses) the Characteristics most often used with it.

Ability descriptions are general because they categorize human endeavor, something that is not easily divided into discrete units. You may not know which of your character's Abilities applies to a situation. As a rule of thumb, if an action is covered by one Ability, a different Ability does not apply. When in doubt, ask your storyguide.

If your character needs an Ability that is not described here and the storyguide approves, invent it yourself.

## Talents

Talents are untrained but intuitive capabilities. They can only be improved through actual use, usually on adventures.

## ARCANE TALENTS

These talents can only be possessed by characters with magical abilities.
