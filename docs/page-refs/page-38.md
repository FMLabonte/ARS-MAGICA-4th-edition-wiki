ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# +0 Virtues

Wanderer: This is the default category. You are not tied to any liege or community, though you might well live at the covenant. You may have standard equipment and a riding horse.

Covenfolk: You have lived at the covenant for a long time, perhaps since birth. The quality of your armaments depends on the resources of the covenant.

Freeman/Freewoman: You most likely are a city dweller. You probably have a skill that allows you to survive, like blacksmithing, leatherworking, or other less savory work. You also have the tools necessary to perform your trade.

# +1 Virtues

Failed Apprentice: You were once apprenticed to a magus, but something kept you from completing your studies. Perhaps your Gift was incomplete, or maybe some grievous mishap robbed you of it altogether. You may still work for your former master. Magi welcome you and have compassion for you (those who are given to such emotions, anyway). You may have Arcane and Formal Knowledges as beginning Abilities, and you are familiar with the life of a magus. If your Gift was not completely destroyed, you most likely have some Exceptional Talents. You begin with whatever equipment your covenant is willing to provide you.

Mendicant: You are a member of a mendicant order, friars and sisters who go among the serfs and poor free farmers, spreading the word of the Church, conducting mass, performing marriage ceremonies, and baptizing children. You are sworn to serve the Church for the rest of your life. Although you are a servant of the Church, you lack political influence within the organization. You are poor, either by vow or by circumstance, and may have only inexpensive armaments. Due to your training, you have the +1 Virtue Educated.

Petty Merchant: You are struggling, but it is better than being a serf, by far. You own or run a business that generates significant wealth, but provides you with little (if any) political clout. You have to devote considerable time to managing and protecting your enterprise. You have a yearly income of about 400 silver pennies, and may own standard armaments and a mount.

Wise One: You belong to a broad class that includes mystics, seers, healers, and the like. You are probably magical, and will probably want to purchase a Virtue that gives you some sort of supernatural ability. You are well regarded in the community, although your presence may cause fear as well as awe or respect. If you lack such good standing, though, you are most likely a wanderer or an outcast. You may have standard armaments.

Prosperous Peasant: You are a free peasant, but you are wealthier than most of your kind. You hold a yardland (30 acres) in free tenancy, and this will yield an income of 400 silver pennies per year as long as it is worked. You may leave your farm, or even sell it, after play has started.

# +2 Virtues

Knight-Errant: You wander in search of adventure, honor, fame, and wealth. You are entitled to bear arms, and are a member of the nobility. You are accompanied by a bodyguard or squire, and begin play with the +2 Virtue Superior Armaments. You may purchase the Quality Armaments Virtue at one less point than listed, during character creation.

Lesser Noble: You are part of the nobility, though you have no title greater than "Lord" or "Lady." You probably reside near the covenant in the house of a local noble, and might be a niece, nephew, or other such distant relative. Although you do not want for anything, neither do you have vast wealth. You receive a stipend of about 40 silver pennies a month to spend as you see fit, but you will have to ask your family to buy very expensive items for you. You may have standard equipment.

Mercenary: You lead a small company of mercenaries (5 to 10 grogs), for hire to the highest bidder. You are much like a knight-errant, only without the prestige. During your travels you have gained great wealth—and squandered it—several times over. A less successful mercenary may be treated as a Wanderer (as above). You automatically have the +1 virtue Good Armaments. Your mercenaries have standard armaments.

# +3 Virtues

Magister in Artibus: You have incepted Master of Arts in one of the universities of Europe (Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge, Montpellier, Arezzo or Salamanca) and completed your two years' regency of compulsory teaching. You are entitled to be addressed as Magister, and you may teach at any university in Europe. You have the following abilities, at no cost: Speak Latin 5, Scribe Latin 3, Artes Liberales 3, Disputatio 3, and Lectio 3. You may purchase further Academic Knowledges or Skills during character generation, and may take the Further Education virtue to spend more time at university. You are at least (25 - Int) years old.

If the storyguide allows it, magi may take this virtue. Magi who take this Social Class began their magical training after incepted, so are relatively old. Such magi have an additional 21 experience points to spend on Arcane Talents, Skills, and Knowledges, as they did not need to learn Latin as part of their apprenticeship. You are at least (35 - Int) years old.

Priest: You are a member of the clergy, with a specific position of authority in the religious hierarchy. You therefore come under the protection of Canon Law, meaning that you cannot be prosecuted by secular authorities (even if you regularly fail to fulfill your vows). You are accorded some respect, or at least fear, due to your position, but nobles still usually outrank you since they have a great deal of political power in the Church. You have an income of approximately 30 silver pennies a month. You may tap parish funds for more, but you risk drawing the attention of the bishop if you do. You automatically have the +1 Virtue Educated, allowing you to purchase Formal Knowledges.

Wealthy Merchant: You are at the top of the growing merchant class, neither noble nor common. You have contacts throughout society, as well as some influence with the local ruler. You are quite wealthy and realize a profit of 2000 silver pennies a year, which you take as income. Furthermore, you have goods worth about five times that. You may have a bodyguard and standard armaments, and may also possess a large house or a ship that you live on.

# +5 Virtues

Landed Knight: You owe fealty and service to a higher noble, and control land, serfs, and men-at-arms. Your income is about 2000 silver pennies a year, after expenses, including food. You are usually accompanied on adventures by a bodyguard or squire (probably a grog, unless another player wants to develop the character as a companion). You have sworn an Oath of Fealty (as the -1 Flaw), and so may be called upon to serve your lord at inopportune moments. You begin the game with Superior Armaments (as the +2 Virtue). Typical armaments for a
