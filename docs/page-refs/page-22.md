ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Magic Deficiency with Ignem (variable): Bjornaer, the founder of the House, never learned this Art well, and her deficiency has been passed from master to apprentice for hundreds of years. Most Bjornaer magi have this weakness—apparently something about their training makes learning fire magic difficult. See page 35.

Stingy Master (-2): Your master focused on the peculiar interests of Bjornaer magic more than Hermetic training, and as a result you do not have the firm grounding in magical theory that other apprentices receive. See page 36.

## House Bonisagus

Starting Abilities: Magic Theory 5, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 3, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: Equal to age

Because of the high esteem in which the founder of this house is held among magi, followers of Bonisagus enjoy special status.

## Required Virtue:

Hermetic Prestige (+1): As a member of House Bonisagus, you are accorded respect among magi. See page 34.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Magical Affinity (variable): Your master encouraged you to excel in a specialty so that you could bring new insights to House Bonisagus. Fellow magi in the house expect you to push this specialty to its limit. See page 34.

Book-Learner (+1): See page 40.

Inventive Genius (+1): See page 34.

Knack with Magic Theory: Due to this house's scholarly interests, apprentices receive excellent training. See page 40.

Blatant Gift (-1): Your intense involvement with magic has made you noticeably different. See page 35.

Driving Goal (-1). You are determined to become the unchallenged expert in your particular magical specialty. See page 47.

Obese (-1): Life in a laboratory has left you flabby. See page 47.

Magic Deficiency (variable): In the mind of a follower of Bonisagus, a magus who excels at a specific type of magic is much more valuable than a generalist. You can spend your entire life exploring the magic that you are good at, so there

is no need for you to be able to do everything. You focused so strongly on your magical specialty during apprenticeship that your master neglected to correct difficulties you had in other areas. See page 35.

## House Criamon

Starting Abilities: Enigmatic Wisdom 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 10 + age

Criamon magi's constant pursuit of the Enigma leaves them altered and strange in the eyes of others. Most typical Virtues and Flaws for this House reflect this tendency.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Cursed (variable): Delving into your own magic has caused you some damage, which could be the equivalent of a curse. See page 46.

Knack with Enigmatic Wisdom: You have special insight, and gain the insights of others easily. See page 40.

Magical Affinity (Mentem, Imáginem, or Intéllego) (variable): More precise affinities, such as with ghosts, are also common among Criamon magi. See page 34.

Strong Personality (+1): Lack of social contact has allowed your personal traits to grow unchecked. See page 42.

Blatant Gift (-1): Your magical nature is strong and evident; the quest to understand the Enigma has left its mark upon you. See page 35.

Disfigured (-1): Arcane symbols tattooed on your face give you a bizarre appearance. See page 47.

Obsessed (-1): You may be obsessed with something related tangentially or symbolically to your quest for knowledge, or you may simply be a bit off balance. See page 48.

Stingy Master (-2): Your master concentrated on unraveling the Enigma over teaching you magic theory. See page 36.

Twilight Points (-1): The mystical pursuits of Criamon magi often plunge them into Wizards' Twilight. See page 36.
