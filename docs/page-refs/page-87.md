CHAPTER IV
LABORATORY
87

Concentration: When investing an effect, you can arrange to have the device maintain concentration on the effect for the wielder. This option adds +5 to the effect's level. Note that the wielder still needs to concentrate to change how the effect is used. For instance, a levitation belt that does not require concentration can hold someone in the air, but to move up or down the wielder must concentrate. Effects left to their own concentration start to wear off at sunset and sunrise. At these times the wielder must concentrate on the effect for a few moments to perpetuate it until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first.

Effect Use: You can restrict the use of a device's effect to a specific list of people (for example, to you and all your current apprentices) by adding +3 to the level of the effect. Otherwise, invested devices can be activated by anyone who knows their trigger actions.

Charges: It is possible to instill an effect whose power expires after a given number of uses. The following table lists Lab Total modifiers to place a given number of charges in a device. Each time the power you have instilled is activated, one charge is used up. When all the charges have been used, the item stops functioning.

Note that you must still choose a number of uses per day when you instill an item with charges. Thus such an item is restricted in how often and how much it can be used. You cannot give charges to an item of Constant Use.

A device that uses charges can be made rechargeable by adding 5 levels to the level of the effect. Actually recharging the effect takes one season and costs an amount of vis equal to that which was originally spent investing the effect. In order to recharge a device, you must either have the lab text (see below) from the device's creation, or you must successfully investigate the power which you are recharging.

|  Number of Charges | Effect Level Modifier  |
| --- | --- |
|  1 | –5  |
|  2 | –4  |
|  3 | –3  |
|  6 | –2  |
|  12 | –1  |
|  24 | 0  |
|  50 | +1  |
|  100 | +5  |

Effects that Govern the Device Alone: Some effects work only on the device in which they are placed, such as a staff that grows thorns like the spell Transformation of the Thorny Staff. If the effect only works on the device containing it, the total effect level, after all other modifications, is divided by 2.

## Instilling the Effect

Once you have designed the effect that you want to invest in your device, you have to perform the ritual of joining. Your Lab Total (based on the Form and Technique scores appropriate to the effect) is compared to the total modified level of the effect. Several other modifiers apply to your Lab Total:

- If the effect you are investing mimics a spell with casting requisites, those requisites apply to your Lab Total.
- If one of the bonuses listed on the "Form and Effect Bonuses Table" for the material or form of the device your are using matches the effect being invested, that bonus is added to your Lab Total. For example, if you were enchanting a lamp to constantly produce magical light, you would add +7 to your Lab Total.
- Add the strength of your magic aura (probably that of your covenant) to your Lab Total.
- For each effect already in the device that has a Technique and/or Form in common with the effect being invested, add +1 to your Lab Total.

You can only invest an effect if this modified Lab Total exceeds the modified level of the effect. For each point by which your total exceeds the level, you accumulate 1 point per season. When you accumulate points equal to the effect's modified level, you invest the power. (Thus, if your Lab Total is double the modified level of the effect, you can invest it in one season.)

For every 10 points, or fraction thereof, of the modified level of the effect, you must also expend one pawn of raw vis of an Art appropriate to the effect being invested. This vis is expended in the first season you begin investing the effect. But remember, a given item can only hold a limited number of effects. If the amount of raw vis required to instill an effect brings the total amount of raw vis used above the total used to prepare the item for enchantment in the first place, the effect cannot be invested. So if you are enchanting a silver dagger (which takes 12 pawns of vis to prepare for enchantment), you can only put 12 pawns worth of effects in it. If the dagger already has 10 pawns worth of effects, an effect that requires 3 pawns of vis (that is, an effect of level 21 to 30) does not fit; you cannot put it in the dagger.
