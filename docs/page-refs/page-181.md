A character begins to show the signs of aging after about 35 years. Every year of a character's age after (35 + Stamina), in the winter—a particularly harsh time in the Middle Ages—the player must make an aging roll. Normally, a quality die is used, but if the character is taking a longevity potion, roll a simple die instead. Adjust by +1 for every complete decade of the character's age (for example, if the character is 37, add 3), by +1 for every Decrepitude point the character possesses, and use the modifier from the Social Class Table that best reflects the character's social class. If the character is taking a longevity potion, adjust the roll by -1 for every five full points of Lab Total in that potion. If the total is above 6, consult the Aging table below.

## Aging and Afflictions

Age causes people to degenerate, and afflictions are its most visible effect. An affliction can be chosen by the storyguide or by the player, at the storyguide's option. An annoying affliction is simply something to be roleplayed—it is a harbinger of things to come, with no penalties to rolls. The player should make a note on the character sheet, stating what the affliction is and giving it a score of 0. If a character gains a minor affliction, something more serious develops, such as cataracts in the eyes; this has a score of 1. A major affliction represents something very serious; perhaps the character fell and broke a hip, and now walks with a bad limp. The affliction's score is 2.

Afflictions worsen through the years, and a character may develop new ones as he grows older. Let the story dictate whether new afflictions develop or old ones become worse—the storyguide is the arbiter. If the latter, the player rolls a simple die and adds the score of the affliction; on a result of less than 9, the affliction worsens by the amount stated on the Aging Table—add that number to the current score. The score of the affliction acts as a penalty to all related rolls.

An affliction that has a score of 6 or higher is crippling. For example, if a character has the affliction “Going Blind,” with a score of 4, subtract 4 from all rolls involving sight; if the affliction had a score of 6, the character would be completely unable to see.

No affliction score may be greater than 6, and a character may have no more than five different afflictions. A player can opt (or may be forced, if he already has five afflictions at level 6) to have his character gain a Decrepitude point instead of gaining or worsening an affliction. A character with 10 or more Decrepitude points dies of old age; this can be a good roleplaying opportunity.

It is highly unlikely for a character to die from aging before the age of 50 or so. Few characters grow old, though; Mythic Europe is a dangerous place. If one of your troupe's characters does die of old age, it is something of a victory, for he has managed to survive all the world's perils.

## Longevity Potions
