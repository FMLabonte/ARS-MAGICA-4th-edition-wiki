CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

die again, doubling whatever number comes up, and so on, just like a quality die roll. If you initially roll a 0 on a stress die, it counts as a 0, not a 10, and you usually must check to see if you botch. To check for a botch, roll again. This second die is called a botch die. If your botch die comes up 0 your character has botched—something has gone horribly wrong. Your character has failed, regardless of the final modified score of the die, and some special penalty, devised by the storyguide, generally applies. In particularly tricky situations, you may have to roll more than one botch die. Each extra 0 rolled increases the severity of your failure. Note that any result other than a 0 on a botch die is disregarded.

No matter which way the die is rolled, the result is added to the sum of the character's Characteristic and Ability. This total sum must meet or exceed an ease factor that is either assigned by the storyguide or written out in the rulebook. The ease factor will be higher for difficult tasks, and lower for easier tasks.

Often, modifiers other than the appropriate Characteristic and Ability will apply to a given die roll. Advantages or disadvantages are sometimes stipulated in the rules, or the storyguide may assign modifiers based on the specific situation. These modifiers should be added in to the total before comparison to the ease factor.

For example, say that the character above was trying to remember a specific weakness of dragons. In order to remember, the storyguide says that he must beat an ease factor of 9. His Intelligence is +1 and his Legend Lore is 4. He rolls a stress die (the storyguide deems that there is a chance of a botch—he could remember incorrectly and put himself in a load of jeopardy), getting a 5. His total is 10, which exceeds the ease factor. He successfully remembers the fact. Had he rolled a 0, he would have to roll a botch die to see if he had botched and remembered incorrectly. Had he rolled a 1, he would have rolled again, doubling the result and adding his Intelligence and Legend Lore.

# A Note on "You"

In this book the word "you" refers alternatively to you, the reader and player, and to you as a magus or other character in the game. Take this as an invitation to see the world through the eyes of your character. You should not take this to mean that you, the reader, can somehow research this book in order to gain supernatural powers, or that we at Atlas Games are somehow imparting you, the reader, with such supernatural knowledge.

Let context and common sense be your guide.
