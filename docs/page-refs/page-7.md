CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

I think I should write down what I have been taught, because I am sure that my mistress will not repeat it. She, and the other magi here, are members of the Order of Hermes, which seems to be much like the Cistercian Order to which I once belonged. It is divided into twelve Houses, of which Jerbiton is hers, and will, as her apprentice, one day be mine. The Order governs magi by the Code, which is enforced by the Quaesitores and at the Tribunals, which meet every seven years, one in each region of Europe. My mistress wants to build a Great Chamber, a new meeting place for our Tribunal, in London, because she says that the covenant of Blackthorn, as host, unduly influences the decisions. There are no abbots in this Order, and every magus has a say, so there is no-one to stand against Blackthorn’s corruption.

Covenants, like Blackthorn and Voluntas, are something like monasteries, I think. Several magi live together, sharing resources and governing themselves. Voluntas has a council of all the magi, and my mistress believes that we should build a fine new chamber for the council meetings, so that their importance is more obvious to the other magi. I think that she wants Corvus and Desiderius to regard them as more than simply distractions from work. They complain every time they are forced to leave their laboratories, even if it is only to fetch a book from the library.

My training will last for fifteen years, and at the end of it I will be admitted to the Order, and then I shall have the same rights as my mistress, and the power that Jocelin spoke of.

Fourth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.

My mistress is going to visit another covenant, and she has decided to take Jocelin and me along. This will be the first time I have been out of the covenant since I arrived, apart from brief visits to Wilton, and Jocelin has been helping me with preparations. Henry the Tailor has made me a proper traveling cloak, and Henry the Smith has prepared me a dagger and an ax. We leave at dawn, and Jocelin is being deliberately mysterious about our destination. He won’t tell me where the covenant Semitae is, telling me that I shall understand when we get there.

Eighth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.

We were attacked by brigands today. They were waiting in ambush, and the grogs had to fight them off at first, until my mistress could cast a spell. The spell, and the speech that she made after casting it, convinced them that we were important allies. They swore by the Holy Cross that they would not harm us, and then escorted us to the edge of their territory. Jocelin noted the route, and says that we will return another way. I don’t see why: we dealt with them easily, but Jocelin is afraid to rely on magic too much.

Twelfth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.

We have arrived at the covenant Semitae, and I see what Jocelin meant. The covenant lives in several large wagons, and travels around the Tribunal. Their route is planned by Gerfallon of Criamon, the head of the covenant, which Jocelin says makes it nearly impossible for any sane person to track them down. My mistress is closeted with Gerfallon, but I haven’t seen him (or her, I don’t know) yet. Junius of Verditius, who makes the wagons, is entertaining us. They are fashioned of iron, so that a magus may have his laboratory in one, and they change the ground that they cross to make a firm road. Junius told us about his new project, which is to make a wagon that can be pulled through the sky and over the seas. He said that the main problem is the horses, and he thinks that he may have to make them as well, mundane horses not being suitable. I suggested that he just make the wagon move itself, but he didn’t like that idea. Wagons do not move themselves naturally, while horses do, so it is easier to enchant a horse to move than to do the same for a wagon. There are so many things to remember when working magic.

Thirteenth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.

We have left Semitae, and my mistress is pleased with the results of our visit. I asked Jocelin why we had to walk, and he told me that most magi cannot ride horses, because the beasts hate their magic, and throw them off. I am unusual in that. He told me not to ask my mistress about it, because she is sensitive on the subject.

Twentieth day of Virgo, thirteen hundred and forty second year of Aries.

My mistress is in a foul mood. She went to the council today to try to convince them to build the new council chamber. I have seen the plans: it is heptagonal, with a vaulted stone roof supported by a slender central pillar. It is truly beautiful, but they made her choose between that and the Great Chamber. She chose the bigger project, and made them promise to give her the money for the land next year, but she is still raging about their lack of vision.

Ninth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.
