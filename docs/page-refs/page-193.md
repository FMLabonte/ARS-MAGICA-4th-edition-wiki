# Chapter VIII Saga

In Ars Magica saga tells the story of a covenant, portraying its passage through one or more of the seasons of its existence. This chapter is designed to help you create and maintain a saga. Organizing a saga may initially seem an enormous task—and it does involve considerable work and imagination. But given time, experience, and some effort, you should be able to create a saga filled with exciting locales, dastardly villains, and awesome magic.

## Creating a Saga

Sagas in Ars Magica are different from campaigns in other roleplaying games because in Ars Magica, different members of the playing group are encouraged to trade off in taking on the duties of storyguide. One player might be in charge of a specific area of saga development, with others taking on other roles. One might run a series of adventures based on one theme, while another might oversee seasonal development of the characters in the covenant. Of course, nothing prohibits the more traditional approach where one storyguide does all of the work by himself. Before anything else is considered, your troupe should decide who will be doing the work of saga creation, and which players will take part in its administration. See "The Troupe" on page 174 for more information.

## Saga and Drama

The word "saga" calls many images to mind. Chief among these elements is drama, for if nothing else, roleplaying is dramatic. In a saga worthy of the name, something vitally important is at stake. It could be something as grandiose as the pursuit of absolute knowledge or as focused as the preservation of a mysterious, enchanted forest. The importance of what is at stake is purely subjective, but the effect of its accomplishment, salvation, or loss must be enough to permanently mark the world in some way.

When you first consider the framework that your saga will rest upon, think in dramatic terms. What sort of narrative will your saga tell? What will make its stories interesting, heroic, and exciting? Where will it all end up? Answers to these questions of great scope will guide you as you create the details of your saga. They will help ensure that it does not bog down, or deviate into realms that are dull or irrelevant. Such questions lay the foundation of drama.

Before proceeding to do the work involved with creating your saga, you should have a good vision of the big picture.

## The Work of Creation

There are two different approaches you can take to the actual creation of your saga. The first is to lay all of the framework in advance, figuring out where the saga will go before your players create characters. This method has the advantage that you can create a story that is as tightly woven as you like. The players must then fit themselves into your creation. The second approach is to begin creation as your players begin to generate their characters and covenant. This allows them a great degree of input, but makes your job more difficult. You must incorporate all their different and often conflicting motives and ideas into a coherent whole.
