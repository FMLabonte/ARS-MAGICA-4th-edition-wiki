ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# Personality Traits

In Ars Magica your character's nature is translated into game mechanics called Personality Traits that describe his inclinations and predilections. These are recorded as brief descriptions with numerical scores, such as Brave +2. The score may be positive or negative, indicating a strong sympathy or antipathy to the stated quality. You cannot normally have a score of more than +3 or less than -3, unless a Virtue or Flaw allows otherwise.

Personality Traits serve two major functions. First of all, they provide a concrete description of how a given character is likely to act. In this capacity, they can be used to randomly determine a character's reaction to a given situation. (But note that a character is never required to determine how he acts based on the results of a roll.) Secondly, they serve as a sort of shorthand that describes a character's personality. In troupe-style roleplaying, each player may play the role of several different characters over the course of a saga. Personality Traits serve to remind the player what a given character is like each time he assumes a new role.

When assigning Personality Traits, you should think about how they arise from your character's background, upbringing, and life experience. You can take as many or as few personality traits as you would like, and assign each any value that you feel is appropriate. It's best to choose no more than five, with only one or two extreme values. Otherwise you run the risk of creating a caricature rather than a believable person.

Sometimes Personality Traits result in conflicts between your motives and those of the troupe. That's something you will have to work out—hopefully not at the expense of your character's identity, or the unity of your gaming group.

# Quirks

You may want to give your character interesting personal details that add depth and charm, such as a twisted sense of humor, a fondness for animals, or a habit of grunting yes to a question. Write a short paragraph or make a list of the strange and unique things that define your character.

# Personal History

This is where you spell out your character's family connections, the area where he grew up, and any old enemies or friends. You should also specify how your character became linked to the covenant and maintains relations with it. All

of this information and anything else that you think is important about your character should be recorded both to help you remember it and so that the storyguide can refer to it if necessary.

If you're not familiar with Mythic Europe, you can work on your character's history with members of your troupe who are more versed in the world. Alternatively, you can designate some geographical area as your responsibility and have your character originate there. In general, though, don't worry if you deviate a little from the Mythic Europe that is spelled out in this book and in Ars Magica's supplements. This is a game, not a history class—do what feels right and have fun.

# Appearance

Your character's appearance makes his nature visible to others. It can be based on ethnic origin, characteristics (particularly Presence), background, Virtues and Flaws, and Personality Traits. A detailed description can make your character more tangible and interesting.

# Confidence

Each character begins the game with three Confidence points. These are used when your character is in rough situations when sheer willpower might enable him to prevail. See page 192 for information on exactly how Confidence points are used during game play.

# Size

Every creature and person in Ars Magica has a Size rating. Generally, Size is more important for comparisons between creatures of different species than of the same species. Average Size is 0, that of a normal adult human. Unless a Virtue or Flaw directs you otherwise, your character's Size is 0.

Size determines the number of Fatigue levels and Body levels your character has (see "Health and Fatigue," below). Its score is also added to Soak (used to absorb damage) and is subtracted from Defense totals (for avoiding blows in combat). Size can also, at the storyguide's discretion, influence rolls for Abilities such as Stealth and Intimidation.
