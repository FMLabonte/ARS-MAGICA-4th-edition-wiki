power in grand manors and castles, with walled gardens and high turrets that dominate the landscape.

The peasants whom the lord protects live close enough to the castle walls that they may take refuge within if danger threatens. Civilization exists only within the shelter of the lord's household and sword. Ironically, the nobility maintains its tyranny by protecting the rights of lesser people.

# The Feudal System

Under the feudal system, society is led by a king or queen who is liege to a group of great nobles, their vassals, who are in turn liege to lesser nobles. Those lesser lords are themselves liege to villages of peasants. The system is further complicated by the fact that clergy can have vassals and lieges too.

# Warlords, Vassals and Lieges

Practically all warriors are nobles, from the duke who owns the largest lands to the poor knight who defends a baron's single keep. Nobles who own vast lands usually require help in defending them. The more land and peasants a lord has, the more warriors he or she can attract, and the better castles he or she can build. This in turn allows the lord to defeat more powerful lords in battle, and thereby gain more lands, castles and warriors. This is how great lords achieve their status.

Seizing territory from a neighboring lord, however, is a dangerous gamble. If the opponent is more powerful, the attacker might lose holdings instead. Even a victorious lord might be too weak from one battle to fight the greater war that had been the true goal, or to fend off the attacks of a third party. After a thousand bloody clashes, someone found a better way. In exchange for being granted lordship over a piece of a greater noble's land, a lesser noble agrees to fight for the greater in his wars.

The greater lord contracts for the services of the lesser in a solemn and holy ritual, passing a clod of fertile earth into the hands of the lesser. He or she is then bound forever by the gift of land. The lesser lord places his or her hands between those of the greater and swears an oath of fealty: the greater is now liege to the lesser, who is vassal to the greater. A lord who controls large areas of land, and owes fealty to no greater lord (except perhaps the Emperor or the Pope), is a king or queen.

Vassals owe their lords a certain number of days of service in war each year (usually 60). They in turn can have vassals of their own, a chain ending with the lowliest landless knight, who swears fealty just for the essentials of life and the hope of being granted a little land someday as a reward for exceptional service.

# Pages and Squires

Nobles may be born, but warriors are made. By the age of seven or eight, a young noble is already a fighter-in-training. Such children are taken from their mothers and fathers and sent into a greater noble's house. They spend the next seven years as pages, learning to ride and fight, as well as serving the lord. As servants of the castle, pages also learn the courtly graces from the ladies of the household.

Between eight and twelve years of age, a page becomes a squire and now learns from a single knight. A squire earns the office of knight only after proving a mastery of the arts of war, and in any case, no earlier than age 21. What rank the knight attains after achieving that honor depends on his inherited position in the hierarchy of nobles, or what fortune he may wrest from the world. (Many of the knights fighting in the crusade in 1220 are younger sons who hope to carve their own holdings out of the Saracen lands.)

# Inheritance

The system of inheritance can be complex, and varies from land to land: sometimes only the eldest son gets all of a lord's holdings (this system is called primogeniture), sometimes other relatives take pieces, and sometimes there's a war and everything goes to another noble. Although title usually passes to male children, a noblewoman may inherit lands if she has the luck, courage, and political acumen to survive the succession. In this case, she inherits the family's titles, rights, and powers.

Since most noblewomen are not trained in the ways of war, one who fails to inherit lands usually can't win her own by impressing a lord with swordplay. If she is not an heir, a noblewoman's title and position come from her husband; she is lord over no lands and cannot have vassals. She can settle for simply being a good wife and mother, or she can exert power behind the throne of her husband. However, she may make an outright bid for her husband's lands if he's away for an extended time, or if he dies leaving no heir or one who is too young to fight.

Female lords can be formidable, for while their brothers were learning swordplay, they were becoming skilled in the arts of diplomacy and conversation, reading and writing, and foreign languages. By the law, however, noblewomen have the right to lead armies and go on crusades.
