CHAPTER X
MYTHIC EUROPE
229

Venice, jewel of the southern seas, have 100,000 residents. Still, none can rival Constantinople, with its population of more than half a million.

## Perils of Freedom

In the city, no one is lord or serf. A peasant who lives within the walls of a city for a year and a day is free, and cannot be called out to fight in one of the lord's wars. All citizens have the right to marry, move, and inherit property as they please.

Of course, too much freedom breeds anarchy and chaos, while the wealth of merchants invites the attention of thieves. To avert that danger, town councils are formed from the wealthy and knowledgeable heads of trade and commerce. These worthies levy taxes and tolls and make the laws, which are enforced by the town guard and the courts.

Many who visit a city or town for the first time are surprised at how crowded and closed in the place is. The reason for this is obvious: defense. Just as a castle and its keep protect a noble lord, the walls of a city defend it against bandits, war, or overly ambitious nobles. Of course, the walls breed crowding, filth, theft, darkness, fire, and even pestilence. Despite the risks, many townsfolk are rich in power, pride, and material goods.

## Roads

The major cities of Mythic Europe are linked with one another and with towns, castles, and monasteries, by roads. Some roads are better than others ranging from simple tracks to grand roads built by the Romans centuries ago. Where roads meet cities there are gates which are usually closed at sundown. Such gates often provide revenue to the city, as people entering are forced to pay a toll. Of course, gates also serve to keep out attackers and undesirables.

Just outside the gates, along the roads, are the pitiful shacks and decaying hovels of the very poor. Hospitals are also found here, little more than shacks themselves, run by the clergy for weary and injured travelers. Also outside the walls there are wretched shelters for lepers and other unfortunates.

## City Streets

Once inside the gates, the picture changes completely. The roads become the city's major streets and are well maintained,

with solid cobbles, ditches for waste, and only a little mud. People travel on foot and on horseback, the very wealthy ride in litters, and wagon drivers haul goods. Side streets wind about between the buildings, from which garbage and other matter rains down intermittently. They are filled with people and their pack mules, geese, dogs, cats, and whatever vermin can survive.

To enable more people to live in a large city, many buildings have two, three, or even four stories. The upper levels often extend out, overhanging the lower ones and nearly touching across the street, to give more space inside the house. As a result, light is dim on the back ways, even on the brightest day.

## Work and Play

### Markets

Living in the city is convenient, for one can purchase supplies readily. Ready-cooked food is available at market squares, taverns, and inns. Ingredients for cooking at home are also sold at the markets. Vendors sell different kinds of produce on different days: butter, poultry, meat, milk, fish, and herbs from the countryside. Craftsmen in town produce goods, like cloth and leather, in their shops and sell them at the markets.

### Fairs

Fairs are held every month or so during the mild seasons of the year, and outshine even the busiest market days. Most fairs take place on important holidays, and usually last for eight days. At these times, the city truly comes to life. Plays and pageants are put on by the various guilds for the amusement and religious instruction of the public. Entertainers come from far away to perform mimes and puppet shows, and to play music and sing.

Merchants who have been to far-off cities come to sell their wares, and perhaps tell tales of places few ever see. Hedge wizards attend fairs to sell charms and other items, while alchemists set up their velvet pavilions and cater to the wealthy. Often magi, in the company of their retainers, come to these fairs to purchase mysterious objects, or simply to enjoy the mundane pleasures of the city.

### Building Projects

There is plenty of construction work in cities, despite the limited space. Sometimes workers are expanding the walls; at other times, they execute special or lengthy pro
