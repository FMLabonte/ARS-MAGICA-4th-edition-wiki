R: Eye/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+1)

# Muto Mentem Spells

## Level 5

### Vision of the Haunting Spirit

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Group

Spell Focus: Green Turquoise (+5)

All spirits in the open and within the target area become visible (if they can do so normally). They can then turn invisible again but are likely to be interested in whoever has cast this spell on them.

Green turquoise has associations with necromancy and other evil magics.

In Asaron of Flambeau's version of this spell, a small patch of the ghost's forehead, in the shape of a tongue of flame, remains invisible.

# Level 10

## Subtle Shift of Heart

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Figure (+3)

Subtly change an emotion into a related but different one. For instance, loathing can become hate, and greed can become jealousy. The figure used must represent the spell's target.

# Level 15

## Enchantment of Detachment

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Figure (+3)

Calms and greatly lowers the intensity of the target's current emotions.

# Level 20

## Emotion of Reversed Intentions

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+3)

The main emotion influencing a character at the time of casting is replaced by its opposite over the next minute. The new emotion is felt as strongly as the original, but lacks justification and can therefore be talked out of someone. Intelligence stress roll of 9+ to resist.

# Level 25

## Recollection of Memories Never Quite Lived

R: Eye/Sight, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Rosemary (+1)

Changes the target's memory of a detail into a similar, though different, memory. The target is no more sure of this manufactured memory than of the authentic one, so he may discover strange fabrications to be false.

# Level 30

## Mind of the Beast

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Topaz (+1)

Requisite: Animál

You turn the mind of the target into that of an animal of your choice. The victim acts and thinks like that animal as much as possible.
