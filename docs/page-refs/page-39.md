CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
39

mid-13th century knight are lance, sword, kite shield, complete mail suit, and warhorse.

## -1 Flaws

**Branded Criminal**: As punishment for some crime in your past, a mark has been burned into your cheek. This adversely affects your ability to function in society.

**Outcast**: You have the rough task of making it on your own—normal society rejects you and you are not attached to a covenant. Perhaps you have a magical nature, a supernatural background, some disfigurement, or a tremendous scandal in your past. You may have only inexpensive armaments.

## -2 Flaws

**Outlaw Leader**: You command a small group (three to six persons) of outlaws. Your followers look up to you and do what you tell them—within reason. However, you must occasionally stick up for the group or one of its members, as well as provide for them. You often have to deal with challenges to your leadership in one form or another. You are well known as an outlaw in the local area, so the Reputation that you normally get along with a Social Class is increased to 3 in this case. You are actively sought by the local lord, sheriff, or other such official.

## -4 Flaws

**Infamous Outlaw**: Everyone knows your name, and although nobody is devoted full-time to your capture, you can be sure that someone will be after you whenever you come to the attention of the authorities. You can trust no one, as the price on your head is so great it makes even other outlaws tempted to turn you in (which is why you left your old band). If you are caught, there might be a debate about whether to kill you outright or save you for public execution, but your death is assured.

## Grog Status Virtues and Flaws

Even among the common folk, there are certain distinctions that rate one person higher in the community than another. Similar to Companion Social Class, Grog Status is used not only to determine a grog's place in medieval society, but also to modify rolls when interacting with others, at the discretion of the storyguide. However, it only applies to other grogs and commoners. A magus or companion isn't going to be impressed by the fact that your grog is the best brawler in the guard barracks.

## +0 Virtues

**Petty Outlaw**: You are a member of a small (three to six person) outlaw band. You may have the support of your fellows, but must help them in return and do whatever the outlaw leader tells you—within reason. Your group has a bad Reputation at level 2 in the local area, and there may be a price on your head. You may have two pieces of standard armaments, but all the rest of your equipment must be inexpensive.

**Standard grog**: You are just another member of the covenant, doing your job day in and day out, toiling hard and playing harder. This is the default category.

## +1 Virtues

**Custos**: You are a trusted servant of the covenant, having demonstrated your skill or bravery to those you work for. The magi and Companions trust you to do your job well, and you don't let them down. You begin the game with a positive Reputation 1 of your choice, that only applies within the covenant. Furthermore, you are often the recipient of special favors like better food or living quarters than standard grogs.

**Grog Leader**: You may be a turb sergeant, the head of the kitchen staff, or some other such person. The highfolk of the covenant (the magi and companions) expect you to control the grogs, and you are the liaison between the two groups. As such, you are often "in the know" about the plans the highfolk have, and you use this information to prepare your people for their duties. Sometimes other grogs challenge your leadership, but a quick clout to the head or imposition of some other penalty usually makes them accept your authority.

## -1 Flaws

**Green**: You were trained at the covenant, but have never fought in a real battle. You cannot start with a positive score in any Personality Trait relating to bravery; increasing your confidence is important to your development and your advancement within the ranks.

**Hired Sword**: You are an experienced mercenary, but you are new at the covenant. You don't know the magi or their strange ways very well, and you might not fit in with the community of grogs just yet. You cannot have a Personality Trait that involves devotion towards the covenant.

## General Virtues

## Variable Virtues

**Faerie Blood**: Somewhere in your ancestry there is a faerie, and this relation gives you an intuitive grasp of the motivations and personalities of those magical folk. Faeries are more comfortable around you than around other humans, and given time, may even forget the
