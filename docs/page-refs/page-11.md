CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

out, and the inside is filled with magic, used with the freedom of abundance.

The doors are iron, carved with silver runes, and opened at a word from the magus who came to meet us. This was Flavius of Bonisagus, the youngest magus at the covenant. As we walked through the corridors, torches flared into burning life as we approached, and sank back into darkness as we passed on. We felt, rather than saw, the servants of the covenant pass us, spirits in the darkness. We were taken to the guest area, and warned that the rest of the covenant was off limits. The main reception room was lit by a sphere of crystal which shone like the sun and hung under a gilded dome more than thirty feet across. The walls were hung with tapestries shot through with golden thread, and the furniture was covered with silks. Gems gleamed on the golden utensils, and the aroma of fresh food rose from covered trays. Three silver figures, which I took to be statues at first, proved to be the servants, magically animated and enchanted to see to our needs. My mistress affected disdain for it all, pronouncing it gaudy and vulgar. Truly, it was, but the sheer power on display was enough to awe me. I wish that Jocelin was here to see it, but the magi of Ungulus do not like consortes to visit.

We have bedchambers of equal splendor, and equal magic. There are basins into which statues of nymphs pour never-ending streams of water, and a fire that burns without fuel. The bed is hung about with curtains that seem to cut off all noise, and a bell summoned a serving girl who was ready to see to any need I might have. I have sent her away for now, but I think I may summon her again when I have finished this.

Twentieth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and fifty first year of Aries.

Oh dear. We met with the four members of Ungulus yesterday. Only Flavius was really coherent: the other three must surely be on the verge of Final Twilight. Certainly the magic here seems to have addled them, even if it is not quite ready to take them: they seemed incapable of agreeing on anything, including how to disagree with my mistress. Finally, Flavius got them to agree to support her in return for some service. I'm sure he had something in mind, because he turned to her, but another magus, Sinead Ex Miscellanea, leapt in first, demanding that we deal with a dragon who lives to the north of the covenant. The other older magi immediately agreed with her, and Flavius found that he had no choice but to go along with them. He was not happy about it.

My mistress agreed. I think that her mind is going, with this focus on the Great Chamber. We cannot expect to take

on a dragon. Were we both Archmagi I would have my doubts: as it is, this is surely madness. I have tried to persuade her of this, but all she will say is that she needs their votes. Soon, then, we will visit the dragon.

Eighth day of Virgo, thirteen hundred and fifty second year of Aries.

We escaped the dragon, but my mistress will not have the support of Ungulus at the Tribunal. Nor will she ever have Jocelin's support again. I hope that she is satisfied.

Blind in her obsession, she was sure that we could handle the dragon. She spent a year researching these things, and preparing supplies for the assault. She hired some skilled mercenaries to train the most loyal grogs, and even Jocelin went into training. I tried to dissuade him, but he only laughed, and said that he would relish being the only minstrel in England to have seen a dragon and lived to tell of it. I am sure that he would have, as well. My mistress will answer for him at some tribunal, somewhere.

Our journey across country was uneventful as far as the cave where the wyrm was said to lair. My mistress cast her scrying magics, and declared that it was safe to enter. The grogs went ahead, of course, while Jocelin and I stayed by my mistress. She was almost in a trance, so busy was she concentrating on the route ahead. She led us along a large tunnel, and into a great cave. Daylight filtered in from cracks leading to the surface, and we saw heaps of gold coins, simply scattered about the room, and many chests, full, no doubt, of rich treasures. There was no sign of the dragon.

Of course. I do not know what my mistress had been thinking. Her pathetic magics were in no way adequate to the challenge of one of the wyrms. It must have been aware of us since we approached the cave, and now it was waiting, invisible, until we were ripe for the picking. The discipline of the grogs broke, and they ran forward. One of them reached out for the gold, and it disappeared like smoke on the wind, revealing the dragon to our view. Its scales glittered more brightly then jewels, its teeth sang like swords, and its eyes were pits into the depths of Hell. It turned on our grogs, and breathed fire, sweeping over them and destroying them in a moment. Jocelin grabbed me, and turned to run back up the tunnel. My mistress stayed behind, weaving magic in an attempt to stop the beast. There was a scream, abruptly cut off, but we could see the entrance to the cave, and I thought we had escaped. Then the fire came, rushing up the tunnel behind us. Jocelin grabbed me and threw me with a strength I had never even guessed at. I flew out of the tunnel, and rolled down the hill as flame gouted out of the hole. Jocelin did not scream, even for a moment.
