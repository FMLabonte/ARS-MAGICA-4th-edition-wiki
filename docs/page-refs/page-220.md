ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

We can speak of Italy in three broad regions, distinct from one another though bound inevitably by the tortured politics of the peninsula.

## Northern City-States

Between the Alpine borders of the Holy Roman Empire and the papal lands of Central Italy lie the regions of Lombardy and Tuscany, and the extraordinary city-states of northern Italy. Here live the richest and most successful merchants of Mythic Europe.

Genoa, with her face to the west, and Venice, looking east to the Adriatic, are the greatest; between them lie such cities as Milan, Florence, Pisa and Siena. The cities are remarkable in politics as well as wealth and trade. With the Treaty of Constance in 1183, they won recognition of their independence. Now they vie with one another, and take sides in the struggles between pope and emperor.

Heresy flourishes in northern Italy, goaded on by the voluptuousness of the Church and her antagonism with the Empire. The Church would like to stamp out the heretics, but a crusade (like the one devastating the Languedoc in southern France) would do untold damage to the region—and the independent strength of northern Italy is one of Rome's strongest walls against imperial aggression.

## Papal States

In theory the great monarchs of Europe owe fealty to Pope Honorius III as temporal liege as well as spiritual father. In practice the pope is just another player in the fractured politics of the continent.

The pope's rule is very tangible, however, in the middle lands of Italy, known as the Papal States. Saint Peter's Patrimony is the name for a strip of territory along the coast by Rome, property of the Church since the earliest days. Additional territories, crossing the Appenines (Italy's mountainous spine) and encompassing the Adriatic coast from Ravenna to Ancona, were added to the papal possessions over the centuries, bestowed by kings and emperors.

Most magi of the Order avoid the Papal States, for the obvious reasons that the Dominion is powerful here and there is little love for magi in the stronghold of the Church. But, since the magical past of Rome runs deep (it was the birthplace of the Cult of Mercury, ancestor to the Order of Hermes), there are unknown treasures to be found by those brave or foolish enough to seek them.

## Sicily and Southern Italy

Sicily and southern Italy are a crossroads of Mediterranean cultures. The blood and dreams of a dozen races populate the land, from ancient Greeks and Romans to the more recent Arab and Norman conquerors. In Palermo you will find Greek, Latin and Arabic spoken all around, as well as Norman French and Italian dialects. Saracens and Normans were both tolerant rulers, content to let their Christian, Jewish and Muslim subjects cleave to their beliefs and practices. This tolerance continues under the Emperor Frederick II, who inherited the Norman possessions and was raised in Palermo.

## Eastern Europe

## Poland and the Eastern Baltic Sea

The lands extending between the Carpathian Mountains and the Baltic Sea are not well known to scholars in the west; it is surely a wild land of monsters and pagans. Some Hermetic scholars have learned of these lands and peoples from the chronicle recently written by Wincenty Kadlubek—"Master Vincent," a sometime student at the Sorbonne in Paris, currently the bishop of Kraków. Otherwise, western European books about the region are typically several centuries out of date.

Athanasius the Bald of Jerbiton, a magus who spends most of his time traveling or writing about his travels, identifies two distinct peoples in this region, according to their languages: the Slavs (related to the Slavs of southeastern Europe and Russia) and the Balts.

The great Slavic kingdom here is Poland. Their king of centuries ago, Krak, defeated the Dragon of the Vistula and so established their claim on this land. Today the greatest Polish prince is Leszek Bialy (Leszek the White, of Sanomierz). However, Poland in 1220 is in a period of fragmentation and strife, with many feuding nobles, each with his own *gród* (fortress) and retinue of warriors. A warrior caste is emerging; each *rycerz*, or knight, is a lesser noble with adequate land and income to arm himself and be able to fight in the service of his liege.

Poland is sparsely populated at this time, a situation only made worse by wars among the princes. Some lords, such as Henryk the Bearded, prince of Silesia, have appealed
