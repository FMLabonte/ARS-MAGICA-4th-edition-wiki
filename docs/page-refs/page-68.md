ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# The Limit of Energy

Hermetic magic cannot restore one's physical energy so that one can cast more spells, nor can it restore Confidence (see page 192).

# The Limit of Arcane Connections

Hermetic magic cannot affect an unseen target without an Arcane Connection.

Always keep in mind that the “laws” of post-Aristotelian, pre-Copernican physics are not rules, they are facts. Magic cannot contradict them. You can lift an object in the air, defying gravity, but you cannot eliminate gravity itself; you can see into the past, but you cannot change it.

The boundaries of Hermetic magic are well known to the Order, but that doesn’t stop magi from challenging them. Indeed, many magi spend countless years searching in vain for a way to transcend these limits. Certainly, any magus who actually succeeds in doing so will become famous, perhaps as famous as the Order’s very founders.

# Casting Spells

Most magi find themselves casting many spells. Spells are the actual magical manifestations that magi create when they use the Arts they know. You know all the spells you choose when creating a magus, and come to know more by learning or inventing them during the course of the saga.

Spells are rated by levels, according to their power. Spells of greater power have a greater level. Magi refer to spell levels by using the word magnitude (magi do not use the term level), and one order of magnitude encompasses five levels of spells. Spells of the first magnitude, therefore, are those spells of levels 1-5.

# Types of Magic

Hermetic spells are divided into two types: spontaneous and formulaic. Both draw upon mastery of the magical Arts and use magical words and gestures to obtain a supernatural effect.

With spontaneous spells, you combine words and gestures you think will produce a desired magical effect on the spot, taking into account the diverse circumstances affecting the spell, such as time of day, astrological correspondences, and the specific shape and size of the target. Spontaneous magic is therefore flexible but unpredictable. Spontaneous magic is also quite limited in duration and scope.

When using formulaic magic, you repeat magical formulae that almost always have a given effect and that are applicable under more general circumstances. Formulaic magic is more powerful than spontaneous magic, but much less flexible as you may not change a formula in any way when casting it (though some formulas allow for the extension of range and duration). Unlike spontaneous magic, formulaic magic can produce long-lasting, and even permanent effects.

Formulaic magic encompasses ritual magic, which involves very complex ceremonies and the use of raw vis to produce effects more long-lasting or powerful, or of greater range or scope, than are possible with spontaneous or basic formulaic magic. Ritual magic is more powerful than normal formulaic magic, but just as inflexible, and more expensive in terms of time, effort, and magical resources.

# Casting Spontaneous Spells

You can create original spontaneous spells to fit a nearly unlimited range of situations, because you decide what effect to attempt and then invent a spell on the spur of the moment to achieve that effect. To determine the results of a spontaneous spell, you and the storyguide first determine the Technique and Form that are appropriate for the feat being attempted. Then, you decide if you wish to expend a Fatigue level in order to increase the power of the spell. If you choose to Fatigue yourself you are pushing your limits—you must roll a stress die whether you are in a stressful situation or not. If you do not Fatigue yourself, you roll either a stress or simple die depending upon whether there could be an immediate harmful result if you do not cast the spell.

Once you have made those determinations, roll the appropriate die, add the appropriate Technique and Form, your Intelligence, and Encumbrance. Divide this total by two if you elected to expend a Fatigue level, and divide it by five if you did not. The final result is the level of the spell that you have cast.

Refer to the guidelines for the Technique/Form combination you used (in the Spells chapter) to determine whether your spell is of high enough level to have the effect you desire. If it is too low, a lesser effect may still occur, if relevant, based on the level you did manage to attain. If your result was zero or lower, there is no spell and therefore no effect. Unless you specify otherwise, the effect that you pro
