CHAPTER V
SPELLS
103

# Level

Most spells are assigned a level, which is usually a multiple of five. A 5th level spell is very weak, a 15th level spell is of moderate power, and a 30th level spell is quite powerful.

Some spells are General spells (abbreviated to Gen), which means that they may be learned at any level of difficulty—the higher the level, the more powerful the spell. You may even learn General spells at levels that are not multiples of 5.

The level at which you know a General level formulaic or ritual spell depends on where you obtained it. If you learned a General level spell that was designed for effectiveness at level 15, then that is the level at which you know it. You cannot produce effects that exceed level 15 effects with that spell unless you invent a version with a higher level or learn such a version from another source. General level spells are open-ended only in the sense that they may be learned at any level. They may not be used at a level higher (or lower) than that which is known.

# Ranges, Durations, Targets

The range, duration, and target of a spell determine what it can affect. The range governs how far the target can be from the magus, the duration determines how long the target will be affected, and the target describes what the spell can affect. Each parameter has a number of possible ratings, which can be arranged in order from least difficult to produce to most difficult to produce. This is done in the chart below. Parameters which are listed together below but are separated by a slash (like Touch/Eye) represent different actual ranges that share the same level of difficulty. They are not interchangeable, simply equivalent.

In the spell descriptions, two ranges, durations, or targets separated by a slash are commonly listed for spells. The first range or durations is the one that is normally used, while the second (or "boosted") one is the range or duration that is used if vis is expended when the spell is cast. See "Using Raw Vis" on page 77.

Each category of range, duration, and target is described below.

# Ranges

**Personal**: The effect of the spell is centered on the casting magus. The amount affected depends on the effect of the spell.

**Touch/Eye**: Touch: The magus or anything he touches, whether a person or thing. Eye: The magus may target any person or creature that he has established eye contact with. (Touch and Eye are the same "level" of range.)

**Reach**: Anything that the magus could touch (but is not necessarily touching) without moving substantially. Anything within roughly two paces.

**Near**: Anything within fifteen paces of the magus.

**Far**: Anything within a hundred paces of the magus.

**Sight**: Anything that the magus can see. If the magus is standing on the highest point for miles, this range can be immense.

**Arcane Connection**: Anything that the magus has an arcane connection to. Distance is immaterial unless the storyguide chooses to impose some limit. Such limits are usually provided in the example spells. Note that while Arcane Connection is a range, it is different from a physical item that is an arcane connection. This distinction is important, because some spells require that the caster have an arcane connection, but the spell must be cast as some range other than Arcane Connection.
