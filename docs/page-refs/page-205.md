CHAPTER IX

COVENANTS

205

|  Distance (one way) | Average Percentage at that Distance  |
| --- | --- |
|  Within the covenant | 20%  |
|  Within half a day's journey | 40%  |
|  Within a day's journey | 40%  |
|  Within two days' journey | 0%  |
|  Within a week's journey | 0%  |

need to come up with an interesting explanation.

There are two aspects to Access: how good your supplies are, and how easily you can get at them. An average covenant has access to supplies similar to those available to the average peasant, and draws them from a radius of one day's journey (about 20 miles). This trait is not concerned with the quantity of supplies. That is paid for as a part of Inhabitants, below.

The quality of supplies is bought by spending points, either positive or negative. The table on the previous page summarizes what a given number of points will purchase.

At the higher levels, the quality does not imply that all the covenfolk live like lords. It does mean that they have a wide variety of food and other goods. For example, there may be glass and silverware around, and they will eat meat as well as vegetables. Supplies will not fail above +1, even in years of drought and famine, unless they are deliberately interrupted.

The distances involved in procuring supplies are rated on a five step scale. An average covenant draws 20% of its supplies from within the covenant, 40% from within seven miles, and 40% from within a day's journey. Spending one

positive point will move 20% of the supplies one step closer, while a negative point will move them one step further away. The closest 20% is assumed to include the covenant's water supply, the furthest such exotica as lab equipment.

Note that the actual location of the covenant need have little bearing on the distances. A covenant on a mountaintop could, with a regio, have excellent supplies available within the walls, while a covenant in a city might have to buy supplies in from a great distance (though that would require a good explanation). Normally a mountaintop location will push some supplies out to two days' distance, especially if you want quality. Locating in a city brings everything within half a day's travel, and thus cost 2 positive points.

Example: Voluntas's supplies are of average quality, which costs no points. However, it is in the middle of the North York Moors. David decides that the well is within the covenant, and so the normal 20% comes from inside. In addition, the village of Wilton can supply a substantial amount, and that is within seven miles, a half day's travel. The rest of the supplies, however, are much further away: at least a week's journey. David moves the 40% of his supplies usually found within day's journey away by two steps, generating a total of 4 negative points.

## Seclusion

An average covenant has to deal with a curious traveler once a week. Each positive point doubles the time interval, each negative one halves it. This can be consistent with any level of access. An obvious castle on a mountain might
