## Step 4: Abilities

## Concept

Your character concept should have a broad base, then become more closely defined as you progress through character creation. First decide whether your character is a grog, companion or magus. Then think about his basic identity. Is your grog a stablehand, a cook, or a guard? Is your companion a warrior, or a bookworm? What kind of spells do you see your magus wielding?

Next, you need to decide your character's gender, age, and origin. All three may be chosen freely. Keep in mind that while you can choose any age, the older your character is, the more likely he is to suffer the adverse effects of advancing age. A character who is over 35 at the start of the game may have to make aging rolls before the saga begins. See "Aging" on page 180. Once age is determined, figure your character's year of birth based on the year the saga begins. That way, even if your character is out of the action for several years of game time, you can figure out his age upon resuming play.

Sometime during the creation process you will need to choose a name for your character. It can be anything you like. You will probably want to choose a name that reflects the character's ethnic background, but nicknames and pseudonyms are just as possible.

## Magi

Before creating a magus character, you should have an understanding of the magic rules. Without at least a basic grasp of the way that magic works, you may make choices that will weaken your initiate magus and curtail her potential for future development.

The most basic decision you must make about your magus is which house he belongs to. A magus' house describes the magical lineage he descends from. Brief descriptions of each of the twelve houses of the Order of Hermes follow. You can refer to the Ars Magica supplement Houses of Hermes for more exhaustive information. Remember that the descriptions here are generalizations—individuals vary dramatically.

## Houses of Hermes

## House Bjornaer

Magi of Bjornaer (BYORE-nayr) concern themselves primarily with beasts and the animalistic side of human nature. Because of this emphasis in their training, each Bjornaer magus can take the form of an animal, known as his "heart-beast." Understanding the heart-beast in particular and animals in general is considered more important than Hermetic magic by many in this house.

Due to their nature, Bjornaer magi are unable to forge the necessary links to have a familiar, and the very concept is alien to them. Some Bjornaer deride magi who take famil-
