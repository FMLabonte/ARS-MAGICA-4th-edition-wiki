ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Oversensitive (–1): You are easily offended by those who do not show proper respect to you—but your conception of “proper respect” is probably different from that of others. Traveling incognito is extremely trying, since you are treated as a mere mundane. See page 48.

## House Tytalus

Starting Abilities: Intrigue 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 10 + Age

The preoccupation of Tytalus magi with conflict manifests itself in common physical and psychological quirks.

### Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Driving Goal (–1): The constant quest for challenges drives you to prove yourself against all worthy opponents. See page 47.

Tormenting Master (–1): Your master does not believe that you have successfully passed the apprentice’s gauntlet yet, and may continue to challenge you. See page 36.

## House Verditius

Starting Abilities: Magic Theory 5, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4, Verditius Magic 1 (see below)

Starting Experience Points: 7 + Age

Verditius magi, with their dependence on physical devices to cast formulaic spells, are limited in many ways. They have compensated, though, by becoming masters of artifact creation, and their services are in high demand among both magi and important non-Gifted persons. Verditius magi have no problems dealing with Arcane Skills, spontaneous spells, Parma Magica or certámen.

### Required Flaw:

Follower of Verditius (–1): Your magic requires the use of small devices called casting tools. These must simply be held and focused on as the spell is cast in order for it to work. Verditius magi still must use gestures and words as other magi do. Each spell known requires a separate tool. The creation of casting tools is included in the time is takes Verditius magi to learn spells.

You also have a unique Arcane Skill, called Verditius Magic, reflecting your special aptitude at crafting magic items, which you may improve with experience points. Add this Ability score to your Lab total when creating magical devices, including longevity potions.

### Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Inventive Genius (+1) See page 34.

Clumsy Magic (–2): Despite centuries of practice, casting spells is still a bit tricky for many Verditius magi. See page 36.

## Companions

One of the most important factors to consider when conceptualizing your companion is why he has come to work for the magi and their covenant. Some may do so to gain knowledge, while others have more tangible goals like the acquisition of wealth and power. Many have backgrounds or talents that make them exceptional, but also make them outcasts from mundane society.

The following are descriptions of several vocations that you can use in guiding the creation of your companion. These vocations are much more informal than the magi templates found in the previous section. Each has a set of suggested Abilities that you will want to consider purchasing when you come to the Abilities step of character creation. Feel free to add, change, or delete any Abilities—they are intended simply to help you identify the main skills one would need to be considered a competent professional in a field, and to spark your imagination in creating new character concepts. Likewise, there are no required Virtues or Flaws that are associated with these vocations. Regardless of vocation, all companions (even those not based on a vocation) automatically start with Speak Own Language 5. You aren’t required to choose a vocation, and may create your companion from scratch if you prefer. You will find out how many points you get to purchase scores in your Abilities in that section.

Whether you use a vocation or not, when you select Virtues and Flaws for your Companion, you must account for your companion’s social class by choosing one of the Virtues or Flaws listed under Companion Social Class in the Virtues and Flaws section. Simply having all the skills listed under “knight” does not automatically confer that title, you must also purchase the appropriate Virtue.

## Bandit

You are crafty and slippery by nature. You probably acquire most of your money in town, but hire your services out to the magi when they need a job done. If there’s fre
