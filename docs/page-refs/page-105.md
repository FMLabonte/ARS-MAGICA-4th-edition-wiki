CHAPTER V

SPELLS

For example, consider a level 15 spell with range Reach, duration Sun, and target Group. A variant with the same effect but with range Near, duration Ring, and target Room would be level 25 (+5 to increase range Reach to Near, +5 to increase duration Sun to Ring, and no change for changing the target Group to Room, because they are at the same level). A different variant with range Personal, duration Concentration, and target Individual would be level 3 (-10 to decrease range Reach to Personal, -5 to decrease duration Sun to Conc, and -5 to decrease target Group to Individual). Note that since -10 takes the level from 15 to 5, the additional -10 only lowers the level by -1 per -5.

The storyguide may always intervene and declare that a certain combination of range, duration, target, and effect warrants a higher or lower level than that described by the guidelines and the system above.

The categories described here were built into the structure of Hermetic magic by Bonisagus. All spontaneous spells must conform to these requirements (the magus is making the spell up on the fly—he cannot also push the limits of magic theory). Formulaic spells, on the other hand, can be invented with ranges, durations or targets that are not listed here. This is usually slightly more difficult than if the closest category were used, but is largely left to storyguide interpretation.

# Ritual

Spells requiring rituals are those that fall outside the categories for listed for formulaic and spontaneous spells described under "Casting Ritual Spells" on page 69. Certain powerful spells and spells inherited from the Cult of Mercury are also Ritual spells. Storyguides should use their discretion in declaring other spells Ritual.

# Requisites

Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have greater knowledge. See "Requisites" on page 71 for a full description of how they limit the casters of particular spells. Requisites that always apply are listed along with a spell's statistics. Casting requisites are listed within the body of the spell description.

# Aimed

Spells that affect targets indirectly (that is, spells that use a medium, like fire, to strike the target) require Targeting rolls. Such spells are labeled "Aimed," and list a modifier to Targeting rolls when appropriate. See "Targeting" on page 71.

# Spell Focus

Most formulaic spells list some spell focus that aids in the casting of the spell. When such a focus is used, a variable bonus, which is listed, is gained on the spellcasting roll. These spell foci are based upon both the Law of Sympathy and the lore of Mythic Europe. See "Spell Foci" on page 77 for more details.

# Description

Describes the effects of the spell. Descriptions cover about 95% of the circumstances in which spells are used, but since magic is variable, unpredictable, and can be used in a number of ways, the responsibility for determining the effects in unusual situations lies with the storyguide.
