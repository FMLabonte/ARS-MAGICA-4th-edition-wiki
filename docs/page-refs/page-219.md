CHAPTER X
MYTHIC EUROPE

against the army of Simon de Montfort; now a mere boy sits on the Aragonese throne, and is scarcely able to press his feudal interests over the war-torn region.

# Flanders

To the northeast of France lies the county of Flanders, on the coast of the North Sea. Though small and visited by most terrible winters, it is the richest land in Christendom, for here is made the fine wool cloth that adorns lords and ladies from Granada to Constantinople. It is said the master craftsmen of Flanders can make anything, from the miniature lands of Cordoba's gardens to musical instruments that play by themselves.

The Count of Flanders is a vassal of the French king.

# Northern and Central Europe

## Denmark

This is the land of Vikings. The Danes have a long and proud history as warriors, and left their mark throughout France and England (many of the Normans originally came from Danish stock); even in the days of Charlemagne, before they had converted to Christianity, their ferocity was dreaded by the civilized nations. The land is generally cold and chilly, with frequent rains in every season except summer, and heavy snows in the winter. King Waldemar II of Denmark has recently taken advantage of the chaos within the Holy Roman Empire (during the succession of Frederick II, who was challenged by German princes), expanding his borders to the south and east along the Baltic coast.

## Malmö

A new city, founded in 1203 by Hanseatic League shippers, Malmö is a small but growing town with a moderately good harbor. Many of the inhabitants are Germans who were contracted to build the town and harbor facilities the Hanseatic merchants need to trade with the Swedes to the north. The wooden church in Malmö burned to the ground during its dedication ceremony in 1207. It has been rebuilt of stone but continually develops cracks in the walls, making it unsafe for services.

## Scandinavia

North of Denmark, across the straits, lie the lands of Scandinavia, some populated by Christians, some by pagans, and some by God alone knows what. The magi of this land follow an unknown tradition. There are tales that in the farthest of the Scandinavian lands are beings of human appearance but inhuman nature—folk who ride the wind and do not know the hearts or shapes of animals. It is also said that the wild lands harbor a great number of dragons, especially of a sort without legs or wings, like poisonous black worms.

## The Holy Roman Empire

Sprawling across central Europe is an empire that claims the legacy of Imperial Rome as its own. Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor, rules over a cacaphony of languages, lands, and peoples. This is truly an empire, not a nation. Though Frederick was crowned by the pope, the supreme pontiff is probably his greatest political rival now. In 1220, Frederick has just returned from Germany to Italy; as ruler of Sicily and the southern portion of the Italian peninsula, he has the Papal States encircled, and there is much consternation in Rome on this account.

Sicilian-bred Frederick has made his court the most cosmopolitan in Europe. He has welcomed Islamic scholars, Hermetic magi, astrologers, and travelers from strange and distant lands. He is known to keep exotic and magical animals. Churchmen regard Frederick with wariness, if not hostility; some say he is the Antichrist, and repeat rumors of strange experiments he and his servants perform on humans. The Order of Hermes, meanwhile, regards him as the most friendly of Europe's monarchs.

## Italy

Neither politics nor language unites the Italian peninsula in the 13th century. In mountainous regions feudal lords still rule their private domains; independent merchant city-republics battle one another over land and trade; and the Holy Roman Emperor plots to subject the whole land to his personal rule. The Italian language is only coming to be, as each community speaks its own dialect.
