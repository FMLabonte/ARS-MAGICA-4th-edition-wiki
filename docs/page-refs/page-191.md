# Learning Magic Theory from Vis

To increase your Magic Theory score, you can experiment with raw vis, whose properties give you insight into the nature of magic in general. When you study from vis, you must use either one, two, or three pawns. If you use one pawn, it may be of any variety. If you study from two pawns, one must correspond to a Technique, the other to a Form. You gain experience by observing the interactions of the two. If you study from three pawns, one must correspond to a Technique, the second must correspond to a Form, and the third can be of any type that is different from the first two.

Whenever you spend a season studying from vis, roll a stress die, multiply by the number of pawns used, and add the level of your magic Aura (usually the level of your covenant). If the result is at least triple your score in Magic Theory, you gain three experience points in Magic Theory. If it is at least double but not more than triple your score, you gain two experience points in Magic Theory. If it exceeds your score but does not exceed double your score, you gain one experience point. If your roll does not exceed your score you learn nothing from your experiments, and waste that season. Vis is always consumed by experimentation.

# Experience in Magic Theory

Magi can gain experience in Magic Theory by designing things in accordance with Bonisagus's theories. For every season that a magus spends inventing a spell, investing an enchanted item, or making potions he also gains one experience point in Magic Theory, unless he was working from one of his own lab texts.

# Reputations

Reputations are concrete measurements of what a character is known for. Each Reputation is defined by a descriptor, like Insane or Brave, and a number, which can range from 1 to 10. The practical maximum for a reputation is about 5. Each Reputation should also specify the group of people that it affects. A given Reputation is usually noted like this: "Thief 3, among residents of Paris."

The number associated with the Reputation can be used as a modifier to die rolls when a character with a Reputation interacts with people who are affected by the Reputation. Whether the modifier is positive or negative depends both on what the reputation is for and who exactly is being affected. For example, the character with the reputation above would receive a -3 on rolls to convince the city guard that he was loitering "with no particular intent." It would apply as a bonus to convince underworld figures to cut the character in on a deal. Of course, not everyone you deal with will care about your Reputation. When negotiating a deal with a carpenter, it will make little difference that you have a Reputation as an adulterer.

Sometimes people are not aware of a Reputation that applies to them. For example, not every resident of Paris knows that the character from the example is a thief. When there is ambiguity about whether the character is known, make a simple roll and add the level of the Reputation. If the result is 6 or greater, the Reputation applies. Furthermore, in order for a Reputation to be taken into account, the people whom the character is interacting with must recognize the character for who he is.

Reputations are increased and decreased at the decision of the storyguide. For a Reputation to increase the character must perform some action that confirms and expands the depth of the Reputation, and news of that action must
