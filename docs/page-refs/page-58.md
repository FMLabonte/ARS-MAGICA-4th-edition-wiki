ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Medicine: Medicine is the formal study of the body and its diseases. Medical practice is based on the theory of the four humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Diseases are believed to be caused by imbalances among them, hence such practices as bloodletting, to restore the balance. The auctores are Galen and Hippocrates, in many works. Medicine may be used in the place of Chirurgy, by an individual so trained. Specialties: anatomy, apothecary, physician. (Intelligence)

Philosophiae: There are three philosophies—natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. Aristotle is the auctor for all of them, in different books. Most scholars study the philosophies after the Arts but before going on to Law, Theology or Medicine. Natural philosophy is the study of the sub-lunar world. It roughly corresponds to today's science. The main texts are the Physica, De Meteorologia, and De historia animalium. Moral philosophy is the study of the proper way of human life. It covers ethics, politics, and economics—the texts are the Ethica, Politica, and Economica. Metaphysics is the philosophy of the fundamental nature of the world. The main text is Aristotle's Metaphysica. Specialties: natural philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics. (Intelligence)

Speak Latin: This skill is similar to all other Speak (Language) skills, but it is only available to educated characters. Characters who have associated with magi for long periods of time may have picked up Speak Latin with the storyguide's permission. All educated characters know Latin, since without it you cannot learn any Academic Knowledges. In other areas of the world, Greek and Hebrew fill similar functions. Characters with foreign backgrounds may choose either of these instead of Latin. Specialties: academic usage, Church ceremonies, Hermetic usage. (Intelligence)

Theology: Theology is the study of God and his work in the world. The auctores are the Bible and Peter the Lombard's Sententiae, the Bible having theoretical primacy, being infallible, and the Sentences being most studied. The speculations of theology are very abstruse, and many theologians are accused of heresy. Sometimes those accused recant, and sometimes they convince the Church that they were right after all. Theology can also be purchased (as a separate skill) for other religions like Islam and Judaism. Specialties: biblical knowledge, heresy, history. (Intelligence)

## ARCANE KNOWLEDGES

Arcane Knowledges are only available to magi or characters with formal training gained by possession of a Virtue. Arcane Knowledges may also be purchased by characters who seek out training in the course of a saga.

Enigmatic Wisdom: A far-reaching perception of strange and baffling phenomena that helps you understand their nature, though you may seem strange or even ludicrous to the uninitiated. This Knowledge is rarely taken by magi of houses other than Criamon, though there is no restriction against it. Your score in this Knowledge is added to rolls to interpret dreams and riddles, and to understand phantasms and arcane or mysterious situations. Thanks to this Ability, Criamon magi go into Wizard's Twilight (see page 182) more often, but survive it better than most. Specialties: interpreting signs, explaining the Enigma, Twilight. (Perception, Intelligence)

Faerie Lore: Familiarity with faerie powers, weaknesses, motivations, and areas. Specialties: faerie forests, faerie mounds, specific types of faeries. (Intelligence)

Hermetic Law: Judging events according to the Code of Hermes and the Peripheral Code. In addition to memorizing important precedents, this knowledge includes the practical side of enforcing Hermetic law—for example, knowing when to push for a vote or how to present an argument. Specialties: Wizards' Marches, apprentices, mundane relations, tribunal procedures, political intrigue. (Intelligence, Presence, Communication)

Occult Lore: An understanding and familiarity with the sinister side of the world. Includes knowledge of demons and their habits and weaknesses, undead and their habits and weaknesses, and the power of curses. Specialties: demons, undead, curses. (Intelligence)

Magic Theory: Knowledge of what magic is and how it works, used primarily in the laboratory. Magic Theory deals primarily with Hermetic magic, though higher scores might indicate some knowledge of other traditions. You can sometimes gain experience through experimentation (see page 191). Specialties: inventing spells, enchanting items, potions. (Intelligence)

## CASUAL KNOWLEDGES

These can be studied, but one can also pick them up through direct experience. They do not require a specific virtue to choose them initially.

(Area) Lore: Knowledge of one particular region, covenant, or even a village. It includes knowing where things are in the immediate area, local history and legends, and the centers of power in the region. Specialties: geography, history, politics, personalities. (Intelligence)

(Organization) Lore: Knowledge of the structure, operation, and goals of the specified organization. Organizations can be as large as the Church, or as small as a local craft guild. The smaller the organization, the more detailed your
