# Perdo Mentem Spells

## General

### Lay to Rest the Haunting Spirit

R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

Destroys a single, non-corporeal spirit if your roll of a stress die + spell level equals at least double the ghost's current Spirit Might. Philosophers concur that the spirit goes to the afterlife, or is perhaps weakened to helplessness, but is not actually destroyed. Souls, after all, are immortal.

## Level 5

### Tip of the Tongue

R: Reach/Sight, D: Diam/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Figure (+5)

Causes the target to forget one word of your choosing for the duration of the spell. The harder the target tries to remember the word, the harder it is to remember. The target can come up with the word without assistance by making an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 9+. If the target fails he may try again, but each additional roll adds +1 to the difficulty. The figure used in the spell must represent the person you are trying to affect.

## Level 10

### Loss of But a Moment's Memory

R: Eye/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Rosemary (+1)

Requisite: Intéllego

Removes up to five continuous minutes from a target's memory, leaving a blank. You target the loss of memory to a specific event or

time. With an Intelligence stress roll of 9+, the target realizes that memories of a certain period are missing. This ease factor can change, depending on how important the missing memory is and what sort of circumstances surrounded the event. Careful introspection over a period of time restores the memory.

### Trust of Childlike Faith

R: Eye/Sight, D: Diam/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Lock of Child's Hair (+3)

The target loses judgment and believes almost any passable lie for the duration of the spell. An Intelligence stress roll of 6+ is allowed to resist. Truly incredible lies allow easier resistance rolls.

## Level 15

### Calm the Motion of the Heart

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Figure (+3)

Removes one emotion from the target until it appears again naturally. An angry person stops being angry, and a curious one stops being inquisitive. Many a magus finds this spell useful for keeping his apprentice's nose out of his immediate business.

## Level 25

### Blessing of Childlike Bliss

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Lock of a Child's Hair (+1)

Reduces an adult mind to a child's level. The target solves problems, reasons, and expresses emotions as would a three-year-old. Magi affected cannot cast spells. At first, anyway, the target is likely to be happy at having lost a world of cares and troubles that are no longer imaginable.

### Passion's Lost Feeling

R: Eye/Sight, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Figure (+3)

The target is unable to feel any sort of emotion and acts listlessly, without motivation or cares, until taking an hour's rest or meditation. An Intelligence + Stamina stress roll of 12+ is required to resist, and dire need allows additional Resistance rolls.

## Level 35

### Black Whisper

R: Touch, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

You whisper a magic sentence in the target's ear. It takes several seconds to speak the sentence, so an unwilling, able-bodied target can stop you. If you speak the whole sentence, the target must make a Stamina stress roll of 15+ or go completely insane. You need not use your hands for this spell, but you must be able to speak.
