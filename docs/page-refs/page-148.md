# Level 70

## Poisoning the Will

R: Sight, D: Moon/Perm, T: Bound, Ritual

You curse a place, be it a valley, town, city, or covenant. The curse gradually saps the will and vitality from the people there. They become less energetic, and slowly stop caring about the place, what happens there, other people, and finally themselves. Colors seem more drab and the days longer, and there is an all-pervading sense of boredom and lassitude. Strong-willed individuals and those with strong Personality Traits are less affected, but still suffer to an extent. All Personality Trait rolls while in the area suffer a –3 modifier. This spell affects only those who are within the cursed area, including visitors to it. Those who leave the area are overwhelmed by the return of their vigor and sense of purpose.

# Rego Mentem Guidelines

The Rego Animál spells that deal with the mind may also be used as good guidelines for levels of Rego Mentem spells.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 10: Control a target's mental state (for example, awake, asleep, or confused)

Level 15: Control a natural emotion (for example, calm, fear). The target must feel the emotion before you can control it.

Level 20: Control an unnatural emotion (for example, cultivate a person's feelings of bravery where he is usually cowardly).

Level 25: Control a human being as long as you can see him.

Level 30: Give a person one complex command, which he tries to carry out to the best of his ability.

Level 40: Completely control a person's mind and emotions.

# Rego Mentem Spells

## General

### Coerce the Spirits of the Night

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

Makes a ghost obey you as long as you can coerce it with threats, such as a threat to defile its grave or to banish it to Hell. The more lurid and dramatic the threat, the more cooperative the ghost is. To affect a ghost, you must beat its current Spirit Might on a stress die + the level of the spell + Communication + Leadership. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty that depends on the potency of the threat.

### Ring of Warding Against Spirits

R: Per, D: Ring/Perm, T: Circle

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

When the spell is cast, the storyguide rolls a simple die + the spell's level. Only ghosts with current Spirit Might higher than this total can enter the ring you create. At certain angles, the ring may be seen as an orange-hued dome.

# Level 10

## The Call to Slumber

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A pinch of sand (+1)

The target becomes sleepy and falls asleep within five minutes unless some current need makes wakefulness imperative. The target can resist with a stamina stress roll of 12+.

## Snap of Awakening

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Twig (+1)

When you snap your fingers or break the spell focus, you instantly awaken the target from sleep to alert consciousness. Does not work on someone unconscious from Fatigue-level loss, wounds, or magic.

# Level 15

## Confusion of the Numbed Will

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Speck of Alcohol (+1)

Confuses a person, who must make an Intelligence stress roll to take any direct action. A roll of 12+ ends the spell, while a roll of 9+ lets the character take the intended action, but the spell remains in effect. Any lower roll means the character is confused and takes some other type of action. When it is imperative for the victim to take an action, the storyguide should allow an appropriate modifier to the roll. While under this spell, a character always strikes last in combat and gets at least a –1 on all attacking and defending rolls.

## Scent of Peaceful Slumber

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Lilac (+1)

Requisite: Auram

A very light purple haze that smells of lilacs slowly rises from the ground and remains for a few minutes. Those who breathe the haze and fail a Stamina stress roll of 9+ fall asleep. The haze first appears at about knee level. You must concentrate for two rounds in order for it to reach the height of a standing person's nose.

# Level 20

## Aura of Rightful Authority

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Moon, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Violet Amethyst (+3)

Those who listen to the individual touched during the casting of this spell have their obedience and tendency to follow orders enhanced greatly. Common people generally do as they are told without question (as long as the orders are within the realm of reason). Those who are accustomed to giving orders themselves are much less
