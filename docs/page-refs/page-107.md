# Animál Spells

Animál spells affect all natural living things that are not plants or humans, doing to animals what Mentem and Corpus spells do to people. Animál spells may affect any animal-like mind or body.

To tell if an Animál spell will affect the mind of a creature, determine from the animal's Characteristics if it has Cunning or Intelligence. If the creature has Intelligence, a Mentem spell must be used. If it has Cunning, an Animál spell must be used. When a creature or person who has an Intelligence Characteristic is shapechanged, Animál spells that affect the mind are not effective. Instead, Mentem spells are needed. However, the body of such a being may be affected by Animál spells, including spells like The Falcon's Hood (PeAn 20) and The Immaculate Beast (MuAn 15).

If a human body has animal parts (such as bat wings), those parts can be affected by Animál spells, even though the rest of the body is only affected by Corpus spells.

# Creo Animál Guidelines

The basic range for CrAn spells is Touch. The basic duration is Sun, but vis boosting generally raises this to Instant, except for magical creatures (like griffins), where the duration is raised to Permanent. The basic target is Individual. The addition of five levels generally doubles the number of creatures created.

When creating a magical creature, the Magical Might of the creature cannot exceed the level of the spell, and requisites must be included for any special powers (for example, Ignem if it can breathe fire, Rego and Mentem if it can control people's minds).

To create treated animal products (like leather, jointed meat, and cloth) add one magnitude to the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of dead animal. To create only part of an animal corpse (like hide or horns), subtract one magnitude.

In order to influence the behavior of created animals, a Rego requisite is required. Otherwise they just do what comes naturally.

Level 3: Create the corpse of a tiny animal (Size -5/-4).

Level 4: Create the corpse of a small animal (Size -3/-2).

Level 5: Create the corpse of a medium animal (Size -1/0/+1). Create an insect.

Level 10: Create the corpse of a large animal (Size +2/+3). Create a tiny living animal.

Level 15: Create the corpse of a very large animal (Size +4/+5). Stop the progress of a disease.

Level 20: Heal one Body level of damage.

Level 25: Create a small animal.

Level 30: Create a medium animal. Create a tiny magical beast. Create a swarm of insects. Heal two Body levels of damage. Restore a lost sense. Restore a lost limb. Cure a disease, counteracting its effects.

Level 35: Create a large living animal. Create a small magical beast. Heal four Body levels of damage.

Level 40: Create a very large living animal. Create a medium magical beast. Heal six Body levels of damage.

Level 45: Create a large magical beast. Heal eight Body levels of damage.

Level 50: Create a very large magical beast. Heal ten Body levels of damage.

Level 55: Create a dragon. Heal twelve Body levels of damage.

Level 60: Raise an animal from the dead (Ritual).

# Creo Animál Spells

## General

### Full Health of Beast and Bird

R: Touch, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind, Ritual

Cancels the effects (short of death) of a malign Animál spell, such as The Falcon's Hood (PeAn 20), if the spell is less than or equal to the level of this ritual.

## Level 20

### Soothe Pains of the Beast

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Piece of Amber (+3)

This spell looks much like a ritualistic "laying on of hands" seen in many churches. You kneel and press your hands to the wound while reciting a quiet incantation. The focus, a piece of amber, which is a stone routinely used by common folk both to cure and to protect, you hang from a thong around your neck to give aid in the casting. The animal touched recovers a lost Body level by making a Stamina stress roll of 3+.

Asaron of Flambeau believes his mission in life is to repopulate the world so there will be more to kill, and thus spends seasons healing animals and people throughout Europe. In his version of this spell, a black patch in the shape of a tongue of fire is left where the wound was. A symbolic flame is seen in almost all of Asaron's spells, making it his wizard's sigil.

### Weaver's Trap of Webs

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Spider Web (+1)

In casting this spell, you either point at an area or, if you are using the spell focus, fling the spider web at the desired spot. From this initial location, a huge net of spider webs grows, filling an area 5 paces by
