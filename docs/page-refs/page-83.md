CHAPTER IV
LABORATORY
83

Magical enchantments are created through a type of ritual magic, and therefore require a great deal of time, effort, and magical resources. You must take the time to prepare your lab for the task, gather all the necessary materials and equipment, and then craft your work in earnest, exercising great care with the details of the enchantment. In the end, you have an item that is independent and that generates its own magical energies in order to function, but that is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. Your magical signl figures just as prominently in the effects produced by your magical enchantments as it does in the effects produced by your spells.

It often requires raw vis to create magical enchantments. The process of enchanting an item transforms the vis, linking the magic power inexorably to the item in which it is instilled. Vis used for enchantments is thus transformed so that it is no longer usable for any other purposes, and it can never be extracted from the enchantment it is used to create. Magi sometimes refer to the magic of enchantments as "cooked," rather than "raw," vis.

Because the act of enchantment is itself a ritual, effects matching those of ritual spells may not be placed in any enchantment.

## Enchanted Devices

Enchanted devices come in three types: talismans, which enhance and focus your magic powers; invested devices, in which you instill effects that mimic the powers of spells; and lesser devices, which may be instilled with effects as invested devices but which are more limited in power and require fewer resources.

## Form and Material

The first thing you must do for any magical device is choose the physical form of the item you wish to enchant—both the shape of the item and the item's component material. (Do not confuse the form of an item with the subset of arcane Arts that are called Forms). Look at the Form and Effect Bonuses Table to see what sorts of items have bonuses relevant to the types of enchantments you wish to place. You should also pay attention to mundane criteria as well as magical. Enchanting a gold sword might appeal to you, but such an item would be too heavy and soft to use in combat. And while a diamond might be perfect for your ring, do you have a diamond? You might have to go out into the dangerous world to find your materials, especially if your covenant is poor.

|  Material | Base Points  |
| --- | --- |
|  cloth, glass | 1  |
|  wood, leather | 2  |
|  bone, soft stone | 3  |
|  hard stone | 4  |
|  base metal | 5  |
|  silver | 6  |
|  gold | 10  |
|  semi-precious gem | 12  |
|  precious gem | 15  |
|  priceless gem | 20  |
|  Size | Example | Multiplier  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  tiny | ring, bracelet, pendant, any gem | x1  |
|  small | wand, dagger, belt, cap | x2  |
|  medium | sword, tunic, boots, skull | x3  |
|  large | staff, shield, cloak, skeleton | x4  |
|  huge | boat, wagon, human body, small room | x5  |

Example: To prepare a silver shield for enchantment would require one season and 24 (6 for the material x 4 for the size) pawns of Vim vis.

Before you begin the process of enchantment, you must acquire the item you will enchant, and note its size and composition.

## Preparation for Enchantment

Talismans and invested devices are powerful items that require special preparation before any effective enchantments can be performed on them.

Once you have the physical item to enchant, you must spend a season preparing it. To do this, you must simply expend the time and a number of pawns of raw Vim vis equal to the number derived from the "Material and Size Table" for the form you have selected.

It is possible to enchant only part of an item. For example, you can enchant a ruby on the end of a staff. Because it is on a staff, the gem gains bonuses appropriate to the shape (but not the material) of the staff (see the Form and Effect Bonuses Table), and you don't have to enchant the whole staff. However, any effect that relies on the attachment of
