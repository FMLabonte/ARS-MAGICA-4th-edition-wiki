CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
17

Magica aren't artificially weakened for the sake of arbitrary "character balance."

With great power comes great responsibility. Magi are very demanding characters to play, particularly because others look to them for salvation from dire threats. They are the leaders of the covenant, so when they go abroad with an entourage, they must take responsibility for the fates of all. If a magus is not decisive and practical, he might have to contend with a revolt.

Magi tend to be deficient in basic social skills that are necessary to survive. Ironically, their mystic powers only compound their inability to deal with the mundane world. The Gift of magic, though precious, makes people and animals around magi ill at ease. Because of this, all rolls that magi make to make a good impression on or inspire the trust of mundane people or animals suffer a –3 penalty. Though magi seem superior to other character types, they still rely heavily on the support of companions and grogs.

## Companions

A few exceptional and highly skilled people, called companions, are also associated with the covenant. Some work and live there, acquiring the rank of consortes (kahn-SOR-tays, singular consors: "cohort"). Others are friends of the magi and visit only occasionally. Their motivations in dealing with the covenant vary—this is something you will have to consider when creating a companion.

Companions provide any skills that the magi, in their pursuit of arcane knowledge, have not had the time or inclination to learn. They provide a connection between the esoteric covenant and the mundane world around it, since magi often do not mix well with society. The broad term "companion" can include scholars, foresters, sages, healers, thieves, spies, leaders of grogs, and almost any other profession that you come up with and that the storyguide approves.

## Grogs

Grogs are the henchmen of the covenant, and can be guards, servants, messengers, cooks, carpenters or individuals of any other mundane profession. Essentially, they include all the people who help keep the covenant going but are not central to the saga. Each player makes several grogs, but once created, all grogs are played in common by the troupe. It is common for a given player to play one or more grogs in each story, alongside his magus or companion.

"Grog" is a slang term that has spread throughout the Order, mainly because grogs themselves use it. Elite grogs are called custodes (koos-TOH-days, singular custos: "guardian"), the name magi give to warriors and servants who journey with and protect them. More common grogs simply perform mundane duties at the covenant, rarely straying from its walls. Often, these most mundane of grogs are simply referred to as covenfolk, especially if they are non-combatants.

## Steps in Character Creation

When you create a character in Ars Magica, you will go through a series of steps which are described briefly below and filled out in detail in the coming pages. If you don't understand what to do right now, don't worry—things will be explained in greater depth as you go along. For now, just try to get a general feeling of what you will be doing as you develop your character.

## Step 1: Concept

In this section, you'll build the basic framework for your character. You'll decide what sort of character he will be and what basic function he will fulfill. You will also be determining such defining characteristics as gender, age, and origin.

- Determine character type: magus, companion, grog
- Choose gender, age, and origin
- Magi: select House, record house-specific Virtues and Flaws
- Companions: select vocation (optional)
- Grogs: select vocation (optional)
- Pick a name

## Step 2: Characteristics

In this section, you will determine values for your character's Characteristics, that is, his innate ability in various areas of human endeavor. Characteristics can be determined either through a point-based purchasing system or by random die roll.

- Either purchase or roll and assign your Characteristic values

## Step 3: Virtues and Flaws

Virtues and Flaws are arguably the most important things about your character. They are what make him special and distinct from the masses of Mythic Europe. You will select a number of Virtues and Flaws in such a way that the
