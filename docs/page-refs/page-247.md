# Special Creature Traits

Supernatural creatures tend to have powers that relate to their basic natures. These powers require special rules and terms to account for them in the game.

## Might

Supernatural creatures have Might scores representing their overall power in a realm (divine, faerie, infernal, or magic). Thus, there are actually four different types of Might: Divine Might, Faerie Might, Infernal Might, and Magic Might. A creature's score remains constant, unless it changes as the creature matures. However, it can be effectively lowered when a creature uses its powers. Might has several functions, described below.

- Measures power: The Might score gives you a general idea of how powerful a creature is.
- Indicates realm: Might scores identify the creature's nature. Supernatural creatures can receive bonuses and penalties to their powers when they find themselves in other realms. See the Realm Interaction Chart on page 239.
- Regulates mystic powers: Some creatures have powers that require an expenditure of mystical energy, limiting their use. The Might score is equal to the number of points the creature can expend; if it does not have enough points left, it can't use that power. All points return within 24 hours.
- Affects magic resistance and penetration: Except under special circumstances, a creature gets its Might score as a bonus on magic resistance and penetration rolls. Use the base score for this determination, irrespective of any points expended to use powers.
- Determines effectiveness of spells: Many General level spells only work if their level is equal to or greater than the Might score of the creature to be affected. A weakened ghost, therefore, is easier to control than one at full Might.

## Powers

These are some suggestions for special powers that you can give your creations. Each will vary from creature to creature in strength and other details. Whatever powers you give, however, make sure that they make sense and mesh with the creature's background and natural environment.

Some powers are like spells; this is indicated in parentheses in the creature description. For these, determine a Technique, Form and level equivalent. Even though the creature does not cast spells as a magus does, these stats determine what Arts can resist or counter the power.

- Animal control: The creature is able to command animals of a certain type.
- Constriction: The creature can squeeze opponents to death, causing damage that increases from round to round.
- Emotion aura: Others share the emotions of the creature, such as a satyr that causes those around it to feel wild.
- Entrancement: The creature can bind or control people by staring into their eyes.
- Fear: The creature instills fear in others, either through a horrible or mighty appearance or through a spell-like power.
- Fiery/poisonous bite or breath: Such attacks can cause death, paralysis, insanity, or loss of will.
- Formulaic spells: The ability to cast Hermetic spells, as a magus can.
- Illusion: The creature has the power to change its appearance, and maybe that of its surroundings.
- Immunity: The creature is completely unaffected by certain types of spells or damage. This may be related to the creature's natural habitat.
- Natural weapons: This includes teeth, claws, and other spiky bits.
- Resistance: The creature gets a bonus on magic resistance or Soak rolls against certain types of attacks.
- Shapeshift: The ability to take the form of humans, objects, or beasts.
- Special senses: Like seeing in the dark, or detecting lies or magic.
- Spontaneous spells: Defined with a Technique, Form, and maximum level.

## Weaknesses

Weaknesses can and should be as interesting a part of your creatures as its powers are. They let you throw powerful adversaries at the characters, who can in turn survive by finding and exploiting a vulnerability. Learning weaknesses can be part of a story—an important part if the monster is
