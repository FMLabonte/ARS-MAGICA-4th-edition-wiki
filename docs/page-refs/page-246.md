# Chapter XII
## Bestiary

As storyguide, you will want to use supernatural beings as a means of adding excitement, challenge, mystery, fear, and wonder to your saga. Creating appropriate encounters is your responsibility. Careful thought can turn what might be just another battle into an episode of wonder and fear.

You can certainly use the creatures described in this chapter, but it's better to invent your own, using those provided here as guides. Do not take the design of these adversaries lightly. The characters live in an inherently magical and dangerous world whose appeal depends upon mystery and awe.

# Creature Descriptions

In this rulebook and in supplements for Ars Magica, creature descriptions follow a standard format which varies slightly depending on what statistics and capabilities a given creature has. Most of the statistics are self-explanatory. All creatures have Characteristics. Some have a Might score, and all have a Size. Next come any Personality Traits the creature has—even mundane animals have traits that describe how they react to situations. Combat totals and statistics follow personality traits, and finally, there is a section for Abilities, Powers, and other information.

There are some differences between the statistics of beasts and people. In the case of animals that are not intelligent, their Intelligence Characteristic is replaced with Cunning. Some creatures do not become fatigued (and so have none of the related statistics). You will also note that the levels assigned to Powers do not necessarily match the level guidelines found in the Spells chapter. The level in such cases measures the relative difficulty of countering or affecting the power; it does not indicate that the power is Hermetic in origin.

Combat statistics and other traits, which for characters are based on Characteristics, are handled differently for creatures. For example, Initiative takes Quickness into account, but also depends on the creature's natural adaptations and other abilities. Such scores cannot be derived mathematically from a creature's Characteristics alone; assign them subjectively, based on what seems right to you.

# Designing Creatures

Designing a creature is a challenge, but it becomes relatively easy with practice. You should always begin by asking what purpose it serves in the story. The following items will guide your through the creation process.

- Purpose: Why are you creating this creature? Is it to motivate fear, humor, pity, or awe, or just to oppose the characters in combat? How does it fit into the story and what should it do to advance the plot?
- Image: What does the creature look like? Sound like? Smell like? How does it move? Does it have distinguishing features that set it apart from others of its kind?
- Behavior: What does the creature do, and why? How intelligent is it? What are its goals and motivations? How might it respond to different character actions? Does it have any inherent morality?
- Basic stats: What are the creature's statistics? Does it have interesting Personality Traits?
- Powers and Weaknesses: Does the creature have any mystical abilities, including spell-like powers? Does it
