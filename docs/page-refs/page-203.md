CHAPTER IX
COVENANTS
203

# Spring

Spring covenants are newly created, and have many disadvantages. They usually lack political influence. Other covenants of the tribunal may have a stake in the status quo, and do their best to thwart the actions of newer members. Spring covenants are also likely to have fewer tangible resources, be they things like money, food, and buildings or more arcane requirements like an acceptable library and sources of raw vis. Furthermore, the magi who form such covenants are often younger than other members of the Order, with a corresponding dearth of magical might and experience.

# Summer

As spring covenants gain influence, allies, and resources, they become summer covenants (unless, of course, they fall prey to enemies or simply cannot survive due to a lack of resources—not all covenants make it as far as summer!). They are less harassed by other covenants, because their power is great enough to deal with such threats. Given the respite, their magi make greater magical discoveries and increase their power. This is a time that the greatest covenants begin to see the covenant as a possible threat. These other covenants usually begin to move against the summer covenant, but use subtle measures, and rarely devote their full resources to such machinations.

# Autumn

Covenants who have entered Autumn become increasingly hierarchical. The aging magi attempt to control the new ones that arrive, maintaining their place. This tendency often spills over into a desire to control other parts of the Order outside the covenants. Although they are often successful in their bids for power because of the might that they accumulated in summer, the magi spend so much time on politics that they neglect their research and study. If they are not careful, internal stagnation and corruption will lead to winter.

# Winter

As the magi become greatly aged, winter covenants tend to turn in on themselves, jealously guarding their accumulated knowledge from those who might seek to destroy or to steal it. Although they sometimes appear ineffectual, these covenants are quite dangerous should their ire be raised—they still have considerable resources when they resolve to use them. Eventually, most winter covenants die out, leaving little behind. Occasionally, a winter covenant will shake out of its slumber, moving back into Spring. Other times, a new group of magi will take up where old one left off, creating a new covenant with the last resources of the old.

# Covenant Characteristics

Covenants are quantified by eight characteristics that describe different aspects of the covenant. Characteristics, in turn, are each described by three sub-characteristics, called traits, that define the separate areas governed by each characteristic. While characteristic scores provide a broad look at a large area of a covenant's character, traits are the actual scores that describe specific aspects of a covenant. Characteristics and traits have values that are assigned based on the positive or negative aspect of the area that the trait describes.

For example, one of the covenant characteristics is called Buildings. It describes (predictably) the physical buildings that make up the covenant. The three traits that make up the characteristic Buildings are Size, Quality, and Repair. Each of the four statistics has a value, which can be positive or negative. The values of traits add up to determine the value of a characteristic.

Continuing the example, imagine that the covenant has a large number of decent buildings that are in bad repair.

|  Characteristic Score | Sum of Traits  |
| --- | --- |
|  +5 | 15  |
|  +4 | 10  |
|  +3 | 6  |
|  +2 | 3  |
|  +1 | 1  |
|  0 | 0  |
|  -1 | -1  |
|  -2 | -3  |
|  -3 | -6  |
|  -4 | -10  |
|  -5 | -15  |

Note that characteristics are not bounded at $+/-5$. Continue the progression as far as needed.
