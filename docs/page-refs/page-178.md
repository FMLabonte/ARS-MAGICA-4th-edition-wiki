Soak score, one Body level of wounds is sustained. See the Combat chapter for more details.

As a character takes damage and loses Body levels, he is impaired and eventually killed. Anyone who is Incapacitated and sustains further injuries is killed or wounded so badly that death is imminent and inevitable. Otherwise, characters can recover with proper medical attention and rest.

The Unhurt and Hurt levels carry no penalties, while Incapacitated means no actions are possible. Each other Body level has some penalty that is applied to rolls requiring physical or mental exertion. Individuals with Light Wounds suffer -1, Medium Wounds -3, and Heavy Wounds -5.

Wound penalties affect almost all rolls, and are cumulative with those from lost Fatigue levels (see “Fatigue” above)

## Recovering From Wounds

There are several means for recovering from injuries. Rest and natural healing are effective if the wounds are slight. A Hurt character automatically recovers to Unhurt in one day. More grievous injuries require more specialized attention, as they do not heal on their own in the field. Strenuous activity might even aggravate their severity, especially if they have not been stabilized.

Serious wounds require lengthy rest and care. The Wound Recovery Chart indicates the progress of a character's healing. Roll Stamina + Chirurgy on a stress die, and

Numbers indicate the number of days required to heal to the next lower level. If the result is an X, consult the Catastrophe Subchart.

## Catastrophe Subchart

Roll Stress die + Sta + Chirurgy and consult the following chart.

## Roll Result

0 ...Death
1 ...Coma. Further rolls to determine recovery are at -2, and the time rolled is doubled. You wake up when you drop to Light Wounds, at which point you must make two aging rolls.
2 ...You gain the Flaw Enfeebled.
3-4 ...You are permanently crippled. Amputation may be necessary. Represent this effect with a 3 point affliction (see “Aging” on page 180).
5-6 ...Your wounds fester. Lose a further Body level.
7-10 ...Make an aging roll.
11-12 ...Wounds don't heal correctly—gain 1 Decrepitude point.
13 ...Nightmares and flashbacks torment you for some time to come. For the next (simple die – Brave Personality Trait) seasons, you must make a Stamina roll of 6+ to willingly place yourself in a situation where you might be injured.
14+ ...Slow recovery. Recovery times on the Wound Recovery Chart are doubled.
