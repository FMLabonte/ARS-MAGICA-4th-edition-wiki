HERMETIC MAGIC

# Techniques

## Creo (Cr) "I create"

This Art allows you to produce objects from nothing. It turns dreams into reality. When using a Creo spell, you enter a momentary state of transcendent meditation and contact the realm of Forms, in which all the objects that ever were and ever could be exist as perfect ideas. Your magic finds the proper Form and impresses it on the real world, creating an expression of it. Objects created this way are closer to the world of Forms than are normal objects, so they are always perfect and flawless. You can also use the Art of Creo to perfect things that have deteriorated from their ideal nature, such as to heal a broken arm or to mend a broken vase. Pronounced 'CRAY-oh.'

## Intéllego (In) "I perceive"

Intéllego is the Art of perception. All things in the world are connected to each other, and Intéllego allows magi the ability to see, read, and learn from these connections. Pronounced 'in-TEL-lego.'

## Muto (Mu) "I transform"

This is the Art of transformation and transmutation. Through this Art, magi can direct and control the essential mechanisms of change itself. A transformation is easiest when there is a strong connection between the original object and that resulting from the transformation: for example, it is relatively easy to turn a leaf into an apple. However, turning a leaf (living, flexible, and vegetable) into a sword (inert, unyielding, and mineral) is quite difficult. Pronounced 'MOO-toe.'

## Perdo (Pe) "I destroy"

The one trait held in common by all objects and creatures in the temporal world is that some day, inevitably, they will cease to exist. The magus who understands the Art of Perdo knows this, and uses magic to control the universal process whereby things are destroyed. Aging, disease, decay, and dissolution are all properties inherent to objects and living things and can be drawn out through this Art. Pronounced 'PARE-doe.'

## Rego (Re) "I control"

The Art of Rego allows a magus to regulate matter or compel the actions of living things. One kind of Rego spell might lift someone into the air, and another might make a person act a certain way. Pronounced 'RAY-go.'

## Forms

### Animál (An) "animal"

Animál concerns animals of all kinds, from the fish of the sea to the birds of the air. Animál spells cannot affect people, for they have souls whereas animals do not. Pronounced 'ah-nee-MAHL.'

### Aquam (Aq) "water"

Aquam concerns all manner of liquids. Through this Art, one gains access to the might of a roaring flood and the gentleness of a clear pool. Pronounced 'AH-kwahm.'

### Auram (Au) "air"

Auram is the Art of air, wind, and weather. True flight is only possible through this Art. Pronounced 'OW-rahm.'

### Corpus (Co) "body"

Corpus is the Art of humans and humanlike bodies. It governs the intricate interactions that occur in those bodies with souls, as well as those that once had souls. Pronounced 'COR-poos.'

### Herbam (He) "plant"

This Form concerns plants and trees. This includes plant matter of all types, including that which is no longer alive—like dead wood and linens. Pronounced 'HARE-bahm.'
