CHAPTER VII

STORYGUIDE

look up the total in the appropriate column. Cross-index this with the current state of the wounded character to determine the number of days required to recover one Body level. The same roll is used to determine how long the next level will take to heal, and so on. Thus, a heavily wounded character whose total comes up 10 will recover to Medium Wounds in 35 days, to Light Wounds in an additional 18 days, and will be fully healed in another 6 days.

On a botch, the character recovers at the slowest rate for that Body level, and must roll on the Catastrophe Subchart. A result of 'X' on the Wound Recovery Chart also requires a roll on the Catastrophe Subchart. After the Catastrophe roll, another roll on the Wound Recovery Chart will be required. This can mean another

'X' result and another catastrophe roll, and so on. Rolls on the Catastrophe Subchart are made in the same way as recovery rolls (Stress Die + Stamina + Chirurgy); a botch means the character dies.

# Recovery from Incapacitation

For an Incapacitated character, the outlook is grim—death could come at any time. The player must make two Stamina stress rolls each day (at sunrise and sunset) that the character remains at this level. On a roll of 0 or less, the character dies. A roll of  $9+$  improves the Body level to Heavy Wounds, and recovery proceeds normally. Any other roll means a somewhat worsened condition, and all subsequent recovery rolls are made at a cumulative  $-1$  penalty

until the character either recovers a Body level or dies. If the wounds have been stabilized by Chirurgy (see below), a bonus equal to the chirurgeon's skill applies.

# Chirurgy

Chirurgy is the most common sort of aid for wounded people. With this skill, a character can tend the wounds of another (or himself, at a  $-3$  penalty). Chirurgy is rough-and-ready field treatment, often rather traumatic in itself. However, if injuries are not stabilized, strenuous activity can cause the loss of further Body levels.

When a chirurgeon is tending the wounded, roll a die and add Chirurgy + Intelligence + wound penalty. (For Incapacitated characters, the penalty is -6.) If the total is  $9+$ , the wounded character

immediately recovers one Body level. If the total is  $3+$ , the wounds are stabilized and the wounded person may use the tending character's Chirurgy score when rolling for recovery.

The roll for Chirurgy is usually on a simple die, assuming that medical attention is applied after a battle or accident, when drama is low. However, when tending wounds in the heat of battle, or while on the run from pursuers, the roll is made on a stress die. On a botch the patient loses an additional Body level for every 0 rolled.

Medicine may be used in the place of Chirurgy, both to tend wounds and as a modifier (again, in the place of Chirurgy) on the Wound Recovery Chart.
