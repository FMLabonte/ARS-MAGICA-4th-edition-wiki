CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
21

Verditius are sometimes considered inferior to other magi because of this weakness.

# House Templates

Because each house has its own style, certain Virtues and Flaws are characteristic of its members. These are set out in the descriptions below. Those designated "required" must be taken by all magi that choose that template. Some of these are unique to members of the given house, and are described at length. Those Virtues and Flaws identified as "typical" are common among members of that house, but need not be taken. You will purchase more Virtues and Flaws later in the character creation process. For now, jot down those that you have gained or chosen because of your house and move on to the next step.

Starting Abilities are also set out for each template. Record these, along with the number of experience points allotted to purchase other Abilities. Note that you can deviate from the required Virtues and Flaws, and modify the starting Abilities, with the permission of your storyguide. Storyguides should require a convincing reason rooted in the character's background for such exceptions, however.

In previous editions of Ars Magica, each magus was assumed to have a standardized set of starting Abilities that did not take into account the unique flavor of each of the Hermetic houses. If you wish, instead of using one of the house-specific templates, you may instead use this set of standard magus starting Abilities, listed below. If your saga is set in Mythic Europe, you are still a member of one of the twelve houses. You should choose which one, but do not use any of the specifications from the house templates in this section.

Standard Magus Starting Abilities: Hermes Lore 2, Magic Theory 5, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Standard Magus Starting Experience Points: 3 + age

# House Bjornaer

Starting Abilities: Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 2, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 4, Speak Own Language 4, Will Over Form 1 (see below)

Starting Experience Points: 15 + age

The animal nature of Bjornaer magi gives their magic a unique flavor. Because of this, they have a house-specific Virtue, Follower of Bjornaer.

# Required Virtue:

Follower of Bjornaer (variable): This Virtue is a combination of the effects listed below. Its cost is dependent upon the nature of your heart-beast. If your heart-beast is battleworthy (such as a wolf, a stag, or a bear), the cost of this Virtue is +2. Otherwise, it is +1. Some rare apprentices can take the shape of an inanimate object, called a "heart-shape." Heart-shapes are always natural objects, not manufactured or constructed objects. Possessing a heart-shape makes the basic cost of this Virtue +1.

- Heart-Beast: You have a heart-beast, an animal form you can take at any time without casting a spell. Your master probed your heart to see what shape lay within, making it more a matter of your intrinsic nature than conscious choice. Over time, your human form takes on more and more aspects of your heart-beast, including personality and physical shape. You have a Personality Trait named after the form you take, starting at +1. The score may get higher as you go through the saga, at the storyguide's discretion. The higher the score, the more closely attuned to the shape you are, and the more strongly you identify with it.
- Hidden Shape: Hermetic magi cannot perceive your heart-beast. Spells such as Sight of the True Form reveal your current form (whether your current form is your heart-beast or some other shape adopted through a spell) as though it were your natural shape. Magic of other kinds, such as faerie magic, might detect your heart-beast, at the storyguide's discretion.
- No Familiar: As per the -1 Hermetic Flaw described on page 36.
- Will Over Form: This is a Talent unique to Bjornaer magi. You start with this Ability at level 1 and may raise it by spending experience points. It reflects your expertise at controlling the shape you take, and gives you a bonus to resist spells that change your appearance. When attempting to resist spells of transformation or when attempting to regain one of your normal shapes, roll a stress die + Stamina + Will Over Form. A roll of 9+ means you succeed.

# Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Special Circumstances (+1): You receive a bonus to magic rolls while in wild, uninhabited lands. See page 34.

Gentle Gift (+1): Your connection to animals lets them be comfortable around you. See page 34.

Blatant Gift (-1): Your parens has drawn magic from deep within you; non-magical beings are highly disturbed by your presence. See page 35.
