ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Everyone should play a magus: those who do not have the role of characters from the players' covenant can represent another. Thus, all players take part and may talk, conspire, befriend, or double-cross to their hearts' content. Make room for people to walk around and talk privately. Emphasize roleplaying and diplomacy over dice rolling and combat. Be sure to present some conflict, though, so characters have something to struggle over.

# Vis Hunt

Worth far more than simple gold, raw vis is the commodity magi value most highly. Rumors of vis sightings motivate magi to travel to the far reaches of Mythic Europe in order to obtain even scant quantities of the precious substance.

There are endless variations on the standard vis hunt. Magi must determine whether the vis they seek belongs to another covenant, and if so, whether they will risk political problems by taking it anyway. They must sometimes determine how they can get at vis that is well hidden or well protected. And once vis is acquired, the magi of the covenant must determine how it is to be used.

The search for raw vis gets the magi outside the covenant, where they must deal with not only mundane folk, but also mundane problems. You can use the lure of vis to embroil magi in other matters of your own devising, perhaps more dangerous than they originally intended.

# Mystery

The mystery is a timeless story inspiration. Unlike conventional mysteries, Hermetic whodunits can involve those skilled in the art of magic—a class of person quite difficult to apprehend. Magic used by the culprit can make physical evidence virtually impossible to find. Furthermore, supernatural barriers are bound to hamper characters' progress. These become all the more daunting as they uncover more and more of the truth. If the perpetrator takes refuge in a church, the characters' magical powers will be largely thwarted, and they will have to look to other means.

As in more traditional mysteries, you can create plot twists galore. Remember, when all evidence points to a single person, he is probably innocent. Finally, mysteries can be most disturbing and difficult when the perpetrator is someone the characters trust—like a covenant member or fellow magus.

# Trouble on the Home Front

Sometimes the story comes to the covenant. Making characters move through their own home, trying to solve a problem or capture an intruder, gives them a better sense of the place where they live. It also keeps them from sleeping so easily in their beds at night.

Trouble at home can range to problems with covenant staff to disagreements with local nobility. It might involve clergy as well, bringing the Dominion and all the problems it represents into the picture. Use your imagination—members of the Order of Hermes have quite a few potential enemies.

# Faerie Realms

A story involving a faerie realm lets your imagination run wild and makes every scene memorable. Faeries, after all, have little understanding of the "silly" traditions that humans live by. Even where they do understand, they couldn't care less.

Normal rules of reality do not apply while in the faerie realm. Characters may find they can fly when they think happy thoughts, even floating when they giggle. Things might assume a literal aspect: blueberries might make one sad, and spear grass pierce one's feet. Try to keep both characters and players off balance when dealing with faerie lands. No one truly understands these creatures, because they almost never make sense to humans.

Keep in mind that faerie realms are not always cheery and bright. Most of the time a faerie land mimics its surroundings so as not to be recognized. If war and pestilence surround a faerie area, its inhabitants are not likely to welcome visitors.

# The City Streets

The city is the heart of mundane society and a wide variety of stories can be told within the confines of its walls. Despite their amazing intellect, many magi are ignorant of the ways of normal folk. This is where companions and grogs can shine, taking the lead role in the story.

City adventures usually feature the people who live there in prominent roles. City adventures can be combined with other types of adventures, perhaps with surprising results. What magi would expect to find vis in such a place, for example?
