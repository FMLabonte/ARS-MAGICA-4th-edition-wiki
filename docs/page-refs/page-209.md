CHAPTER IX
COVENANTS
209

You can spend positive points on the enemies of enemies: again, one quarter the cost of such characters as allies. They will help you against the common enemy, but not much more.

**Example:** Voluntas clearly does not like Blackthorn, and David decides that the Autumn covenant is actually an enemy. It is a powerful place, the strongest in the tribunal, and thus is a seven point enemy. Voluntas is not a big threat, however, so he only puts two points into intensity, for a total of nine negative points. He wonders about the other covenants of the tribunal who don't like Blackthorn either, but decides that the enmity is not strong enough to produce a united front yet, so there are no positive points from them. Maybe there will be when Julia finishes her visits.

## Contacts

Contacts comprise the covenant's information and spy network. Pay for contacts at half of their cost as allies (rounded up), with no intensity modification. Contacts will answer letters truthfully, but won't offer any other aid. A somewhat unreliable contact costs half the normal cost (again, rounded up).

Negative points can be taken for having contacts who are dishonest or unreliable, or for having spies in the covenant. A contact who is actively trying to deceive the covenant is worth negative points equal to his positive score, as long as the covenant trusts his information. Spies within the covenant are worth 1 negative point if they only have access to public information, 2 if they can find out anything outside the sancta and council chamber, 4 if they know what is going on in the council, and 6 if they can find out anything. This cost is per spying agency, and may represent several spies, as well as magical scrying devices.

The best practical way to manage negative contacts is to take some negative points and then give the storyguide free reign to develop them.

**Example:** Julia would want some mundane contacts, like the abbot of Rievaulx, and probably a couple of others. David pays three positive points for the abbot, and two points for a minor noble and merchant, for a total of five positive points. In the introduction, Blackthorn clearly knew what was going on, so David decides that they have spies in the Voluntas. He spends four negative points on these, and makes a note to decide who and where they are before any players arrive.

Overall, David has spent thirteen negative and five positive points, so the net total is eight negative points, for a score of $-3$ here.

## Improvement

### Income

An average covenant has no surplus income, but has enough to cover all expenses. For each positive point, you have a surplus of 50 pounds of silver over normal requirements. For each negative point, you have a 50 pound shortfall. This may be interest on a debt (bought separately), or a simple shortfall. 50 pounds of silver is enough to feed the families of 25 peasants for a year, at the level of a freeman or covenfolk, as per the social status virtue. It would support 10 families as prosperous peasants, or two at the level of a landed knight. Note that a covenant with no positive or negative income is assumed to have enough income to support its inhabitants and buildings. This will be roughly 25 pounds of silver per point of building size, or 50 per point of inhabitants.

**Example:** Voluntas offered to fund the purchase of land, despite their debt, so they must have some excess income. However, it clearly isn't vast, since they do have that debt. Thus, David decides to spend one positive point here, for an annual surplus of 350 silver. There should be no problem paying off the debt if the other magi can keep Julia under control.

### Vis Supply

An average covenant has a supply of 30 pawns of vis per year. Each positive point increases this by five and each negative point decreases it by the same amount. It is possible to have a vis obligation, if more than 6 negative points are spent. This supply may be of any Art or combination of Arts, and the troupe should decide on the nature of the source (for example, a magical spring which supplies Aquam vis).

**Example:** Voluntas could have a substantial vis supply but, again, the presence of the debt makes this unlikely. David decides to go for a neutral level, and spend no points here.

### Inhabitants

An average covenant has 6 magi, 20 specialists, and 50 covenfolk. 1 positive point adds a magus, 10 specialists, or
