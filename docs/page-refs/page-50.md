ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

human ways. Now that you have joined human society (or the covenant), you have learned to understand some basic spoken phrases, but civilized life is still a mystery you want little part of. You may only choose beginning Abilities that you could have learned in the wilds or picked up at the covenant (such as how to use a mace instead of a club). You have neither the inclination nor the capacity to learn more refined skills, and have no Speak or Scribe Own Language Ability.

Fury: A violent temper sometimes overwhelms you, sending you into a destructive, uncontrollable rage. You are likely to be provoked by some sort of specific event, such as being insulted, being hurt, or hearing the Order of Hermes disparaged. Roll 9+ on a stress die to avoid flying into a rage when such an event occurs, with another roll every round to try to calm yourself should you fail the first. On a botch, you try to kill everyone around you. While enraged you get +3 to Damage, but -1 on all other scores and rolls.

Mute (companions and grogs only): You cannot speak; perhaps your tongue was cut out. You probably use rudimentary hand gestures and grunts to communicate your needs. Not only is this inconvenient, it can annoy your companions.

Noncombatant (companions and grogs): As per the -2 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.

Sense of Doom: You have gained knowledge best left unknown—perhaps a vision of your demise or eternal fate, perhaps secrets about your true nature. At times you are listless, as nothing can shake your feeling of impending doom. Whenever you are defeated in a meaningful attempt at something, you are incapable of taking any energetic action for up to a day. If forced to defend yourself during this time, you suffer -3 on all scores.

Small Frame (magi): As per the -2 Flaw of the same name for companions and grogs.

-4 Flaws

Dwarf (companions): You are the size of a child. Your comfortable walking speed is two-thirds that of a normal person. Though your muscles are mature, you lack the leverage that benefits larger folk. Even if you are strong, this prevents you from using any weapons that require a positive Strength. Your Size is -2, so you have no Winded or Weary Fatigue Levels, and have no Hurt or Lightly Wounded Body Levels.

Feeble (Characteristic): You are extremely disadvantaged in one of your Characteristics—lower it from -3 to -5. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a ham-handed clumsiness, exceedingly disgusting appearance, or near-immobility.

Plagued by (Supernatural Entity): You have somehow earned the enmity of a powerful ghost, an angel, a demon, or a very powerful faerie. The entity does not harass you constantly, but usually affects you in dangerous ways during important times of your life. When attempting to overcome its victim's Magic Resistance, the entity has +12 on its Penetration roll. The storyguide should decide on the nature and purpose of the entity's plans.

-5 Flaws

Age Quickly: Probably due to a curse or a magical disaster, you age twice as fast as normal people. Your effective age (which applies as if it were your actual age when making longevity potions) increases two years for every year that passes, and you make two aging rolls each year. There is no way to halt or slow this other than longevity potions, and even then two potions are required to modify both aging rolls.

Blind (companions): You have little or no sight. Using missile weapons is futile, reading is impossible, and navigation in unknown territory is difficult to say the least.

Dwarf (magi): As the -4 Flaw for companions and grogs.

Enfeebled (companions): You cannot exert yourself for longer than a few seconds. Any need for rapid movement, such as combat or a chase, leaves you helpless. Long hikes are likewise beyond your capability. You are unable to learn Weapon Skills or any other skills involving physical exertion, since you cannot train in them.

Pathetic (Characteristic): You are absolutely without redeeming value in the area of one of your Characteristics. Lower a Characteristic from -3 to -5. Furthermore, the storyguide, once per session of play, may maliciously initiate some misfortune related to your shortcoming, causing you injury or embarrassment. A character with pathetic Dexterity might accidentally fall down a well, or a character with pathetic Intelligence might unknowingly cut a deal with the enemy to turn the magi over to thieves. Describe what it is about you that makes you so pathetic.

-6 Flaws

Enfeebled (magi): As per the -5 Flaw of the same name for companions, listed above. In addition, you lose double Fatigue levels from casting spells.

Poor Memory (magi): As per the -1 Flaw of the same name for companions, listed above. In addition, it takes you twice as long to learn spells. You begin the saga with half the normal spell levels.

Abilities

Abilities represent what a character can do beyond the basic functions described by Characteristics. They usually represent training or practice in the way that Characteristics represent innate capacity. Abilities are broken down into Skills, Talents, and Knowledges based on the different ways that they can be improved. Skills, Talents, and Knowledges are broken down further into related groups such as Arcane Skills or Formal Knowledges. Each Ability is assigned a score, representing the character's level of expertise. In general, an Ability score of 3 suggests basic competence, 5 represents professional mastery, and scores of 9 or higher suggest folk who are approaching the pinnacle of human knowledge and achievement.

It is possible to gain special Abilities that are not mentioned specifically in these descriptions. These are referred to as Exceptional Abilities. Usually, they are gained by purchasing specific Virtues. They function and improve just like the Abilities listed here. They are not described in this section because they are only available to characters who select the appropriate Virtue. A reference is provided to assist you in finding the rules that cover these special Abilities.
