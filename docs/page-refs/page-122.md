ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

Generates a massive gust of air around you that supports and pushes you along through the air at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. Hovering in place is difficult, and requires a Finesse roll of 9+ per round. It is dangerous for extended travel, because if you lose concentration, you are likely to sustain serious injuries (+15 damage).

## Level 30

### Gathering of the Stormy Might

R: Per, D: Spec, T: Sight

Spell Focus: The Essence of an Air Elemental (+3)

Calls the surrounding clouds into a storm within one hour. The size of the storm depends on the amount of cloud cover available. The storm lasts for a length of time based on the amount of cloud cover present. The duration of the rainfall can vary from just fifteen minutes for thin, wispy clouds to several hours if the sky is already overcast. This spell cannot be used on an utterly clear sky. While this spell cannot be used to make an already exiting storm more severe, it will can be used to cause a gathering storm to break almost immediately.

### Pull of the Skybound Winds

R: Near/Far, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Captured Gust of Wind from a Tornado (+3)

Makes winds rise upward, pulling one object, creature, or person up to 50 feet into the sky before letting that target drop. Even a small building can be torn from its foundation, though such a building can be no larger than 20 feet to a side, and cannot be built out of a material heavier than stout wood. Uprooted objects fall randomly, unless you make a Finesse stress roll of 12+ to choose where the objects will fall.

## Corpus Spells

Corpus spells deal with human or humanlike bodies and anything that involves those bodies. Most faeries have enough in common with humans to be affected by Corpus spells.

In previous editions of Ars Magica, "Corpus" was called "Córporem," but that is the wrong form of the Latin noun. When you encounter spells from earlier Ars Magica products, treat Córporem as Corpus.

## Creo Corpus Guidelines

Many Creo Corpus spells are most useful as permanent spells, which require raw vis. A spell that binds your wounds lets your wounds open again by the next sunrise or sunset if it is cast without raw vis; only with raw vis can permanent healing be effected. Unless otherwise noted, a healing spell cast without raw vis actually suspends the healing process so that upon the spell's expiration, wounds are as fresh as they were when the spell was cast. No Hermetic spell can restore Fatigue levels.

Creo Animál spells may be used as guidelines and examples for Creo Corpus spells. Note that creation of body parts and corpses is usually one level of magnitude higher than corresponding CrAn spells, because of the complexity of the human body.

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 5: Prevent decay of a body.

Level 10: Create an entire human corpse. Stabilize one wound.

Level 15: Stop the progress of a disease.

Level 20: Heal one Body level of damage.

Level 25: Heal the damage caused by a poison or disease.

Level 30: Restore a lost limb. Heal two Body levels of damage.

Level 35: Heal four Body levels of damage.

Level 40: Heal all harm done to a body.

Level 50: Return "life" to a corpse (Ritual)—See The Shadow of Life Renewed.

## Creo Corpus Spells

### General

### Free the Accursed Body

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst. T: Ind, Ritual

Cancels or reverses the effects (other than death) of a malign Corpus spell, such as Twist of the Tongue (PeCo 30), if you can match or exceed the level of the spell with the level of this ritual.

## Level 10

### Bind Wound

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Spider's Web (+3)

Typically, you place your hands on the target and pass them over the wound, which magically seals itself and stops bleeding. If a spider's web is available, it is laid over the wound and disappears as the wound seals itself. Any subsequent recovery rolls necessitated by the wound are made at +1.

### Charm Against Putrefaction

R: Touch/Near, D: Moon/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Piece of Preserved Flesh (+3)

Prevents decay of a human corpse, or of a severed body part. Necromancers use it to preserve their revived corpses.
