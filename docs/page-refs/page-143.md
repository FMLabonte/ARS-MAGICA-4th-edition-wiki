# Rego Imáginem Guidelines

## General

### Restore the Moved Image

R: Near/ Sight, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Icon (+3)

Cancels a ReIm spell that moves an image, putting the image back where it belongs, as long as you can match the spell's level on a stress die + the level of your spell. The icon that may be used with this spell must represent the image that is being restored.

## Level 10

### Illusion of the Shifted Image

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An icon of the target (+3)

Makes any person or object appear to be a pace away from its actual position. The image cannot be placed in a solid object. As soon as the original or image is touched or moves, the spell ends.

### Wizard's Sidestep

R: Per/Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An opal (+3)

Your image appears up to 1 pace from where you actually are, so attacks aimed there are likely to miss you. Whenever the image is successfully struck, it disappears and reappears in another spot.

## Level 15

### The Captive Voice

R: Reach/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Copper Drawstring (+3)

Captures a person's voice and places it in a bag. The person may not speak unless the bag is open, in which case the voice comes from the bag, not the victim's mouth. If the victim screams while the bag is shut, the bag vibrates visibly.

## Level 30

### Confusion of the Insane Vibrations

R: Per, D: Conc/Year; T: Sight

Spell Focus: Quartz (+1)

Everyone within range of your sight seems to see his surroundings vibrate back and forth at varying high speeds. In addition, sounds and scents are displaced and seem to come from the wrong areas. Anyone trying to fight in these circumstances suffers –3 on Attack and Defense scores, and must roll two extra botch dice. People in the area are likely to become desperate and terribly confused. Navigation is exceedingly difficult. The visual effects of this spell are negated if those affected are in complete darkness or if they close their eyes. If you use a Rego casting requisite, you are not affected. Quartz has associations with the moon, and thus with lunacy.

### Image from the Wizard Torn

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+3)

Requisite: Intéllego

A copy of your image separates from your body and moves at your command. It can speak whatever you say and do so in your voice, and you can see through its eyes. Thus, someone watching is unable to tell which is the double and which is you. You must make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll for each solid object the image passes through and for each mile it travels. If you wish the image to be able to leave your sight, you must use an arcane connection to yourself (for example, a fingernail or a lock of hair) when you cast the spell. That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located.

If you wish to grant the image the ability to move under water or through the earth or to fly through the air, you must employ Aquam, Terram, or Auram, respectively as casting requisites, and add +10 at casting to the level of the spell for each ability.

### Haunt of the Living Ghost

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+1)

Requisite: Intellego

With this spell, you can instantly project your own image and voice to any designated spot that you have an arcane connection to (though storyguides may wish to limit this range to some absolute distance like 300 miles). You can see and hear through the image. The image must appear in some medium, such as a fire, mirror, or pool. The spell has a casting requisite of the Form appropriate to the medium in which the image appears.

Some magi use this spell to attend inter-covenant councils without traveling the intervening distance.

## Level 50

### Illusion of the Misplaced Castle

R: Sight, D: Sun/Year T: Str

Spell Focus: An icon (+1)

Moves the image of any building of castle size or smaller up to 1 mile distant from its actual location. The icon must represent the image that is being moved.
