# Fighting from Horseback

There is little doubt that the most powerful figure on the battlefields of Mythic Europe is the armored knight astride a war horse. Fighting from horseback is a great advantage against those on the ground. In addition to the bonuses to initiative, attack, and defense listed on the appropriate tables above, characters on horseback are never encumbered by their equipment. When mounted, their Encumbrance is equal to 0, no matter how much they are carrying.

The comparison of your and the bear's attacks and defenses should be played out by itself, rather than having players involved in other battles rolling their dice before yours are resolved. If a magus in your party is casting a spell to slay the bear, then that magus becomes part of the sub-melee, because the effects of that spell are important to the outcome of your battle this round. Use sub-melees loosely and with common sense—they are a guideline that makes the job of running combat easier, not a rule that should confound you and slow the game.

Each engaged party is required to use the weapon class that he declared in the movement phase, with two exceptions. First, a character may always opt to use Brawling to defend himself against an opponent that he declared the intent to engage, no matter what range the two of them wound up at. Second, if a character finds himself at Touch range after having declared the intent to engage at a greater range, he may use Brawling to attack instead of whatever class he declared, provided that he has either a free hand or some brawl-capable weapon in hand (like a dagger, rock, or sword pommel).

When two combatants are engaged, each combatant rolls a stress die, adding the result to his Attack score. This total is known as the Attack Total. The same stress die result should also be added to the Defense score to give the Defense Total. Any modifiers that a given combatant may be entitled to due to a first strike bonus (see "Movement," above) or advantage bonus (see below) should be added to the appropriate Attack Total or Defense Total as the combatant wishes, and any modifiers from the following table that apply should also be added to the appropriate total.

If a combatant's Attack Total is higher than his opponent's Defense Total, determine the difference. This is the result of this round's exchange of swings, dodges, and maneuvers. That difference may be either applied to a hit
