CHAPTER II
CHARACTERS
49

Common Fear: This is just like the flaw Uncommon Fear, but the thing that frightens you is more frequently encountered. Examples include fires, buildings, and the touch of others.

Curse of Venus: You are very attractive to people whom you do not wish to attract (add +3 to Presence rolls). People you detest keep getting crushes on you, and will not be dissuaded. Furthermore, you tend to fall in love with inappropriate people, and in inappropriate circumstances. These people you are interested in tend to think you are vain and shallow, causing a –1 penalty on Presence and Communication rolls.

Decrepit: You have one Decrepitude point (see page 181) from old wounds or a past serious illness.

Diabolic Upbringing: Your parents were diabolists, and though you have escaped their evil ways, you are still haunted by your upbringing and the memory of acts best left unspoken. Thoughts of demons plague you, and you live in a constant state of dread and hatred. The powers of Hell might have a special interest in your soul. You may purchase the Knowledge Occult Lore, even if you are normally not permitted to buy Arcane Knowledges.

Haunted: You are plagued by a ghost that only you (and those with Second Sight) can see and hear. It insults, berates, and distracts you—especially when you need to keep your cool. It might steal and hide your smaller items, give others near you the chills, or cause a buzzing in your ears that prevents you from hearing clearly. In no case, however, does the ghost have any powers when more than seven paces away from you. The storyguide should use his imagination in making the ghost irritating but not fatal. Yelling can drive the ghost away for a time, but also confuses those around you. Unless you are exceptionally strong-willed, you might have to aid the ghost in its purpose in order to be rid of it. A magus with this Flaw is haunted by a particularly powerful ghost, and therefore has trouble controlling it even with spells. It also often interferes with magical research, giving –3 to all Lab Totals.

Hunchback (companions and grogs): As per the –1 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.

Infamous: People know you well and curse you in their prayers. You have a level 4 bad Reputation, specifying the horrible deeds that earned you such ill will.

Lame: One of your legs is weakened, whether since birth or through some accident. You move slowly and clumsily. Your base speed is a mere one mile per hour, and anyone can outrun you. You suffer a –6 penalty on rolls involving moving quickly or with agility, –3 on Dodge, and –1 on other combat scores.

Lycanthrope: You have been cursed to change form into a dangerous predator (such as a wolf, lynx, or bear) on nights of the full moon. No items or clothing transform between shapes, and it takes one full round for the full transformation to take effect. You are not immune to normal weapons, and the curse does not infect bite victims. The animal may be detected as a cursed human with a InIm 25 or equivalent spell.

You have the intelligence of a animal while changed, react to all stimuli as an animal, and do not retain any memory of actions taken in animal form, save occasionally in dreams. You may not even realize that you are under this curse. You can still recognize both friends and enemies when changed.

Lycanthropes may transform into any non-magical animal between Size –1 (wolf) and Size +2 (bear). You have the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 252), except that +3 is added to your Soak score (in animal form only). Furthermore, you are fully healed of all wounds incurred in animal form upon resuming human form (which happens at dawn).

Missing Hand: Perhaps it was an accident or a punishment in your past that cost you one of your hands. Climbing, combat, and other activities normally requiring both hands are at a penalty of –3 or greater.

Noncombatant (magi): You have no interest or ability in the fighting arts. You cannot learn any Weapon Skills, and suffer –3 on all Attack and Damage scores. You may not learn combat spells (defined at storyguide discretion). You cannot pick Virtues and Flaws relating to armament quality. You may learn and engage in certámen.

Obligation (magi): You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.

Overconfident: You have an exaggerated and unshakable opinion of your capabilities, and you do not hesitate to try things that promise only defeat. If you are convincing in your speech, you can infect others with your overconfidence. You gain the Personality Trait Overconfident at +3.

Poor: You have almost no wealth, and for some reason you can never seem to hang onto the valuables you do gain. You automatically begin the game with inexpensive arms and armor, and whenever you put your hands on something of value, you can bet you won’t have it for long.

Poor (Characteristic): You have an exceedingly bad Characteristic—lower one which is already –3 to –4. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a feeble stature, hideous visage, or slack-jawed stupidity.

Sheltered Upbringing: You grew up completely separated from society, knowing only your parents or mentor. Recently you have been introduced to a wondrous new world of strangers, and you are overwhelmed. Depending on your personality, you might react with contempt, fear, or wonder. You are unable to function normally because you cannot understand most human customs. You suffer a penalty of –3 to most tasks involving social interaction, and you may have no Social Talents or Skills as beginning Abilities. Eventually you may overcome your upbringing.

Small Frame (companions and grogs): You are of a lighter-than-average build. Your Size is reduced by 1. You have no Hurt Body Level and no Winded Fatigue Level.

Tainted With Evil (companions and grogs): As the –1 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above. Mundanes react much more strongly to your atmosphere of corruption.

Terrors: Some specific thing fills you with overwhelming dread. You can do nothing but scramble and fight to flee its presence. If escape is impossible, you are likely to collapse into a quivering heap. The object of your fear is common enough that it will be encountered from time to time, but rare enough that you are not totally incapacitated. Examples include criminals, deep forests, heights, wide open spaces, and caves.

## -3 Flaws

Arthritis: Your joints are stiff and often painful, making almost any prolonged movement difficult. You are at –3 to rolls involving repetitive movement, sustained over time. Occasionally, the pain is so great that you are seriously disabled. On any movement or combat botch, one of your joints may “lock up,” making the limb effectively useless (–6 to all rolls involving it) until you have a chance to rest it for a day or two.

Feral Upbringing (companions and grogs only): You grew up in the wilderness, either raised by wild animals or surviving on your own. For much of your life you could not speak, and knew nothing of
