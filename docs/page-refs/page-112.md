# Level 20

## The Gentle Beast

R: Eye/Near, D: Conc/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Divine Mushroom (+4)

Calms an animal, making it nearly fearless. It does not resist being ridden, shaved, or whatever else you can think of. If the animal enters combat, is extremely frightened, or incurs any kind of wound, the spell ends. The animal must be Size +3 or less. A mushroom picked from Dominion lands puts the serenity of the angels into the animal.

# Level 25

## Circle of Beast Warding

R: Reach, D: Ring/Perm, T: Group

Spell Focus: A stone urinated upon by a lynx (+5)

The caster inscribes a circle that no normal beast will cross. A stone marked by a lynx's urine helps form a territorial boundary to animals.

## Mastering the Unruly Beast

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Lion's Tooth (+5)

You can make an animal perform any act it is capable of as long as it remains within range of your sight (though you must touch the animal to initiate the effect). It is difficult to maintain control of particularly stubborn or fierce animals, such as mules or boars—creatures with appropriate Personality Traits may roll against an ease factor of 12+ each round. As the lion is the king of the beasts, his tooth adds to your ability to command.

When Chavin of Tytalus casts this spell, the creature acts surly and unfriendly while going about its tasks, even when Chavin doesn't specifically tell it to act that way.

# Level 30

## Commanding the Harnessed Beast

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Lion's Tongue (+5)

You implant a complicated command into an animal, which it carries out to the best of its abilities. The command must involve completing a certain task, such as finding a certain person. Vague orders, like "protect me," do not work. If the animal does not complete the task before the end of the spell approaches, it becomes desperately ferocious, especially at night. A lion's tongue gives you royal command over animals.

# Aquam Spells

Aquam spells affect water and all other liquids. They cannot affect liquids in a body, such as blood; that requires a Corpus spell.

## Creo Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Sun (and boosted duration is usually Instant). Basic target is Small.

Water created without raw vis quenches the thirst but provides no lasting benefits to the drinker. Common sigils for Creo Aquam spells include water with a specific scent, color, or flavor.

**General:** Create poison that does +(Level) damage (Corpus or Animal requisite). Create a liquid that does +(Level – 5) damage on contact (Corpus or Animal requisite).

**Level 5:** Fill a man-made container with water (or some other natural liquid, with appropriate requisites).

**Level 10:** Create water (or some other natural liquid) that is not contained (for example, spread over a surface). Create a slightly unnatural liquid.

**Level 15:** Create water (or some other natural liquid) in an unnatural shape (for example, in a sphere over someone's head) or in an unnatural location (like within someone's lungs)—but water so created will behave normally. Create an extremely unnatural liquid.

**Level 20:** Create poison that causes a minor illness.

**Level 25:** Create a small spring. Create poison that causes major illness.

**Level 30:** Create poison that is fatal.
