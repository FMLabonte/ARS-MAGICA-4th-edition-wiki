THE ART OF MAGIC

penalty while they are within the Aegis. The invitation and expulsion must both be issued by magi who participated in the ritual, but not necessarily by the same magus. A magus may only invite or expel specific, known, individuals. He may not expel someone he does not know has been invited in.

The Aegis is typically cast on the winter solstice, since magical auras can be slightly higher at that time, and the Aegis then lasts for the entire next year. The entire covenant usually participates in the Aegis ritual, which often ends with the participants' walking around the perimeter of the protected area in order to define it. Quite often, the covenant holds a major council meeting, or perhaps a large feast, after the ritual of the Aegis.

Aegis of the Hearth was invented by Notatus, the first Primus of House Bonisagus. It was a major breakthrough, incorporating Mercurian rituals as well as Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was chosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is more powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo requisite. By 1220 Notatus's discoveries have spread, and any magus trained in the Order is capable of inventing versions of the Aegis with the above parameters. Inventing a version with different parameters, however, would require a similar breakthrough, and years of research.

## Circular Ward Against Demons

R: Per, D: Ring/Perm, T: Circle

Spell Focus: Pure Red Coral (+3)

When you set up the ring, the storyguide secretly rolls a quality die + the spell's level - 5. All demons with Infernal Might equal to or less than this total are unable to enter the circle or harm those within it. If you cast the spell again, the second ring dispels the first, regardless of the relative strengths. Some magi cast this spell before going to sleep at night. At night, from certain angles, the ring may be seen as a silver-hued dome.

## Maintaining the Demanding Spell

R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind

You cast this spell on a spell that you have already cast and are maintaining through concentration. The spell that requires concentration is then automatically maintained for the duration of this spell, whether you concentrate or not. You cannot change the effects of the first spell without concentrating on it again. For instance, you can use The Unseen Arm (ReTe 5) to hold an object in the air without concentrating, but to move the object still requires concentration. An Intelligence + Concentration stress roll of 6+ must be made in order to cast this spell while keeping the first one going (a lower roll than normal because this is what the spell is designed for). This spell only works on spells of equal or lower level.

## Opening the Intangible Tunnel

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

You can open a magical channel from yourself to some target, allowing you to cast any spell with a range greater than Personal on that target. The tunnel does not, of itself, grant any sense impressions of the target—you must cast appropriate spells through it if you wish to see. Spells cast through the tunnel cannot be of higher level than that of this spell - 20. You must make standard Concentration rolls to maintain concentration on the Opening spell as you cast other spells.

A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through The Invisible Eye Revealed or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the spell.

## Suppressing the Wizard's Handiwork

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Black Onyx (+3)

Cancels one spell that you have cast, but only as long as you concentrate. When concentration is broken the effects of the spell return. The level of the spell to be suppressed must be less than the level of this spell. The effects of the spell being suppressed take about one round to fade out, and then another round to return after concentration is broken. The spell to be affected must be active to be suppressed—in particular, it may not be of Instant duration.

Common uses of this spell include providing access to some place normally blocked by magic (for example, having a permanent MuTe blocking the door to your lab, and then suppressing it to enter), and avoiding traps (such as suppressing a Watching Ward [ReVi Gen] on your rear door). This spell is designed to be held while you do something else, so Concentration rolls are easier than normal (3+ walking, 6+ imminent personal threat).

## Watching Ward

R: Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind, Ritual

Watching Ward puts another spell on a given target on hold until that spell is triggered by a simple condition, which is determined when this ritual is cast. The target of the Watching Ward must be present for the entire casting ritual. When the conditions you specify come to pass, the suspended spell takes effect.

Only one Watching Ward can be placed on any one person or object. The level of the Watching Ward must at least equal the level of the spell held in suspension. You can put multiple spells in the Ward, provided that its level + 10 at least equals the sum of the levels of the contained spells. If Intéllego spells are included in a Watching Ward, they may be used to trigger the other spells. Thus, if you put Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie (InMe 20) into the Watching Ward, you can also put in a spell that is cast when someone lies. An Intéllego spell in the Watching Ward has no effect other than to cast other spells when the proper condition is detected. Thus, in the example, one's breath is not frosty when he or she is caught in a lie.

If someone tries to dispel the Watching Ward and fails, the suspended spell is cast. Flambeau and Tytalus magi commonly put highly destructive spells upon their persons, to be cast if they die so they may have vengeance upon their killers. The Ritual nature of this spell supports the potentially indefinite duration.

A version of this spell with target Room, known as Waiting Spell, is also well known in the Order. It can contain spells up to the level of the Waiting Spell + 5, and is also a Ritual.
