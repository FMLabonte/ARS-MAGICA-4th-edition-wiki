Chapter V
Spells

The Order of Hermes has collected and created hundreds of spells that have been passed down to apprentices and traded among magi for centuries. Those listed here are representative of the most useful, interesting, and exemplary of those spells—in no way are the spells listed here a definitive list of those available. Instead, they should be used as examples so that you may invent spells of your own. Many of these spells serve as good examples for creating other, similar spells. For instance, a spell to turn you into a wolf can be used as a model for a spell to turn you into another animal.

## Spell Format

Each spell has several factors that describe it for game use. They are depicted in the diagram on this page and discussed below.

## Technique and Form

The Technique and Form are listed in the heading the spell is found under. Spells are arranged first by their Forms, then by their Techniques, in alphabetical order. Following each Technique/Form heading are guidelines that will help you create your own spells, as well as help you determine the necessary level to cast a spontaneous spell. Furthermore, each combination of Technique and Form lists the default ranges, durations, and targets that characterize that combination.

Techniques and Forms are often abbreviated by the first two letters of each word; thus a MuTe spell is of Muto Technique and Terram Form. The level is often added after the abbreviation—thus Flash of the Scarlet Flames becomes CrIg 15.

## Title

The titles given are the actual names of spells as known by Hermetic magi. When inventing new spells, try to give them creative names that will add color to the game. "Fireball" is not interesting; "Ball of Abysmal Flame" is—you get the idea.
