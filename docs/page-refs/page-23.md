CHAPTER II

CHARACTERS

Magi Ex Miscellanea usually come from some sort of subset that describes their master's specific tradition. Once you have decided on a group that you belong to within the House, pick Virtues and Flaws that will help fit your style of magic to that group. Some examples, by no means exhaustive, are listed below.

## Typical Virtues and Flaws:

### BEAST MAGE

Beast mages have a strong bond with animals, and are adept at communicating with and controlling them. They often share the peculiarities of the beasts they work with, and are often skilled at shapechanging. Beast mages share much in common with Followers of Bjornaer, but nevertheless belong to House Ex Miscellanea.

Affinity with Familiars (+1): See page 34.

Affinity with Animál (+3): See page 34.

### SPIRIT MASTER

These magi excel in summoning, communicating with, and controlling creatures of other realms. They learn many secrets from conferring with ghosts, demons and the like, and are often driven by their desire to know even more.

Affinity with Spirit Creatures (+2): This bonus applies to all spells that directly involve elementals, magical beasts, ghosts, and other magical beings. See page 34.

Obsessed (-1): You thirst for ever greater knowledge of the worlds beyond, to the point of attempting to control what is beyond your ability. See page 48.

The Symbol of House Ex Miscellanea

## House Flambeau

Starting Abilities: Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 2, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 13 + age

The fiery bent of Flambeau magi is associated with fairly obvious affinities and defects. They often have character flaws like quick tempers and aggressive natures.

### Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Affinity with Ignem (+3): See page 34.

Affinity with Perdo (+4): See page 34.

Infamous Master (-1): Your master's rage got him or her into serious trouble, and other magi anticipate the same in you. See page 36.

Stingy Master (-2): Your master traveled and campaigned too much to teach you consistently. See page 36.

## House Jerbiton

Starting Abilities: Etiquette 1, Magic Theory 4, Organization Lore (Order of Hermes) 1, Parma Magica 2, Scribe Latin 3, Speak Latin 5, Speak Own Language 4

Starting Experience Points: 9 + age

The continual involvement of Jerbiton magi with the mundane world requires both the nature and the skills necessary to interact well with normal people. Members of this House often specialize in temporal pursuits, such as art, philosophy, and diplomacy.

### Typical Virtues and Flaws:

Free Expression (+1): This is appropriate if you are an artist. See page 41.

Gentle Gift (+1): You were chosen as an apprentice in part because your magical talent is not noticeable to others. Otherwise you would have problems fitting into society. See page 34.

Well-Traveled (+1): Many magi of this House are especially familiar with cities. See page 43.

Noncombatant (-2): Most followers of Jerbiton are philosophers rather than warriors. See page 49.
