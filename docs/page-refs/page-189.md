aimed at students who have a particular level of ability. While they are extremely useful for the target audience, those who have less knowledge will be lost, while those who have more will find that the book only covers familiar ground, and thus they will learn much less.

## Writing Libri Quaestionum

It takes one season to write a liber quaestionum. Each book has a Quality, representing how good it is, and a target level, the level of ability at which it is aimed. The Quality of a liber quaestionum is the author's Communication + Scribe + 6. The target level is selected by the author, and can be up to one third of the author's score in the subject of the book.

For example, Quintus decides to write a liber quaestionum about Ignem. He decides to have a target level of 8, the highest possible, so that it will be useful to those who have already studied his summa. It takes him one season, and the resulting liber quaestionum has a Quality of 11.

Copying libri quaestionum is not as time consuming as writing them. A copyist can make a number of copies of a given libri quaestionum equal to his Scribe skill in one season.

## Studying Libri Quaestionum

It takes one season to study a liber quaestionum, and a student may only study a liber quaestionum once, with benefit. The reader of the liber quaestionum generates a Study Total equal to Intelligence + Concentration + Quality – (5 times the difference between the reader's current score and the target level). Note that you may study a liber quaestionum if your score is higher than the target level. If the text is about an Art, the reader gains a number of experience points equal to the Study Total, with a maximum gain in one season of three full levels of Art score. If the text concerns a Knowledge, divide the Study Total by 5 (rounding up) and apply that many experience points. Again, the maximum gain in one season is three full levels.

For example, Tessa decides to study Quintus' liber quaestionum. Her score of 9 in Ignem is one level away from the target level of the book, so she has a -5 penalty to her study total. Her Study Total is 3 (her Intelligence) + 4 (her Concentration) + 11 (the Quality) - 5 (the difference in level) and so she gains 13 experience points.

## Full Level Advancement for Arts

It can be slightly complex to keep track of experience points for Arts, especially when high Art scores are involved. If your troupe wishes to avoid this complexity, you can use an alternate method to determine Art advancement (but you should still use the experience point system for Abilities). The systems listed below will produce results that approximate advancement by experience points as presented in nearby sections, but will vary somewhat. The entire troupe should decide to use either the experience point method or this optional method for the length of the saga.

To use the alternate method, calculate Study Totals as you do using the standard rules. Then simply follow the alternate method below.

**Disputatio**: If the Study Total is three times your Art score or greater, you gain three levels. If it is at least two times your Art score (but less than three times your score), you gain two levels. If your Study Total greater than your Art score (but less than two times your Art score), you gain one level.

**Summa**: If your Study Total is three times your Art score or greater, you gain three levels. If it is at least two times your Art score (but less than three times your score), you gain two levels. If your Study Total is less than two times your Art score, you gain one level. As with the experience point system, you cannot gain a higher score than the level of the book.

**Libri quaestionum**: Libri quaestionum do not work well if you are not using experience points for Arts. However, you could give levels in Arts equal to the magnitude of the Study Total. Be warned that this makes study faster at higher levels.

**Tractatus**: Tractatus do not work at all if you are not using experience points for Arts.

**Studying from Vis**: Compare the Study Total to your current Art score. If the Study Total is three times your Art score or greater, you gain three levels. If it is at least two times your Art score (but less than three times your score), you gain two levels. If your Study Total greater than your Art score (but less than two times your Art score), you gain one level.
