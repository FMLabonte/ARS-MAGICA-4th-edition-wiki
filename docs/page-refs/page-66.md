THE ART OF MAGIC

## Ignem (Ig) "fire"

This Form concerns fire, heat, and light. Fire is the most lifelike of the four elements: it moves, it devours, and it grows.

They can also affect the "bodies" of noncorporeal beings, such as ghosts, as these are maintained in the physical world directly by a spirit's will. Pronounced 'MEN-tem.'
