mals kill, not for survival, but for the pleasure of inflicting pain. Most earthbound demons, and many diabolists, prefer to remain in such areas. They are also typical sites for diabolic churches and covens, and for the summoning of demons. The “Areas of Infernal Power” chart gives an idea of the strengths of the infernal aura in various locations.

Travelers in or near infernal areas often find themselves in foul moods. Outlaws on nearby roads act in particularly harsh fashion—the effects of demonic influence in high concentration. Old wounds, especially those received through malevolence, hurt anew. Old conflicts and personality clashes are remembered again, and possibly reenacted. Of greater concern to magi, infernal auras interfere with the use of magic.

# The Faerie Realm

Faeries are spirits of places, attuned to the natural world. There are faeries bound to forests, caves, lakes, mountains, and oceans—all places primeval. Some, on the other hand,

make their homes in the world of humans: fields, roads, farms, cities, and even churches (though priests hotly deny it). Faeries share the characteristics of their associated places.

The realm of faerie is as diverse and strange as those who inhabit it, and as with all faerie things, appearances can be deceiving. After dawn breaks, a pile of gold may prove nothing more than old leaves, while a single oak leaf can hold within it more magical power than the enchanted staff of a mighty magus.

There are light and dark elements to the faerie realm, represented by the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, respectively. Though different in nature, they are not necessarily opposed; the Seelie Court may rule a faerie area during the day, and the Unseelie Court at night. Moreover, the faerie realm itself can reign over other realms on special occasions. On certain nights almost all the wilderness, and even some of the Dominion, falls under faerie's sway. On these occasions both Seelie and Unseelie leave their forests and burrows to tread the naked earth. Usually only the most powerful faeries can leave their realms entirely, but on these special nights faerie is almost everywhere. At such times it is best that normal folk stay locked up in their homes.
