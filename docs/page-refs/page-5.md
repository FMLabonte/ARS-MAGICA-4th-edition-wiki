CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

about me, and Geoffrey said wicked things about Fulk. His imagination fell far short of the truth.

Yesterday I was summoned again to the abbot, and Fulk was with him once more. The abbot seemed distracted, and told me that I was to leave the monastery and go with Fulk to his home. I was shocked, because the abbot has always preached firmly that monks must stay in their monasteries. I began to protest, but he stopped me, telling me that I was sworn to obedience. I left, but it was not true. I have not taken my vows yet. I could have disobeyed him and remained. Instead I left.

Fulk spoke to me before I left the abbot, and told me that we would leave before dawn. I own nothing, and so brought nothing but my clothes and this book. Fulk met me in the cloister, and we left in the half dark. Fulk quickly led me away from the road, and I heard voices ahead, and saw a camp fire. Fulk led me to the top of a hill, and stood between me and the rising sun.

"Watch and learn," he said, "for this is your destiny." I faced the old man, dressed in the plain white habit of the Cistercians, and for a moment nothing happened. As the sun rose above the horizon, a darkness spread through his robes, and through his hair, his skin became fair, and his body changed, and I thought that a demon had surely possessed him. Perhaps it had. The white habit of a monk became rich robes of deepest blue, decorated with shining silver, and I was frozen to the spot as ice seemed to clutch at my heart. The old man was gone, and a beautiful woman stood before me. The silence of that moment seemed to last forever, as she seemed to gather the disappearing darkness into herself.

"I am Julia, follower of Jerbiton, and I am your mistress." The words broke whatever spell held me there, and I turned to flee back to the monastery, but men from the camp had climbed up behind us, and one of them caught me.

We walked all day, the warriors guarding me so that I could not flee, and Julia leading the way. We camped shortly before sunset, and I watched carefully to see if she would change back. She did not, only performing some ritual. Now, she watches me across the flames, and I see my soul in hell, watching her through the flames for eternity. Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.

The Feast of Epiphany, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.

May our Lord Jesus Christ protect me, the Blessed Virgin Mary send angels to guard me, and Ailred of holy memory intercede for me, for I am in the den of vipers, yea, the very house of robbers.

I am sitting in my room, which is lit by a fire which never goes out. The worm which never perishes will come for me when I sleep, for this is an unholy place, surely cut off from the love of God.

It does not look like the mouth of Hell. It is a stone manor house, well built around three sides of a courtyard, the fourth side closed by a wall with a gate in it. Two towers rise from the rear corners, and there are people busy within it. It even looks something like a monastery, but without a chapel. There is no chapel, and no church in the village. Truly, all those here are lost, and I am among them.

When we arrived it was clear that Julia had come home, for everyone rushed around to make her welcome. She sent a servant to summon a council, and led me to a large chamber in the rear of the house. In this room stood a large table, round like Arthur's, and she sat in a chair finer even than the abbot's, with her name carved on the back. She told me to stand behind her and keep silent. As I waited, the others came.

The first was a man, small and thin, dressed in robes of deep red, the color of blood. He brought with him a smell of burning, and there was ash on his hands. The second was another woman, taller than Julia, and very pale, dressed entirely in white. Her cheeks and forehead were covered with scars in an intricate pattern, as were her hands. In one hand she held a dagger which glittered like ice, and she toyed with it throughout the council. They had entered through the door by which we had come, and I was sure then that I was in a house of demons.

Then a bird, a raven, flew in through one of the windows and settled on another chair. In a moment it had changed to a man, small, with dark hair, who sat naked in the seat, staring at me with hungry eyes.

One chair remained empty, and I fixed my eyes on it to avoid looking at the others, who were talking in Latin, too quietly for me to follow. As I watched, the final councilor appeared in the chair, appearing from nothing amid a stench of rotting flesh. He was robed in rough brown, and his face had the pallor of a corpse. I was about to run, but Julia had seized my wrist, and I found that I could not move. She spoke to the assembly.

"Sodales, this is William of York, my new apprentice. He is under my protection." I am sure that the raven looked disappointed at that.

Then I was sent from the room, and guarded by two of the soldiers who had come with us from the monastery, until Julia emerged to lead me to my room. And now I sit here, and dare not sleep. Oh lord, save me from this place.
