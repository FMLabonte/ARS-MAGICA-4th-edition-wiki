SPELLS

# Level 25

## Weight of a Thousand Hells

R: Eye/Sight; D: Moon/Year., T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Hand of Glory (+3)

Causes the victim to feel the despair, anguish, pain, and sorrow of a thousand sinners in Hell. This is a truly horrible spell, for the victim loses almost all motivation and earthly cares. All he can feel is his own pain—endless, inexorable, and searing. Appropriate Personality Trait rolls suffer a harmful adjustment of –5, and the target suffers –2 on any rolls that require thought or concentration. The target has a strong tendency to do nothing but brood. A hand of glory is the hand of a recently dead convicted murderer and is a very powerful ingredient in many necromantic spells and diabolic summonings.

## Gift of Reason

R: Eye/Sight; D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+1)

Gives the target the ability to reason clearly and understand ideas without the bias or distractions that normally interfere with thinking. A strong commitment to a cause, a strong personality, or a stubborn personality nullifies the effects of this spell. Even a relatively stupid person is able to understand difficult concepts under the influence of this spell. The sapphire used brings wisdom, and is often worn by nobles and rulers for exactly that reason.

# Intéllego Mentem Guidelines

These spells are superb for cutting through the confusion of social interaction and the endless banter of the rabble. The InAn spells that deal with the mind may also be used for ideas and guidelines for this section.

Sigils for InMe spells usually involve information being transmitted in unique ways.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Momentary, and basic target is Individual.

**Level 5**: Sense the state of consciousness of one intelligent being (for example, asleep, awake, meditating, dead, drugged, insane, or comatose).

**Level 10**: Sense a single emotion in a being.

**Level 15**: Sense all of the emotions in a being. Discover the truth of a statement.

**Level 20**: Speak with any one human. Read a person's surface thoughts. Pick a single answer from the mind of a target.

**Level 25**: Read the last day's memories from one person.

**Level 30**: Learn all the information you wish from a person's mind.

# Intéllego Mentem Spells

## Level 10

### Sight of the Transparent Motive

R: Eye/Near; D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A clear crystal (+3)

Detects the general motive most powerfully influencing the target at the moment. General motives are such things as fear, anger, and greed, not specific things like the desire to look good before one's superiors.

## Level 15

### Perception of the Conflicting Motives

R: Eye/Near, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+3)

You can detect the conflicting motives behind one target's actions. Thus you might learn that a guard feels conflict between fear and duty. This spell is often used before application of a Muto spell, since it is usually easier to change a target's emotions after you've sensed them than it is to create emotions.

## Level 20

### Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie

R: Eye/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Almond (+1)

Requisite: Auram

For as long as you maintain this spell, the target exhales a misty breath with each spoken lie. Small bits of ice form on the person's lips if the lie is particularly severe. In winter, when breath is visible anyway, lies produce a greater than normal amount of mist (the mist actually billows out). A target who makes a Communication + Guile stress roll of 15+ can determine whether any given statement will be taken by the spell as a lie. The spell can be defeated through extensive and judicious application of Creo Auram and Perdo Auram spells, and a demon is able to manipulate it in any way it wishes, as demons are the embodiment of deception and are never caught in a lie if they do not wish to be. If the spell focus of an almond is used, it must be crushed during the casting of the spell.

House Quaesitor brought the Order this spell, and it is a very poor quaesitor who is without it.

### Posing the Silent Question

R: Eye/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+1)

You can ask one silent mental question of the target, then detect the answer. The truth of the answer is limited by the knowledge of the target. Questions to the effect of "What would you do if . . .?" often receive inaccurate replies. You are likely to get what the target thinks he would do, not necessarily what he would really do. The target of this spell does not notice the questioning unless he or she makes a magic resistance roll.
