## Extracts from the Journal of Antoninus of Jerbiton, formerly William of York

The Feast of St. Hugh, in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and ninety nine.

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, and Ailred of blessed memory.

May the God of Majesty who has watched over my life watch over the pen with which I write it, lest I stumble in the retelling. I am William, called of York for I was born in that city, and I am an oblate at the monastery of Rievaulx. I came into this world of suffering in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and eighty six, and it pleased God to take my mother to Him at my birth. In my eighth year my father died, and my uncle gave me as an oblate to the monastery, where I have lived since. I shall take my vows as a monk next Easter, and never leave the monastery thereafter.

I was given the book in which I record my life by Fulk of Cîteaux, a monk of our Order. He has visited this monastery many times, and is much in conference with the abbot. He has shown a great interest in me, and I do not believe Geoffrey's suggestion that his interest stems from a mortal sin. I believe that Geoffrey will be a bad monk and bring scandal to our Order, but God alone shall judge.

The abbot gave Fulk permission to grant me this book, and required that I obey his command to record my life. The monastic day is unchanging as the eternal God is unchanging: we pray seven times per day, as the psalmist says, and pass our other time in labor and study of the Holy Bible. There is great wisdom in such simplicity, as St. Bernard says.

I, William, write this with my own hand. Adelard wrote the above with my help. I wanted the opening of this book to not be marred by my poor Latin.

The third day of Advent, in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and ninety nine.

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, and Ailred of blessed memory.

Fulk of Cîteaux visited the monastery today, and the abbot summoned me to a conversation with him. He wanted to read my book, and I brought it to him. He asked me many questions about my studies, and my life as a monk. He seemed happy, but I do not understand what he wanted.

The Feast of the Circumcision, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.

May the Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, blessed Bernard, and Ailred of holy memory have mercy upon me and guard my soul.

I have left the monastery. Fulk of Cîteaux, who is neither Fulk nor of Cîteaux, came for me and took me away. I am sitting by the fire in a camp, surrounded by men of war, and Julia who is Fulk is watching me write from the other side of the fire. I would leave, but I have nowhere to go. Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison.

I shall tell the story of these days calmly. Fulk who is Julia came to the monastery on the Feast of the Innocents. He went to see the abbot, and I was summoned to speak to them again. Fulk asked me more questions, and then stared at me as if he could look into my soul. Perhaps he could. When I returned to the novices they were all whispering
