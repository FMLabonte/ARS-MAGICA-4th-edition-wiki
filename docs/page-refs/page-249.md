CHAPTER XII

BESTIARY

# Sigusen, the Dragon of the Tome

Sigusen is a thin, snake-like dragon with short legs but dexterous forepaws. Forty feet long from snout to tail, he has wings, but no one has ever seen him use them, since he spends all his time in his cave atop a mountain.

Sigusen is writing a great tome on the nature of the universe in an ancient language, and is collecting knowledge of all kinds to support his views. To further his ends, he collects sagas as well. He has several intelligent drakes living with him (perhaps his children) who can take human form. Some say that Sigusen can appear human as well.

Some of the drakes are quite well known as vibrant poets and rakes in the towns they frequent in human form. They seek out scholars and kidnap them, bringing them back to Sigusen for interrogation; scholars can also come to Sigusen for answers to their questions. In either case, though, anyone who doesn't provide interesting information in return is eaten.

Adventure Seed: A companion is kidnapped by Sigusen's drakes, and the other characters must find them to get their colleague back. Perhaps the characters must face the great Sigusen himself, to bargain or to fight.

# The Worm of Abbinton

This creature is 50 feet long, black, and slimy. It has a long head, a cavernous mouth filled with teeth, and three rows of fins down its back. The worm lives in an isolated lake, occasionally devouring fishermen and their boats. It sometimes lumbers ashore for unknown reasons; on land it moves very slowly, except when traveling downhill. Its passage wreaks great destruction on any village it should find.

The Worm of Abbinton has a poisonous breath whose venom is valuable in certain magical experiments.

Adventure Seed: The magi need the worm's poison, but probably aren't powerful enough to kill it. A possible strategy is to provoke the worm to breathe on one of the characters, and then drive it away or flee. The characters can then rinse the poison from the victim and collect it for work in the lab. Who volunteers to suffer the poison?
