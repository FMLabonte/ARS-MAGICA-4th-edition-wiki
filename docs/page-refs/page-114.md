# Touch of the Pearls

R: Touch/Reach, D: Conc/Moon, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Pearl (+5)

Tells you whether a liquid you hold or touch is poisonous, just as a pearl sometimes does. Not surprisingly, having a pearl present makes it very hard to fail when casting this spell.

In Verdan of Ex Miscellanea's version of the spell, poisonous liquids turn a faint green. According to his sigil, all his spells involve the color green. Many of his spell variants have Imáginem or Muto requisites.

## Level 15

### Call of the Rushing Waters

R: Arc, D: Conc/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Divining Rod Made of Hazel (+1)

Allows you to find any natural body of water for which you have an arcane connection (for example, a vial of water from it). Once you cast the spell, you can hear the water while you concentrate. Following the sound eventually brings you to the water, but you must make simple Perception rolls of 6+ to follow the sound accurately (roll once per day for long journeys). If you break concentration, you must cast the spell again (unless it is boosted). A body of water that does not move or that makes little noise requires a roll of 9+ to be traced. If you construct a Y-shaped rod out of hazel wood, you get a bonus not only to the casting roll, but to Perception rolls as well.

## Level 25

### Voice of the Lake

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Rock from the Lake Bottom (+3)

You can hold a conversation with a body of water. A body of water usually knows about things directly in contact with it, such as boats and fish. By the Law of Contagion, any item from the body connects you to the body.

## Level 30

### Enchantment of the Scrying Pool

R: Spec, D: Year, T: Spec, Ritual

Requisite: Imáginem

Turns a body of water into a scrying pool. Innately magical people (including most companions with mystical powers) who look into the pool can see any spot they know of that is within sight of some natural body of water. The view you get is the same view that someone would have from a low boat on the water—either close to shore or far from shore, as desired. Maximum range is 500 miles. This ritual is not entirely of Hermetic magic (and does not conform to the normal InAq guidelines). It is an old Mercurian ritual that has become known throughout the Order.

# Muto Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Small.

Some Muto Aquam spells involve heat and cold, but are not Ignem spells. The distinction is that an Ignem spell uses heat as an intermediary to effect a change, while a Muto Aquam spell effects the change directly. For example, you can turn ice into steam by applying heat with an Ignem spell, but you can probably make the change faster by using a Muto Aquam spell, making the change directly.

You cannot transform liquids within someone's body unless the spell is designed that way (and has a Corpus or Animál requisite).

The guidelines given are for turning water into another liquid, or into ice, or, in general, into another thing that is still based on the Aquam Form. To cause a liquid to change into something that is not governed by Aquam takes one more level of magnitude, in general.

**General:** Change a liquid into a poison doing +(Level + 5) points of damage (Corpus or Animál requisite). Change a liquid into a liquid that does +(Level) points of damage on contact (Corpus or Animál requisite).

**Level 3:** Change a characteristic of liquid within that liquid's normal range (for example, make water pure or stagnant).

**Level 4:** Change a natural liquid into another natural liquid.

**Level 5:** Change a liquid into a corresponding solid (Terram requisite) or gas (Auram requisite) (for example, water to ice or steam). Change a natural liquid into a slightly unnatural liquid (for example, make blue water or strawberry flavored castor oil), or vice versa.

**Level 10:** Change a liquid into an unrelated solid or gas (with requisites). Change a natural liquid into two or more different natural liquids, with the two types separate (although they will mix again normally). Change a liquid into a very unnatural liquid (for example, a shocking pink liquid that causes bizarre hallucinations)—requisites will often be required.

**Level 15:** Change a liquid into a mixture of any liquid, solid (with Terram requisite), or gas (with Auram requisite). Change a liquid into a slightly unnatural solid or gas.

**Level 20:** Change a liquid into a very unnatural solid or gas.

# Muto Aquam Spells

## Level 10

### Lungs of the Fish

R: Personal/Touch, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Powdered Scales of a Fish (+3)

Requisites: Auram

Turns water into air as it enters your lungs, allowing you to breathe water as you do air. If using the spell focus, place a small bit of it on your tongue, and swallow it at the completion of the spell.
