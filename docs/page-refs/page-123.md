CHAPTER V
SPELLS
123

# Level 15

## Gentle Touch of the Purified Body

R: Touch, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Pouch of Healing Herbs (+3)

Stops the progress of any disease of typical strength. It does not remove damage that has already occurred, nor does it cure such dread illnesses as leprosy.

# Level 20

## The Chirurgeon's Healing Touch

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Bloodstone (+3)

The person touched can recover a lost Body level by making a Stamina stress roll of 3+, to which is added the highest Chirurgy skill of anyone who has successfully tended the wounds. Also, subtract the wound penalty from the roll. Does not heal damage from poison or disease.

# Level 25

## Restoration of the Defiled Body

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Garnet (+1)

Removes the crippling or malignant effects of any poison, of any disease, or of premature aging. The effects of natural aging cannot be undone by this or any spell. Garnet is reputed to help against diseases and other afflictions.

# Level 30

## The Severed Limb Made Whole

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Carnelian (+1)

A limb that has been detached from the body can be reattached, but any decay that has occurred on the severed limb remains after the limb is reattached. After a day of decomposition, a limb is weak. After seven days, it is nearly useless and infects the character on whom it is replaced (Stamina stress roll of 6+ or lose a Body level). If it's been severed for more than two weeks, the limb is completely useless.

# Level 40

## Incantation of the Body Made Whole

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Chips from a Unicorn's Hooves (+3)

Heals all damage to a human body at the rate of one Body level per round. You must maintain concentration for the rounds during which the spell is cast. A cloak, blanket, or similar covering must be laid over the target to cast the spell.

# Level 50

## Healer's Ring

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Circle, Ritual

Every round, every person in the ring makes a Stamina stress roll of 3+ to regain a Body level. If a botch is rolled, a Body level is lost. Useful for pitched battles, during covenant defense, and during especially disastrous adventures, although the vis cost is quite high. The ring lasts until the next sunrise or sunset. Wounds healed remain healed with duration Sun as well, unless raw vis is used to extend the duration to Instant.

# Level 75

## The Shadow of Life Renewed

R: Reach, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Requisites: Mentem

Brings the semblance of life to a corpse. During the ritual, healing spells work on the corpse, which is important because the body must be physically whole or else it simply dies again once it is brought back to life. For each day that the person has been dead, roll for aging. When the ritual is complete, roll a die to determine the success of the attempt: 1—body dissolves; 2—body possessed by a demon, faerie, or other supernatural entity; 3—mindless, useless living corpse; 4 or 5—automaton with no Abilities over 3; 6 or 7—automaton, but Abilities as a normal person's; 8—person with self direction but no personality, and somehow dangerously demented; 9 or 10—person with will, but no personality. In any case, the revived person is not truly alive and is unable to gain experience points. Also, the person must make an aging roll at the beginning of each year of its existence, regardless of age. This is the closest that the Order has gotten to raising a person from the dead.
