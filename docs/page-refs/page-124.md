ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

You see the true, original form of any person whose form has been changed or masked. This spell can see through mundane masks and disguises at level 10, and can see through the effects of other spells that are equal to or lower than the level of this spell. A four-leaf clover is said to aid its bearer in seeing through deceptions.

## Level 5

### Physician's Eye

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Garnet (+1)

Determines the general health of a single person. Specific afflictions appear to you as areas of yellow coloration on the person's body. A Perception + Medicine stress roll is required to identify unusual diseases. The ease factor is determined by the rarity of the disease.

## Level 10

### Revealed Flaws of Mortal Flesh

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+5)

You are able to find any medical defects in a person or being that you are looking at. You must possess an arcane connection to the person or being. The sapphire used with this spell is said to provide wisdom.

## Level 15

### Whispers Through the Black Gate

R: Reach/Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

Requisites: Mentem

You can speak through the barrier—the figurative "gate"—that stands between the dead and the living, to one corpse that has not yet decayed into a skeleton. The corpse cannot have been buried in Church burial, nor have belonged to a spirit that went straight to Heaven (for example, a saint or a crusader). The spirit that you speak with is not compelled to tell the truth; you can, of course, find ways to coerce or trick it into doing so. All those around you can hear the voice of the corpse. Green turquoise is heavily associated with necromancy; peasants tend to shy away from one with such an "evil" stone.

## Level 20

### The Inexorable Search

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Feather from the Target's Pillow (+4)

Determines the location of a specific person. To cast the spell you need a map and an arcane connection. After casting the spell, you can move your finger over the map at the rate of one hour per square foot of map. When your finger passes over the person's location as represented on the map, you sense the person's presence. (If the person is not in the area covered by the map, no sensations result.) You can locate the person to within a thumb's width on the map. Thus, a map with a larger scale gives more-precise information. Each casting of the

spell allows for the searching of one map. A similar spell allows you to search for a dead body (Tracing the Trail of Death's Stench).

## Level 30

### The Eye of the Sage

R: Arc, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Griffin's Eye (+3)

Requisites: Imaginem

Lets you see a specific person and what is within one pace of that person. The image is clear enough to allow reading. The vision lasts for an hour or until concentration is broken. At distances over 100 miles, the image grows cloudy and becomes obscured. Each pawn of vis expended in casting can extend this limit by 50 miles.

## Muto Corpus Guidelines

These spells transform people. There are beneficial spells to cast on yourself and your compatriots, and harmful spells to cast on your foes.

Transformations do not usually completely eradicate the original form; something of the original remains. If you turn a fat, one-armed man into a wolf, the wolf is fat, three-legged, and male.

Transformations can have subtle (or sometimes dramatic) permanent effects. Someone who spends a month or more as an animal begins to act and think like that animal. Eventually, weak-willed individuals might lose their human identity altogether. When transformed back into a human, the target might temporarily or permanently retain some feature of the other shape. Someone turned into a rabbit and back might keep a fondness for carrots or retain unnaturally big ears. Transformations are tricky things.

Muto Corpus spells cannot alter a person's mind, so they leave the transformed person's intelligence and knowledge intact. Magi can cast spells while in animal form, but they suffer the normal –15 penalty for casting without hands or voice. The transformed person gains any abilities the animal form has though it may take a day or so of experience to get used to using them.

To change accouterments along with the body involves requisites. For example, you need a casting requisite of Animal for leather worn, Aquam for any liquids carried, and Terram for metal objects worn (including studs in armor). Accouterments are transformed only if they are actually being worn, not if they are just being carried in the hand. Simply put, equipment will not be transformed for one of two reasons: either because you choose not to use the casting requisites or because the storyguide rules that the equipment is not sufficiently part of the target's worn equipment. This untransformed equipment falls to the ground.

When you are under the influence of one of your own shapechanging spells, you may change yourself back by concentrating, but doing so ends the spell.

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 5: Change a small part of a person (for example, an eye or nose).

Level 10: Change a limb of a person.

Level 15: Change the face of a person.
