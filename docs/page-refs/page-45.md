# +3 Virtues

Charmed Life: Fortune protects you from the most terrible injury and harm. Whenever you botch, you may reroll the original roll and take the better result. You should describe in detail how you manage to avoid the terrible fate. The storyguide should also be lenient where there is a chance of your rescue or protection.

Fast Learner (companions and grogs): You get an extra experience point per story and per year (allotted during the summer) because of your ability to pick up knowledge faster than normal. You begin the game with 10 extra experience points to use in purchasing Abilities. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Virtue—it is much more useful in decade- or century-spanning sagas than it is in more short-lived ones.

Giant Blood (companions and grogs): The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.

Guardian Angel: You have learned to hear the words of a divine watcher who gives you practical and spiritual advice. The angel whispers in your ear and tells you what is best for you spiritually, rather than materially. It approves of violence only when there is a holy reason—often difficult to demonstrate. If you act against the angel's advice, it may leave you until you correct your ways. Your guardian angel may help you by bestowing +3 to rolls when you are resisting infernal powers, depending on the current state of your soul. The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, it can hear and converse with you.

Highly Trained: You start with 20 additional experience points that you may spend in any way that you choose.

Large (magi): As the +1 Virtue of the same name for companions and grogs.

Protection: You are under the aegis of a powerful person, usually a noble or high-ranking Church official (though other options are possible, if the storyguide approves). Those who know of your favored status treat you carefully; those who do not often pay the price. You have a Reputation (good or bad, your choice) of level 3, which could be higher if your protector is particularly great or well-known.

Relic: You own a holy relic, such as the finger bone of a saint, with one Faith point in it. This can be built into any other item you possess (a sword, for instance).

True Faith: Through piety and holy devotion you have faith that can move mountains. You have one Faith point and can gain more. For more about Faith points, see page 244.

Visual Eidetic Memory: You remember everything you see as vivid images, giving you an increased chance to recall things and visualize them precisely. You gain +3 to all Intelligence rolls to remember a scene; if successful, you get another roll at an additional +3 (+6 total) to recollect all but the slightest of details.

Wealth: You own land and other valuable things, and have a yearly income of about 700 silver pennies. You can have a mount of your own and automatically start the game with excellent arms and armor.

# +4 Virtues

Destiny: Your life is heading toward a definite, though as yet unknown, culmination, whose nature is hinted at in prophecies and dreams. This sense of purpose gives you the strength to overcome fear, depression, and discouragement caused by anything not relevant to your destiny; you gain +3 on appropriate rolls. If an untimely demise ever threatens the fulfillment of your purpose, then something, somehow, will likely preserve you. You will meet your fate at the proper time, though it may cost you your life. You must have the approval of your storyguide to select this Virtue.

Divination: Divination involves divining the nature, location, and possible futures of people, places, objects, and events through a variety of methods. This Virtue grants you the Exceptional Talent Divination at level 1, which can be improved with experience. Numerous types of divination existed in the 13th Century. This talent gives a character knowledge of only a specific type of divination. Common forms of divination in this era include astrology, analyzing dreams, gazing into fires, crystals, or mirrors, and reading the entrails of animals. Each variety of divination gives similar results, but each requires its own special preparations which must be performed in order to divine effectively. To ask a question the diviner must make a stress roll adding Divination and Intelligence; the result must equal the level of difficulty for the question being asked.

Examples of sample questions with their levels of difficulty are listed below. Note that divination does not imply predestination. A correct reading about the future will only give you the most likely of all of the possible futures.

|  Roll Required | Nature of Question  |
| --- | --- |
|  9+ | Answer one question about a distant person's current fate.  |
|  9+ | Answer one question about an object which is present.  |
|  12+ | Determine the location or fate of a distant object.  |
|  12+ | Determine the basic character of a person  |
|  15+ | Determine auspicious and inauspicious days and times for performing a given endeavor *  |
|  18+ | Determine some important piece of information about the possible future of an individual  |
|  18+ | Determine the likely course of a planned endeavor  |

*If the diviner successfully determines the best day and time for a single endeavor which takes place in a limited time frame (not more than a day) and requires a single roll (for example, looking for a lost treasure, asking a favor of the king, or playing a game of chess with death), then the diviner rolls a simple die, and compares it with the following: 1-6: +3, 7-9: +6, 10: +9. The bonus determined is then added to the roll in question, provided that the endeavor is undertaken at the proper time. The storyguide decides how far into the future the divined time is.

If the endeavor is a long one requiring numerous rolls, like fighting a battle, going on a journey, or slaying a dragon, a successful divination roll gives a +1 to all rolls directly concerning this endeavor. If the diviner botches the roll to determine an auspicious day and time, then they have inadvertently determined the worst possible time for such an endeavor, and all the bonuses listed above are treated as penalties.

Entrancement: You have the power to control another's will. By staring deeply into someone's eyes for several seconds—generally impossible in combat—you can verbally command the person to perform a certain task. Roll Presence + Entrancement against the target's Stamina roll. The person being controlled may get a bonus to resist at the option of the storyguide, according the table below. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Entrancement 1, which can be improved as other Talents can.
