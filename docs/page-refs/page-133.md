CHAPTER V
SPELLS
133

plants in a radius of 10 feet, centered on the caster. If angelica is used as a focus, it is crushed and cast to the winds.

## Level 25

### The Great Rot

R: Near/Far, D: Inst, T: Str

Spell Focus: A Rotten Piece of Wood (+1)

Rots and destroys a large amount of dead wood, up to the amount found in a wooden house or small inn. Wooden structures creak and groan mightily for about a minute before collapsing.

## Level 30

### Treading the Ashen Path

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Black Onyx (+1)

As you walk through a forest after casting this spell, all the plant material 10 paces in front of you and 5 paces to either side withers and dies. Trees are reduced to bare trunks, while their leaves and all smaller plants turn to ash. You can walk for 7 miles with each casting of this spell. Use of this spell in faerie woods is not recommended. The black onyx is said to bring malediction and death. This spell was originally invented by a magus of House Flambeau, and he was awarded a prize for it by his primus.

## Rego Herbam Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small. It is equally easy to control living and dead wood.

**Level 5**: Control an amount of wood (for example, a branch or a wooden weapon).

**Level 10**: Deflect a single attack by a wooden weapon.

**Level 15**: Deflect several attacks by wooden weapons.

**Level 20**: Deflect all known attacks by wooden weapons. Cause a Small amount of wood (for example, a wooden weapon, small plant, or branch) to move around as you direct it, though if it is a rooted plant, it remains rooted.

**Level 25**: Deflect all attacks by wooden weapons, both seen and unseen. Cause a Small amount of wood (for example, a wooden weapon, small plant, or branch) to move around as you direct it (it need not remain rooted).

## Rego Herbam Spells

### General

### Ward Against Faeries of the Wood

R: Near, D: Ring/Perm, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

Like Ward Against Faeries of the Waters (ReAq Gen), but for faeries of the wood. At some angles, at night, the ring appears to be a green-hued dome.

## Level 10

### Repel the Wooden Shafts

R: Reach, D: Conc/Sun, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Staff (+3)

Deflects a single blow of any weapon made of wood, up to the size of a two-handed club. You can deflect a different attack each round. The attack automatically misses, but the attacker still rolls to see if he or she botches (with two extra botch rolls for melee weapons). If you ordinarily carry a staff, it must be tossed aside for the casting.

## Level 15

### Strike of the Angered Branch

R: Near/Far, D: Conc, T: Ind

Aimed: +0

Spell Focus: A Whip-like Tree Branch (+3)

Causes a large tree branch to swing at a target. You must target the spell for the branch to hit; Damage is +10.

### Tangle of Wood and Thorns

R: Near/Far, D: Conc, T: Ind

Aimed: +1

Spell Focus: A small net (+1)

Requisite: Muto

Takes a length of wood that you designate and hurls it at a target (a targeting roll is required). The wood wraps around and immobilizes the target (assuming that there is enough wood), who must make a Strength stress roll of 9+ to break free (one attempt per round). If the victim ever botches, he cannot escape without outside help. If the length of wood has thorns, it does +6 damage when it hits, and again each time the target tries to break free, whether successful or not. When the caster stops concentrating, the target can escape on a Strength roll of 6+. A small net made out of plants and grass aids this spell sympathetically.

## Level 20

### Coils of the Entangling Plants

R: Near/Far, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Small Net (+1)

Animates all the grass and small plants within a field delineated from side to side by your outstretched arms and in front by no more than 15 paces of distance. The plants grab and wrap themselves around the people nearest to them (Strength stress roll of 9+ to break free, rolled once per minute). If a roll to break free ever botches, the victim cannot escape on his or her own. After an hour's time, the plants release their grip and resume their normal ways. With a Concentration roll of 6+, you can release one individual a round.
