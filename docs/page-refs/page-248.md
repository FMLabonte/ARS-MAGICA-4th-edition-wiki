THE ART OF MAGIC

formidable. Like powers, weaknesses should be consistent with a creature's nature, not just tacked on.

## Raw Vis in Creatures

Many supernatural beasts have vis in their bodies, making them valuable to magi. Generally, the more magical and powerful a creature is, the more vis it has. The kind of vis inherent to a creature is not always obvious, however, and not always immediately logical. Use your imagination: many beasts simply have Animál vis, but poisonous ones might contain Perdo, shapeshifters Muto, and earth creatures Terram.

## The Creature's Prerogative

It helps to think of creatures as elements of the story. In this role they are mysterious and threatening, a condition you can simulate with the "creature's prerogative." That is, until the characters know what a creature can and cannot do, you are free to make it anything you want. If a developing story calls for it, you can even give the creature a new power in the midst of an encounter. If you are subtle and imaginative—and if you do it to enhance the story, not just smash the characters—the players won't object.

## Magical Creatures

There are a wide variety of creatures who are part of the magic realm. Some, like spirits, are insubstantial and ephemeral, while the mighty dragons and giants are fearsome in their physical power.

## Dragonkind

Dragons are the most powerful and noble of all mortal creatures. They are so mighty and rare that dragonslaying is the stuff of legends—a task worthy of a hero or archmage. Dragons are highly intelligent, physically intimidating, and often magically potent. There are lesser brethren to dragons as well: worms, drakes and serpents. Worms usually lack limbs, though some have them. Most are not more intelligent that beasts. Drakes have the general form of a dragon (four legs, serpentine neck, batwings), but are much smaller and often misshapen. They are not typically bright, but are more likely than worms to be intelligent. Serpents are glorified snakes, usually having special powers. They are cunning and often can speak.
