THE ART OF MAGIC

tation arises. After all, the players pay attention to the rules too—if the combat rules favor missile weapons, don't the players run out and buy bows? Although you are the storyguide, no one likes a dictator. Be flexible when it's called for.

Come prepared. If you are disorganized, it can break the mood of an otherwise engrossing scene. This doesn't mean you have to spend every waking hour preparing for your session, insuring that everyone has a full color map of his sanctum. Just give the needs of your story some thought before sitting down to the table. The game will be much more fun.

Go beyond the rules. The rules are for keeping characters in line. If your imagination reaches beyond the bounds of the rules, forget them. How enigmatic are faeries whose powers can all be looked up in tables?

# Things Not to Do

Don't play favorites. It's no fun to watch the storyguide and his star player enjoying themselves while you just sit there. Everyone should have his moment in the sun, but no one should be allowed to constantly bask in the light. It is your job as storyteller to keep the spotlight moving from player to player, giving everyone a turn.

Don't forget characters' special abilities. There's nothing worse than having to replay the beginning of an ambush because you forget a companion's Premonitions Ability. Look over the character sheets before a session begins and take a few notes. Better yet, keep a photocopy of each character in the saga. You should know the players' characters as well as you know any other aspect of your game.

A casual jaunt to the next village is no reason to reward a character with a runesword, nor is a night on the town enough to yield a rook of raw vis. There's no sense of accomplishment to be found if the goodies flow like water. Reward characters for a job well done, in proportion to the risks they must undertake.

Don't persecute. Some storyguides get a kick out of destroying players' characters. Players work almost as hard as you do on their creations—don't abuse them without cause. This is not to say that you should not challenge or provide obstacles to characters. Simply let the dangers be in proportion to the character's ability to handle them.

Don't haphazardly break the rules. Even though the rules are a means to an end, you shouldn't overlook them indiscriminately. If you change a rule, even for a single
