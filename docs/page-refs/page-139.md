# Ward Against Heat and Flames

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Scale of a Flame Drake (+3)

Keeps heat and fire at bay, unable to approach within 1 pace of the target. This renders the target immune to damage from flames or heat of intensity less than that of a house fire. The target gets a +15 Soak against all fire-related damage. Any fire that is smaller than a house fire in intensity (that is, has equal to or less than a +15 damage bonus) doesn't penetrate the ward. Such fires simply dim at the protected person's passing and flare back up after he or she is gone.

# Imáginem Spells

Imáginem is the Form of sensations and illusion. By using Imáginem, you can alter what others perceive. Imáginem, however, means "image," not "illusion." Thus, one creates, transforms, perceives, destroys, and controls images, not necessarily illusions. A clairvoyance spell, therefore, is Intéllego Imáginem because it detects real images. By manipulating sensations, however, you can create effective illusions. The Art of Imáginem rewards the creative magus by fooling people into actions they would otherwise shun: for instance, they might walk off a cliff, while their eyes tell them there is a bridge over the chasm.

Stenches and perfumes, tints and stains, color and shadow, melody and cacophony, sweet and sour; all these are perceptions, and so can be manipulated by the Art of Imáginem. An image works on the senses, not on the mind, so an unthinking beast is as likely to believe an image as an imaginative human. Nevertheless, Imáginem spells are still most effective at fouling the communication on which human society depends. Beasts are likely to be fooled by illusions, as are the simpler undead. Demons are very hard to deceive, while faeries often see through illusions and manipulate them to fool you in turn. Certain members of the Church have proven remarkably adept at discerning truth from illusion, though the talent is not dependable.

It is more difficult to mimic a specific object or person using an Imáginem spell than it is to mimic a general image, and requires a Perception + Finesse stress roll. For example, it is easier to imitate a generic gold ring than it is to reproduce the gold ring with inscriptions that the baron presented to his wife on the occasion of their tenth wedding anniversary. The higher the roll, the better you can fool people. You get a bonus to your roll for familiarity with what you are mimicking (~3 for an unfamiliar object, +3 for highly familiar objects or for having the subject available for modeling). For mimicking people, a roll of 6+ lets you fool acquaintances of the person, 9+ lets you fool friends, and 12+ lets you fool close friends and relatives. Use a similar

scale for mimicking objects. If you botch the Finesse roll, you may think the image is satisfactory, but it's immediately seen through once in use.

A ritual for special attention is Eyes of the Past (InIm 20). It sees into the past, and is used, when necessary, to find out who deserves Hermetic vengeance.

# Creo Imáginem Guidelines

These spells create and restore images. It is important to note that Creo Imáginem spells do not create anything that is physically tangible. (You can create the sense of touch in that you can create feelings of warmth, cold, pain, and similar sensations. You cannot create the sensation of actual physical touch.) An image of a bucket will not hold water poured into it, nor will the image of a horse be able to carry a rider. This is often the first (and most important) clue that the image is just an illusion.

The basic range is Reach, the basic duration is Sun, and the basic target is Individual.

Increasing the complexity of a sensory perception, such as making moving visual image or making clear words instead of noise, adds an additional level of magnitude. Making an image move or make noise at your direction as you concentrate adds two levels of magnitude. In addition, very intricate images (for example, an intricately ornamented bridge) are generally one level of magnitude higher as well.

Wizard's sigils can be very obvious in Creo Imáginem spells. The illusions commonly have some small quirk that marks them as belonging to a certain a magus. For example, illusions cast by Fortunatus of Jerbiton often have some small religious icon worked into their structure, due to the manner in which he invents his spells.

Level 5: Create an image that affects a single sense.

Level 10: Create an image that affects two senses.

Level 15: Create an image that affects three senses.

Level 20: Create an image that affects four senses.

Level 25: Create an image that affects five senses.

# Creo Imáginem Spells

## General

### Restoration of the Lost Image

R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Room/Sight

Spell Focus: An Icon (+3)

Cancels the effects of a PeIm spell, such as an invisibility spell, that confounds some sense if you can match or exceed the target spell's level on a stress die + the level of your spell. The icon that may be used with this spell must be representative of what is being restored (for example, of a human to destroy invisibility, a rose to restore smell, and so on).

## Level 10

R: Near, D: Spec, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Mask (+3)
