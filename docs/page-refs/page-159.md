# Rego Vim Guidelines

Rego Vim spells repel demons. Theoretically, it is possible to conjure and control demons through Rego Vim spells, but this knowledge and its use are forbidden by the Hermetic Code. Any who find and dare to use this knowledge face dangers from both the beings they deal with and those in the Order of Hermes who strongly object to such practices.

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

Gen: Ward the target against creatures with Might less than the level of the spell + a quality die. A creature warded against cannot directly affect the target physically or by magical means. A spell of this nature will only ward against creatures from one Realm (magical, Infernal, or faerie—Hermetic magic cannot ward against the Divine). Note that wards against magical and faerie creatures can also be constructed using other Forms, but that those wards are more limited in effect.

Gen: Give the target Magic Resistance equal to the level of the spell. This will add to magi's resistance from Forms. However, two versions of this spell, or versions of this spell and Parma Magica, do not add their resistances. Only the highest resistance counts.

Gen: Sustain or suppress a spell you have cast whose level is less than the level of the Vim spell.

Gen: Create a conduit or container for spells with level less than the level of the Vim spell. A conduit puts you in mystical contact with the target (effective Touch range), while a container will hold a spell for a specific length of time before releasing it.

Gen: Sustain or suppress a spell cast by another with level less than half the level of the Vim spell.

# Rego Vim Spells

## General

### Aegis of the Hearth

R: Spec, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual

This ritual protects a covenant in the way a Parma Magica protects a magus.

If any spell is cast toward the Aegis (originating from outside it) by any magus who was not involved in the Aegis ritual, the Aegis resists the spell. Furthermore, spells that bring objects into the Aegis, including teleportation spells such as The Seven-League Stride, are also resisted unless the caster was involved in the ritual. If the foreign spell cannot overcome the level of the Aegis + 5 + a stress die, it fizzles out. The Aegis is also able to block foreign Intéllego spells, even if they cannot normally be blocked by a Parma Magica.

Magi who were not involved in the ritual and who cast spells within the Aegis must subtract half the level of the Aegis from all their casting and penetration totals. Spells successfully cast have otherwise normal effects (e.g. Ignem spells still do full damage).

Creatures with a Might score cannot enter the area protected by the Aegis unless they have a higher Might than the Aegis's level. Divine creatures are not affected, but magical, Infernal (including demons), and faerie creatures are. When approaching the border of an Aegis, a magical person (including a Hermetic magus) feels a slight tingle in the extremities. Magical, Infernal, and faerie creatures and persons may be brought within the Aegis, if they are formally invited by one who participated in its casting and given a token to represent the invitation. (The tokens are used during the casting of the ritual, and thus conform to the Law of Sympathy.) Such a person is also not affected by the penalty to casting within the Aegis. The invitation may be withdrawn at any time. This does not require retrieving the token or even notifying the individual who is no longer welcome. Withdrawing an invitation will not expel the person beyond the Aegis, but will prevent them from re-entering after they leave (unless their Might is high enough), and subject them to the casting total
