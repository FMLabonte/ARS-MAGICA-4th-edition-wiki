CHAPTER X

MYTHIC EUROPE

237

# Nobility

Nobles usually want magi to aid them in their wars and intrigues—precisely what is forbidden. But often, nobles cultivate friendships with local magi and covenants in return for minor favors. Doing favors for friends does not necessarily violate the Code, but doing so may anger other magi or mundanes.

Followers of Jerbiton who are of noble descent may still feel loyalty to their families and traditional allies, and may even feel that they are bound by oaths of fealty. Some attempt to maintain their lives as nobility alongside their lives as members of the Order. Again, they face problems from magi who feel that the Order should be isolated.

Many covenants are located near or within the lands of nobles. Usually, magi seek to have pleasant relations with such people, as a wrathful enemy can be a threat to even a powerful covenant, and retaliation can quickly escalate into open warfare. Most often, covenants and nobles politely ignore each other, but some develop policies of mutual aid in times of crisis.

# Cities

The Order is of two minds about cities. Some magi are quite interested in them, finding that in cities they can interact with great minds, purchase supplies that are of use to them, and find items of great worth. On the other hand, many magi resent the intrusion of the Dominion that cities often bring, and distrust mundanes in small groups, much less in large masses.

As is understandable, those who don't care for city life shun it, and those who are so inclined take up city life. Many magi of the Roman Tribunal have abandoned covenant life altogether, and live happily in various cities in Italy. Some magi even teach at universities.

# Magical Items

There was a time when magi could sell magical artifacts to mundanes without restriction. That period was ended in 1061 by a treaty which regulates the sale of such devices. Under the provisions of the treaty, magi may only accept money for arcane services from consortes. Consortes, therefore, must act as go-betweens to other mundanes. The treaty also stipulates that any magic sold must eventually wear out and lose its power.

# Other Wizards

There are many in Mythic Europe who practice magic of one form or another, but are not members of the Order of Hermes. Alchemists, amulet-makers, hedge wizards, and fortune-tellers are largely ignored, even if they have actual magical powers, because they usually have limited power and no greater ambition than comfortable survival.

Some hedge wizards, on the other hand, have greater ambitions, and will work in the court of the most important noble they can impress. As long as they act discreetly, the Order usually leaves them alone. If, on the other hand, such magicians are obviously powerful and indiscreet, they are usually invited to join the Order and abandon their demeaning position. Those who decline the offer are killed.
