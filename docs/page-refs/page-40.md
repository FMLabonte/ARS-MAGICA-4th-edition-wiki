THE ART OF MAGIC

mortal blood in your veins. You may refer to the supplement Faeries for further information.

Type of Faerie Blood (pick one):

Goblin Blood (+1): You are descended from the dark faeries who rule the lands of darkness and cold. You are short, squat, and ill favored by humanity. Your Presence and Communication cannot be higher than 0 due to this dark nature. Still, it is not without benefit. You can see in the dark as if it were twilight, and you get +1 to all aging rolls. You also get +3 to all natural resistance rolls for those spells you want to resist.

Sidhe Blood (+2): You are descended from one of the noble Sidhe who rule the lands of Summer and sunlight. You get +1 to all rolls to avoid afflictions due to aging, and +3 to all natural resistance rolls for those spells you want to resist. In addition, because of the striking and unusual qualities of your nature add +1 to your Presence, even it brings you total over +3. Many mortals may consider you fascinating or alluring.

Characters with this Virtue can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.

Immunity: You have an innate resistance to some sort of affliction. Add the cost for the degree of immunity, the commonality of the affliction, and its deadliness to determine the cost of this Virtue.

Degree of Immunity:

+3 to Soak rolls: +1
+6 to Soak rolls: +2

Total immunity: +3

Commonality of the Affliction:

Very Common (the average person comes into contact with it on a weekly basis): +1

Uncommon (the average person comes into contact with it once every few months): 0

Rare (the average person comes into contact with it once a year or less often): -1

Deadliness of the Affliction:

Inconvenient (like fevers, flus or the common cold): -1

Debilitating (like mild poisons or varieties of the plague): 0

Crippling (any effect that has a permanent effect but does not kill): +1

Deadly (any effect that can reasonably be expected to kill the average person) +2

Knack: You have an innate aptitude that gives you a positive modifier on rolls using a specific Ability. Whenever you use the appropriate Ability, you get the bonus, which is equal to the value of this Virtue. Knacks are never cumulative with other Virtues that grant bonuses to die rolls—you get the highest applicable bonus, not the sum of them. You may not purchase Knacks in Arcane Abilities or Affinities unless you are specifically permitted as a result of your membership in a particular house. You may not spend more than three points on a given Knack.

Magic Item: You begin the game with a magical artifact, perhaps an a heirloom or an item gained on an earlier adventure. The item can range in power from a minor trinket to one created in the laboratory of a magus; the cost is +1 per 10 levels of spell effects invested in the item, with a minimum cost of 1. You may also buy other types of items: talismans cost +2, potions cost +1 per 10 points of Lab Total invested into their creation, and longevity potions cost +1 per 5 points of Lab Total invested in them. Longevity potions purchased in this way have been made by someone else, and you are not able to make more without developing a new formula.

Purifying Touch: You have the ability to cure a certain type of affliction by touch. The cost of the Virtue depends on how common and how severe the affliction is. For each person purified, you must spend one Fatigue level. This can be a divine gift (like English rulers' ability to cure the King's Evil, scrofula), a faerie power, or an inherited ability. You should determine the value of this Virtue in collaboration with the troupe or storyguide. In general, +1 would allow the curing of such diseases as common colds and minor fevers. A +3 Purifying Touch is required to be able to heal life-threatening diseases, and a +4 is needed to cure the most heinous of diseases.

## +1 Virtues

Alchemy: You are skilled at creating potions, poisons, and elixirs, as well as refining alchemical substances. You are also familiar with alchemical techniques like distillation and fermentation. Alchemy is especially suited for some purposes, so bonuses apply when making certain types of potions: poisons are made at +5, antidotes at +4, healing and health potions at +3, and transformations at +2. Choosing this Virtue confers the Knowledge Alchemy 1, which can be improved as any other Knowledge.

Ambidextrous: You can use either hand equally well. You never suffer the -3 penalty for using a weapon in your off hand.

Animal Companion: You are accompanied by a loyal, intelligent (but mundane) animal that can obey simple commands. Your relationship with it is very close. If it should die, you would be profoundly upset.

Animal Ken: You have a profound empathy with animals that allows you to understand their motivations and feelings. This engenders a solemn love and respect for beasts of all kinds. If you have the Gift, animals are not bothered by your presence. By stroking and speaking softly to a wild (but not enraged) animal, you can tame it to your touch in a matter of minutes by successfully rolling Animal Ken + Perception against an ease factor of 9. In addition, you may apply one third (rounded up) of your Animal Ken score to Animal Handling rolls. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Animal Ken 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.

Arcane Lore: You are privy to Hermetic knowledge, so you can choose Arcane Knowledges (normally restricted to magi) as beginning Abilities.

Beginning Vis: You start the saga with some vis stored up. Perhaps it was a gift from your mentor, or gained on some earlier adventure. You have seven pawns of vis related to any Art and can take this Virtue more than once. The storyguide may want to change this number to reflect vis availability in the saga.

Berserk: You are capable of entering a blinding rage when in combat or frustrating situations. You automatically gain the Personality Trait Angry +2 (or more, at your option). Any time you lose a Body level or wound an enemy, roll a stress die and add your Angry score. A roll of 9+ means you go berserk. The storyguide can also call for a roll when you are strongly frustrated. You may deliberately try to go berserk. In this case, you only need a 6+ when you lose a Body level or wound an enemy, or a 9+ if you have not been wounded or caused a wound. While berserk, you get +2 to Attack, Soak, and Fatigue scores, but suffer a -2 penalty to Defense. While berserk, you cannot retreat, hesitate to attack, or give quarter. If you are still berserk when there are no enemies present, you attack your friends. You may roll once per round to calm down if you desire, requiring a stress die + Perception - Angry to be a 6+.

Book Learner: You have a talent for comprehending the writings of others. When studying from books, treat them as if they were two Quality levels higher than they actually are.

Busybody: You usually know everything that is going on among your friends and acquaintances, especially in private matters. You are
