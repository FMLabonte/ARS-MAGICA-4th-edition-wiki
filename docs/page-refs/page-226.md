# The Drive to Adventure

Many nobles have grown bored with their lot in life, now that the age of barbarian invasions is over. Though many nobles are content to slip into a useless life, some are unwilling to succumb to decadence. Doughty knights, in the flower of their youth, choose instead to venture into the far lands to the north or east. For them, the hunger for adventure is unquenchable; without dragons to hunt, crusades to fight, heathen lands to convert, and infernal taints to cleanse, there is no reason to live.

# The Church

The Church is the first line of defense against the ever-present threat of the infernal powers. Men and women of the Church are the vassals of God; they cannot be taxed, cannot be drafted in wartime, and are subject to the laws of the Church (canon law) rather than those of the local lord or town.

Those entering the holy service must choose one of three paths, described below.

- General clergy are priests who minister to the flocks of Christendom and serve their lord, the pope, in a strict hierarchy. As all Christ's disciples were men, so are all those who minister in the general clergy (a priest is addressed as Father). They live among lay people of their own station, from the bishop or cardinal who tends the souls of great nobles, to the simple parish priest who baptizes, weds, and rings the bells for the peasants of a village.
- Monastic clergy live apart from the world in holy retreats: monasteries and convents. They must adhere strictly to the rules of their order and need care for no other law, not even that of the pope. They are called monks and nuns (Brother or Sister if you are talking to one).
- Lay clergy have taken the first holy vows, but they are not yet confirmed in Christ forever as a priest, monk, or nun. They must obey all full clergy as their betters and their masters, but have the same rights. Lay clergy do not have to live in a monastery, convent, or church, and have taken no vows of celibacy.

# The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy

The pope is the vicar of Christ on Earth, second only to the powers of Heaven. Next come the cardinals, who elect a new pope, usually one of their own, when the old one dies. Archbishops are the chief clerics of large and important lands, while bishops are the chief clerics of cities. Below the bishops are the vast numbers of ordinary priests, whose station varies according to the size and prestige of the church and lands they serve, and according to whether they run the church themselves or assist a higher cleric.

While piety and faith protect many of the clergy from the power of the Devil, they are often the primary targets for temptation and corruption. The soul of a cleric may be harder to obtain than that of a commoner, but it is worth far more for its potential to corrupt a whole parish. The most attractive targets among this holy flock are those country priests too ignorant and unlettered to read the Mass, much less save a soul, and those bishops and cardinals who would rather fight wars and plot political intrigue than pray.

# Monastic Orders

Monks and nuns are bound by a great oath to follow the Rule of their holy order, a set of sacred laws set forth by its founder. Rules are different for different orders, and monks and nuns wear robes and hoods of varied patterns, sober blacks, or shades of brown and white, to show which order they belong to.

Some orders accept only men; some take both men and women. Every order is based on similar ideals: prayer observed throughout the day and night; withdrawal from the evils of the world; and celibacy. Generally monks and nuns live in separate institutions, though there is a lot of gossip about what goes on behind the walls.

These orders often hold their own lands, some as extensive as those of dukes and earls; the lord of a monastery or convent is called an abbot or an abbess. Those who have forsaken the sins of the world are holier than the most pious lay person and the most powerful archbishop alike. Monks and nuns answer only to their abbot or abbess. Because many monasteries are extremely wealthy, after generations of gifts and bequests and the profitable labor of the brethren within, abbots and abbesses have to deal with many temporal concerns, from political relations with the local nobles to rivalry with other monasteries and the meddling of bishops.

As true monks or nuns are the holiest of all people, so are false ones the most debased. Their souls are highly prized by the servants of the Dark One. While most live in pious chastity, an unholy few lie on silk sheets, eat foods as rich as those enjoyed by any king, keep lovers, and sometimes even deal with infernal powers. Lecherous and luxury-loving monks and nuns are the subject of a thousand jokes and as many tales of horror.
