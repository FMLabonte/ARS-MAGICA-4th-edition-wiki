CHAPTER IV

LABORATORY

you from having to find a copy), invent a variant of a spell listed there, or you can make up something completely on your own.

If you want to duplicate an existing spell, use the statistics given for it in the Spells chapter, but include your wizard's sigil (see "Sigils" on page 60).

If you create a variant of a spell in the Spells chapter (change its range, say, or allow it to affect a different kind of target), first refer to the spell that you are basing your spell on. Then determine whether you are changing the spell's range, duration, target, or a combination of those. The new spell's level is determined based on how radically the new spell is different from the old one. The method for determining the new spell's level is described under "Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets" on page 104.

When you invent a completely new spell you must describe it fully, both in terms of its mechanics (range, duration, and target) and how it fits into the medieval paradigm. You must make sure that it takes into account the limits of magic (see page 67). To determine the new spell's level, you must first determine its Technique and Form. This should be a matter of common sense. Next, refer to the general guidelines for that Technique/Form combination, found in the Spells chapter. This will provide a list of what sorts of effects

correspond to each spell level. Once you have determined this base level, check the default range, duration, and target for your Technique/Form combination. If you would like your spell to have a different range, duration, or target, refer to the guidelines for changing them under "Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets" on page 67.

For example, say a magus wishes to create a spell that lights a fireplace. The spell is obviously Creo Ignem—it creates fire. Turning to the guidelines for Creo Ignem, we see that igniting something flammable (like wood) takes a level 5 spell. We also see that the basic range for Creo Ignem is Near, the basic duration is Momentary, and the basic target is Small. The magus wishes to be able to do this from across the room, so the range Near makes sense. He wants it to set logs on fire, but the magic need not sustain the fire—wood will burn by itself once ignited. The duration is therefore Momentary, as per the default. The magus decides that the target Small is not large enough to ignite the large fireplace in his covenant's great hall. Therefore, he must move the default target of Small up one step to Individual, adding five levels. The final level of the spell, then, is 5 (the basic level of the effect) + 5 (to move the target from Small to Individual), for a total of 10.
