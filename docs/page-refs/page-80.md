# Chapter IV Laboratory

Amagus spends much more time in his laboratory engaged in study and other activities than adventuring in the lands outside the covenant. There are Arts to study, books to write, spell to invent, and items to enchant. Time between stories is recorded in seasons, each of which is enough time to accomplish a single long-term laboratory activity. Each of those activities is described in this chapter.

## Basic Laboratory Activities

You use one sum, called the Lab Total, frequently in calculating your ability to accomplish various laboratory tasks. This total varies from task to task because it uses the Technique and Form appropriate to the task at hand. For instance, your Lab Total when learning a Rego Terram spell includes your Rego and Terram scores. Spell requisites might also apply, as can other modifications, depending on the specific activity.

Your basic Lab Total is:

TECHNIQUE + FORM + INT + MAGIC THEORY

## Arcane Studies

Knowledge of Magic Theory and the magical Arts are important to magi—so much so that many spend their entire lives in study. Magi may increase their Art scores in several different ways. Each is described in turn in the

"Experience and Advancement" section, which begins on page 185.

## Spells

Formulaic spells are a major measure of your power because they determine those things you can do easily and predictably. As a magus, you may learn the spells of others and invent your own.

## Learning Spells

If another magus has written out a spell and you have a copy, you can try to learn it. The notes of most magi are incomplete, so learning spells from their private grimoires is difficult (see "Translating Spells," below). Assuming that you can read the spell in question, you can learn it in one season if your Lab Total equals or exceeds the spell's level. You get a bonus to your Lab Total for knowing a similar or variant spell (see "Similar Spells," page 69). If the spell is of the General level, your Lab Total is modified by +1 for every five levels of the spell you already know.

In addition to learning spells from written copies, you can be trained in individual spells by magi who know them. See "Training" on page 187.

Requisites listed as part of a spell's description count for learning spells just as they do for casting them.

## Inventing Spells

Inventing a spell is more difficult than learning one, but of course you don't need a copy of the spell to do it. First, decide the effects of the spell you wish to invent; you may pick a spell described in the Spells chapter to invent (to save
