# Level 35

## Ball of Abysmal Flame

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: The Heart of a Fire Drake (+3)

This spell creates an apple-sized ball of fire in your hand. When you throw it (up to the range of the spell), it bursts into flame as soon as it hits something, doing +30 damage. Anyone within 5 paces who looks at the burst must make a Stamina stress roll of 12+ or be blinded for one round (or permanently on a botched roll). You can hold the ball in your hand for up to three rounds before throwing it. After three rounds, it flickers out.

Marius of Tremere's version of the spell causes the ball to make a loud bang when it hits the target. His sigil is a gaudiness in his spells.

## Circle of Encompassing Flames

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+1)

Creates a circle of flames 6 feet high. A Targeting roll is needed to encircle someone. The circle begins at a 1-pace radius, but you can make it shrink to a pillar or grow to a 3-pace radius as you concentrate if you cast with a Rego requisite. Anyone moving through the flames takes +20 damage. You cannot move the center of the circle. The cat's-eye gem is associated with the sun.

## Intéllego Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small.

Level 4: Sense one property of a fire. Locate a fire.

Level 5: Sense all mundane properties of a fire. Become aware of all fires within the target area. See a fire with which you have an arcane connection.

Level 10: Sense all mundane properties of ash. See a fire you have an arcane connection to and all things it illuminates (for example, see a campfire and everything within its circle of light).

Level 15: See clearly through raging fire (an Auram requisite may be necessary if smoke is present as well). Learn the magical properties of a fire.

Level 25: Speak with a fire.

## Intéllego Ignem Spells

Level 5

Tales of the Ashes

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc T: Small

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+3)

Lets you see what the ashes you touch originally were, and how and when the object was burned, as long as the object is no larger than Small. The latter two are divined from markings and signs in the ashes.

## Shadows of the Fires Past

R: Per/Sight, D: Conc, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Lump of Coal (+1)

Allows you to see where fires have been in the past lunar month. Each casting allows you to detect a single fire—the most recent that you do not already know about. A light red flickering haze appears where the fire was, and you gain an intuitive sense of when the fire was there. This spell does not look into the past, but detects the traces of fire. This spell can be cast outdoors, in which case it detects fires in a room-sized area adjudicated by the storyguide.

# Level 20

## Vision of Heat's Light

R: Per, D: Sun/Moon, T: Sight

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+3)

Allows you to see the heat of objects that are of human body temperature or hotter. Excellent for use in the dark, but it doesn't give true vision.

# Level 25

## Words of the Flickering Flame

R: Reach/Near, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: Ashes in Mouth (+3)

Allows you to converse with a fire, commonly very chaotic and distractible. Promising a fire more fuel might keep its interest. Fires are mostly aware of what they've burned, but they have a limited awareness of what goes on around them as well.

# Level 35

## Eyes of the Flame

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Lets you see a fire up to the size of a large campfire to which you have an arcane connection. You can also see all those things which the fire illuminates.

## Muto Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

Level 3: Change one characteristic of a fire within the target area (for example, make a fire burn more brightly, or produce more smoke).

Level 4: Totally change a fire into another natural fire (changing any or all of its characteristics).
