item. The Watching Ward is not invested into the device, but cast on it for protection. You therefore cannot detect a Watching Ward in your preliminary investigations of an item. If you do not cast a spell to detect a Watching Ward, discovering it often means tripping it. Beware.

## Arcane Experimentation

The preceding enchantment rules assume that you are being careful with your laboratory work and staying safely within the bounds of what you know how to do. If you wish, however, you can test your limits and experiment with new and possibly dangerous techniques. You can experiment when inventing a spell, creating any magical enchantment (device or familiar), creating a potion, or investigating an enchantment. In any case, you have the chance to perform feats that are normally beyond your capabilities, but you also run the risk of failing utterly, perhaps dangerously.

## The Experimental Premise

At the beginning of each season, consider the project you're working on and decide whether you want to experiment on it. If you do experiment, add a simple die roll to your Lab Total. This bonus represents the fruits of the risks you take. However, you must also roll a stress die on the "Extraordinary Results Chart" for each season that the project involves. If you experiment over multiple seasons, inventing the same spell or instilling the same power in a device, the chart results for each season accumulate and apply to the whole project. For example, if it takes two seasons to invest a power into your staff, you have to make a roll on the chart each season. Both results affect the staff or the power you're investing into it.

## Exceptional Risk

You may choose to push your limits even further, adding from +1 to +3 (your choice) to the die roll; this bonus is called your risk modifier. When you do this, you must add the risk modifier to all your rolls on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," and you get a number of extra botch dice on your rolls equal to your bonus.

## Extraordinary Results

Some of the results listed on the "Extraordinary Result Chart" require some interpretation. When interpreting these results, consider the magus's sigil, specialties, and weaknesses. Also take into account the type of spell or

power being worked on, and the Laws of Magic. The more aspects of magic that you bring together, the more interesting the result is.

When referring to the "Extraordinary Results Chart," roll a stress die, adding your risk modifier (if any). If you roll a 0, roll one botch die, plus a number of botch dice equal to your risk modifier. You also get one additional botch die for each point in your magic aura.

## Inventing a Spell by Experimentation

Points from the simple die, added to your Lab Total, might let you finish a spell sooner, or even invent a spell that is otherwise beyond your capacity. If your spell comes out flawed or difficult to cast because of your roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart," you have two choices: live with the anomaly, or reinvent the spell. If you reinvent it, use the normal spell invention rules. However, you gain your Magic Theory score (your score at the time of your experiment) as a bonus to your roll to accomplish the invention, having learned something from your nearly successful experiment. Thus, your Magic Theory score is applied twice to your reinventing Lab Total. The reinvention process must occur in another season.

If even with the added simple die your Lab Total is still lower than the spell's level, you cannot invent the spell, and must still make a roll on the "Extraordinary Results Chart." Even though your experiment fails, it can still blow up in your face. Having failed to invent the spell, you may try again next season, and may experiment again.

## Invested Devices Created by Experimentation

Even with the added bonus of a simple die, your Lab Total may not meet the level of the effect you're investing. In that case, you lose all the vis involved and must still roll on the "Extraordinary Effects Chart." You may try again next season, though, and may experiment again.

If your Lab Total is high enough to invest an effect, but the effect turns out to be flawed (as determined by a roll on the chart), it still "takes up space" in your device, just like a normal effect. Even if you can get the flawed effect out of your device, it still denies you the points of vis it "occupied" in the item. Thus, if you risk experimentation and make a mistake, you can permanently limit the effectiveness of your magical item.
