Requisite: Muto

Earthen hands from beneath the target, rise out of the ground, and grasp the target's ankles. The target can avoid the hands on a Quickness stress roll of 12+.

To break free requires a Strength stress roll of 15+ if both ankles are caught, and a roll of 12+ if only one is caught. (One attempt is allowed per round, and each requires a Fatigue roll.) Each hand can be destroyed by beating its +25 Soak roll (hacking weapons do double normal damage). Each hand has one Body level

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Spell Focus: The Glove of a Convicted Thief (+3)

Takes an item weighing up to 3 pounds and teleports it instantly to a sack or pouch you are holding. The spell does not work if the item is worn, held, touched, or seen by anyone but you, or if it is a living thing. You must know exactly what and where the object is. Casting requisites: appropriate Form for the object stolen.

## Level 30

## Crest of the Earth Wave

R: Far, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Vial of Water from a Tidal Wave (+5)

Creates a wave in the earth that starts at your feet and travels 100 paces in a designated direction. It starts as a narrow ripple and within 5 paces reaches its full size of 5 feet high and 30 paces wide. It moves about 50 paces per round. Those caught in its path must make Dexterity stress rolls of 9+ to leap over the wave, or they are tossed aside and take +10 Damage. The wave overturns trees and damages buildings in its path.

## Earth Shock

R: Far, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Lava from a Recent Volcano (+3)

Shakes the ground in a 100 pace radius. All affected by this spell must make a Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 10+ or fall. Apply these modifiers: standing still, +2; on solid stone, +2; moving slowly, +0; on earth, +0; running, –2; standing on a narrow bridge, –6.

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: Earth from a Deep Cavern (+1)

Creates a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long, 10-foot-deep crack in the ground. It opens on one round, stays open for another round, and closes at the start of a third round, crushing all within it for +25 damage. You must maintain concentration for all three rounds, or the pit slowly closes, over an hour's time, rather than shutting quickly and violently. To avoid the pit, those in its vicinity other than the caster must make a Quickness stress roll of 9+. Falling in incurs +10 damage. To escape, another such roll is made. Unless outside help is provided, people in the pit only get one chance to escape.

## Level 35

## Creeping Chasm

R: Far, D: Spec, T: Spec

Aimed: +6

Spell Focus: Earth from a Deep Cavern (+1)

Creates a chasm that runs from the ground in front of your feet towards some target within range that you designate. The chasm travels about 4 paces per round, growing slowly wider as it travels, reaching a maximum width of 20 feet at a distance of 30 paces. The chasm is 20 to 30 feet deep, and the sides are likely to collapse, so any caught in it are in a bit of a bind. To avoid the growing chasm, a target must make a Quickness stress roll of 9+. The chasm closes naturally in a week.

## Level 75

## Hermes' Portal

R: Arc, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Creates a magical portal through which people, animals, and objects can travel instantaneously. The ritual must be conducted simultaneously at two different locations, and after the ritual is performed, there is a magical connection between them. The magi conducting each ritual must have an arcane connection (such as a clod of dirt) to the other location when they are conducting the ritual. The portal is activated by some command word or ritual determined when the portal is enchanted. Inanimate things and unwilling creatures may be transmitted if someone else says the command word, and pushes the subject through.
