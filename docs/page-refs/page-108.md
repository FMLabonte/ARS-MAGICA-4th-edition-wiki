ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports, the webs can hang vertically, forming a wall; otherwise they act like a net. When the webs are through growing after a few seconds, they are as thick as string and as strong as iron. Everyone caught in the area of the webs is immobilized. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll of $12+$, or someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Contrary to widespread rumor, fire is ineffective against these webs. Webs may continue to trap victims in the future, as long as they don't decay and aren't completely hacked apart.

## Level 50

### Curse of the Ravenous Swarm

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Bound, Ritual

Calls a swarm of locusts or other destructive insects upon an area, which destroys wild plant life and fields. When the spell's duration ends, all the insects disappear, leaving nothing but the damage.

## Intéllego Animál Guidelines

The basic range is Touch, the basic duration is Concentration, and the basic target is Individual.

When you try to get information from an animal, remember that its memories are gathered through its particular senses, with their particular strengths and weaknesses. For example, dogs remember much about odors of various things, but often forget details of how they looked. Animals do not remember human words, but might remember tone of voice and such. You may not get the exact information you are looking for.

To communicate with an animal, you must bring yourself to the animal's mental level—a process that might have strange, though temporary, effects on you. For example, you might have a craving for raw meat or speak very slowly for a moment after communicating with a bear.

Since Animál includes aspects of both Corpus and Mentem with regard to beasts, guidelines that apply to the latter two may apply to Animál. InCo and InMe may be referred to for additional ideas.

**Level 1:** Get a mental image of an animal.

**Level 5:** Sense the state of consciousness of a beast. Get general information about its body.

**Level 10:** Sense the dominant drive of a beast. Learn a specific fact about its body.

**Level 15:** Learn the origin, age, and history of something made of animal products.

**Level 20:** Speak with an animal (Auram requisite for birds, Aquam requisite for fish). Read an animal's surface thoughts.

**Level 25:** Read the recent memories of a beast.

**Level 30:** Thoroughly probe the mind of a beast.

## Intéllego Animál Spells

### Level 5

#### Image of the Beast

R: Arc D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+5)

Gives you a hazy mental image of an animal you have an arcane connection to. If a sapphire (commonly associated with wisdom or knowledge) is used with this spell, the image of the beast is seen within the stone.

All spells cast by Chavin of Tytalus can be recognized because they promote or advocate war or violence. In his version of this spell, the claws and teeth of the beast appear more dangerous.

### Level 10

#### Shiver of the Lycanthrope

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Silver Necklace (+3)

You feel a sudden shiver if you are touching a person or beast that is actually a lycanthrope. You may change the target of this spell (determining information about more than one individual) as you concentrate. If you use a silver necklace when casting the spell, the necklace becomes extremely cold against your flesh.

### Level 15

#### Vision of the Marauding Beast

R: Touch, D: Mom/Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+3)

By touching wounds created by a beast, you get a mental image of the beast from the perspective of the person or creature attacked—handy for finding out what killed your horse. If the victim didn't see the beast, you can't see it either. If the attacker wasn't a beast, the spell refuses to function (though you must make a spell roll anyway to check for a botch, and you lose any vis spent). If the wounds are on a person, this spell requires a Mentem requisite. A cat's-eye gem helps you focus on the attacker, as such gems are attuned to the nature of all predators.

### Level 25

#### Opening the Tome of the Animal's Mind

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Tail of a Sphinx (+3)

You touch the head of the animal in question and read its memories of the past day. The further the animal is from human, the harder it is to read its memories accurately. If you simply scan the beast's memories, not looking for anything special, you get the memories the beast thinks are most important. If you are trying to get a specific fact, you need a Perception stress roll of $6+$, or $12+$ if the fact is obscure. Since normal animals are sensitive to magic, they resist your touch and try to shy away from you both when the spell is cast and while the
