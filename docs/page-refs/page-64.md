## Hermetic Magic

In the 8th century the wizard Bonisagus developed a universal theory of magic and the Order of Hermes was born. The most immediate advantage of Hermetic magic was that it allowed wizards of diverse magical backgrounds to share their knowledge. Before Bonisagus' theory, the practice of magic had been highly individualized and therefore limited in scope. With the ability to share and accumulate knowledge, Hermetic magi gained an immense advantage over other wizards. This universal theory is not without its disadvantages, however. Detractors of the system believe that the strict regimentation of Hermetic magic robs truly brilliant magi of the chance to discover the modes of magic power that best suit them, and that it is truly helpful only to mediocre magi who need an exact system to guide them.

The Order of Hermes is only a part of the greater magical world. There exist non-Hermetic magi from European traditions, whose magic can be quite powerful in specific areas but is less flexible than that practiced by the members of the Order. There are rumors that groups of wizards from Araby and far-off Cathay use magic that is quite different even from the non-Hermetic magi of Europe. Be this as it may, the rules presented here cover Hermetic magic only. Storyguides should feel free to create non-Hermetic magic that governs monsters, wizards, and magic items that do not fit the paradigm set out in these rules, and thus keep magic a mystery even to those who think they know it all.

Hermetic magic is a highly useful but not entirely perfect theory. These rules reflect the things that magi expect to happen when they work with magic. While the expected usually occurs, the exact effects of magic can be influenced by countless factors, including such vagaries as the phase of the moon, the spiritual nature of the target, and the mental state of the caster. This allows storyguides to occasionally bend the rules and interpret magical effects imaginatively.

# The Hermetic Arts

The term "Arts" refers collectively to Techniques and Forms—two classes of magical disciplines that work together in spellcasting. Techniques govern the essential manipulations that magic can perform; Forms, the essential natural phenomena that magic can manipulate. Techniques and Forms have Latin names. A Technique is referred to by a verb conjugated in first person, and a Form by a noun. You combine one Technique and one Form to cast a spell, and together their names indicate the spell's general function. For example, a "Creo Ignem" spell employs the Technique of "Creo" ("I create") and the Form of "Ignem" ("fire") and produces light, heat, or fire. A "Muto Ignem" spell ("Muto"="I transform") transforms light, heat, or fire in some way, such as by increasing its intensity, its size, or its shape.

Hermetic magi have a score in each Art, just as if it were an Ability. Your scores in the Arts represent your aptitude for working with the various types of magic. But Arts are not merely knowledges; your Arts are ultimately ways your very being expresses magical energy. In reflection of this, your score in a Form (in addition to allowing you to cast spells incorporating that Form) helps you resist spells of that type and avoid harm from mundane sources related to that Form. For instance, your Ignem (fire) score gives you a bonus to resist damage from fire and cold.

In the following two sections, each of the Arts is listed with its common two-letter abbreviation, its translation from Latin, a general description, and its Hermetic pronunciation.
