## Mythic Europe

This chapter provides an overview of Mythic Europe—its lands, people, and institutions. It is not all-encompassing, because such a treatment would exceed the size of this book. Nor is it an entirely historical look at medieval Europe. This is not, after all, the Europe of textbooks; it is the Europe of myth, where the legendary is true.

This chapter will not only provide some of the harsh facts about life in the Middle Ages, but will also help you evoke the period's flavor and charm. Here you will find the basics of medieval society. You will get a look at the ways of medieval thought. You will read about the geography and politics of the land.

Although Mythic Europe is the "official" setting of Ars Magica, you are certainly not required to set your saga there. Other fantasy settings are possible, and while the Order of Hermes is strongly rooted in the history of Mythic Europe, it is certainly feasible to adapt the history of the Order to the history of your own world to make them compatible. The bottom line is this: Ars Magica is your game, set it where you will.

## Why Mythic Europe?

Most fantasy games start with the premise that the game world is in some way similar to our own history. Ars Magica goes farther by setting the game squarely within that milieu. There are several advantages to doing so.

- Familiarity: Most people have some idea of what life was like in medieval Europe. The more they already know, the less you will have to teach them.
- Detail: Thousands of years of history and legend create a more lush game background than the most dedicated storyguide can hope to invent.

- Background: An unbelievable wealth of resources for game detail, from court fashions to political plots to exotic legends, is available for free at your local library.
- Verisimilitude: It is a constant struggle to make stories seem as real as possible. A setting based on history is full of real people, real places, and real events whose outcomes have direct impact on the world.
- Color: Reality can be stranger than fiction. You will find Mythic Europe to be as exotic a fantasy setting as you have ever read.

## The Medieval Paradigm

Ars Magica requires that you forget many modern concepts. Such values as equality, tolerance, and the separation of Church and state were largely foreign to the medieval European mindset. This mindset is what we call the "medieval paradigm."

The premise of the medieval paradigm is that the world is the way medieval folk perceived it; their fears, dreams, beliefs and legends are manifest. This means the stories and myths of that time are true within the game setting. Faeries live in the fields and forests. Demons tempt the weak-hearted. Magi cast potent spells. Kings derive their right to rule from God.

Mythic Europe isn't entirely like its historical counterpart, but it is certainly close enough that what you know of
