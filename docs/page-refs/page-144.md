# Mentem Spells

Mentem spells govern thoughts, emotions, and memories. Intelligent minds are affected by Mentem spells, while the minds of beasts are affected only by Animal spells.

Normal people often have better than normal resistance against spells of the mind if they are especially dedicated, impassioned, or desperate. For instance, a parent defending home and family might get a +3 on rolls to withstand a malign spell, or get a resistance roll where one is not normally applicable. The storyguide should use his discretion to determine when to apply this rule.

Since the effects of Mentem spells are not usually visible, they give you a great deal of power when dealing with the common folk. Even spells requiring eye contact are relatively inconspicuous when cast without voice or gestures, but only powerful magi can cast spells this way in the Dominion.

# Creo Mentem Guidelines

In addition to healing minds, these spells can also create thoughts, emotions, and memories in another person's mind.

Typical sigils for Creo Mentem spells involve some small quirk in what is created. A specific idea may lie in the background of all memories created, for example.

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Sun, and basic target is Individual.

Level 5: Form words in another's mind.

Level 10: Put a thought into another's mind.

Level 15: Create an emotion in another's mind.

Level 20: Create a memory in another's mind.

Level 25: Effectively increase another person's ability to think.

# Creo Mentem Spells

## General

Return of Mental Lucidity

R: Touch, D: Inst, T: Ind, Ritual

Cancels the effects (short of death) of a malign Mentem spell if you can match or exceed the level of the spell with this ritual's level + a stress die.

## Level 5

Words of the Unbroken Silence

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Clear Crystal (+2)

Lets you say two words directly to the mind of a target. The target can recognize your voice and knows that the message is of supernatural origin.

## Level 15

Panic of the Trembling Heart

R: Eye/Sight, D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mouse (+1)

Creates an overpowering fear in one person of a specific object, person, or place.

Rising Ire

R: Eye/Sight; D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus A Ruby (+3)

Makes the target furious at someone or something of your choice. A stress roll of 9+ using an appropriate Personality Trait (like Calm) can hold the anger in check, but it is felt strongly regardless of the roll. The ruby is associated with Mars and war.

## Level 20

Memory of the Distant Dream

R: Eye/Sight; D: Sun/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sprig of Rosemary (+1)

Inserts a full and complete memory into a person's mind. If the target gives the memory some thought and concentration, and makes an Intelligence roll of 9+, the memory is revealed as false. When cast with the spell focus of rosemary, which is commonly associated with good memory, the herb is crumbled, and then blown toward the victim.

Pains of the Perpetual Worry

R: Eye/Sight; D: Moon/Season, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Onyx (+3)

Gives someone a nagging, taunting, painful emotion—a recurrent sense of anxiety, a fear of something he or she does not know, a fear of everything, and a fear of nothing. To have this spell cast on you is truly a curse. Onyx keeps sadness away from the wielder. By crushing it during the casting, you are able to sympathetically bring sadness to the target.
