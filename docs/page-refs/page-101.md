CHAPTER IV
LABORATORY

to the point that they are no longer fit for Hermetic training.

Being taken away by a magus to parts unknown is always disturbing and frightening to a new apprentice, even to one excited or relieved to be free of a miserable living situation. Some children chosen for apprenticeship are kidnapped by their masters, some are coaxed away with promises of knowledge and power, while others are actually offered (or sold) to magi by families who cannot handle the youngsters' strange ways. Though most children chosen to be apprentices come willingly and freely, the Code of Hermes does not require that they do. Strictly speaking, magi are allowed to obtain apprentices in whatever manner they wish.

## Training Your Apprentice

Once you have your apprentice, the training begins. Each year, according to the Peripheral Code of Hermes, an apprentice is guaranteed at least one season worth of training. If you do not provide this training, the apprentice is free to go to another magus, and you lose all that you have invested.

Use the rules in the Experience and Advancement section of the Storyguide chapter to train your apprentice, remembering that you must spend at least one season a year directly teaching. Keep in mind that you should try to impart a broad base of skills—refer to the house templates in the Character Creation chapter to give you an idea of what level of apprentice competence you should be shooting for.

You'll need to start with basic skills, like Scribe Latin, before your apprentice can even begin to learn more. Magic Theory is also important, not only for your apprentice, but for you—after all, the more he knows the better help he will be in the lab.

Of course, you don't have to do all of the teaching yourself. Your apprentice can study from books that you have, and you can certainly "farm out" your apprentice to others in the covenant to learn certain skills.

## Fleshing Out Your Apprentice

The basic benefit that an apprentice provides you is the addition of his Intelligence and Magic Theory scores to your Lab Totals (see page 94). If all you want is a lab assistant, you only need to keep track of your apprentice's Intelligence and Magic Theory scores, and after fifteen years, your apprentice becomes a full magus and leaves your service.

However, if created as a full character, an apprentice can be developed as the saga progresses into both a very

important companion to your magus and a valuable member of the covenant. To create your apprentice as a character, determine Characteristics, Virtues and Flaws, and Abilities for a character of young age. You will want to leave some Virtues and Flaws open for Hermetic Virtues and Flaws that become manifest as the apprenticeship continues. Choose Abilities that the character learned in his childhood. As the saga progresses, update the apprentice's Abilities, magical Arts, spells known, and other statistics as you train him, just as you would those of any other character.

## The Value of an Apprentice

Aside from performing many tedious mundane tasks for you, such as cleaning up your lab, your apprentice helps you in the laboratory, adding his Magic Theory to your own. See page 94 for more details on how an apprentice can help you in the lab.

## The Apprentice in Play

A fully developed apprentice makes a playable character. If you want to play an apprentice, keep in mind that you have no natural niche in the story. Grogs fight, companions provide skilled assistance, and magi have powerful spells. As an apprentice you are outclassed in all areas. Nevertheless, some stories are made exciting by an apprentice character or characters, as apprentices are interesting individuals, especially if there's no magus around to overshadow the apprentice's magic with his own.

When you are a magus and teacher, some of the best roleplaying opportunities for your apprentice arise when he is interacting with you. To encourage this, you may want to let another player roleplay your apprentice, or you may consider your apprentice a troupe character to be played by different members of the troupe at different times, much as a grog is.

## The End of Apprenticeship

Normally, an apprentice leaves after fifteen years of service, though one can leave at any time with the master's permission, or after learning all fifteen magic Arts. In some traditions, an apprentice must undergo a battery of tests by a tribunal of magi before being officially recognized as a magus; this famous "apprentice's gauntlet" has come to be dreaded by many a student.
