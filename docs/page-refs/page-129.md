SPELLS

# Level 25

## Awaken the Slumbering Corpse

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Green Turquoise (+3)

Causes a corpse to function at your verbal command. Commands have to be very simple, like “attack anyone who comes through here.” Use the statistics on page 253 for zombies (if some flesh is still intact) or skeletons (if most flesh is gone). The corpse used cannot have been buried by Church ceremony.

## Strings of the Unwilling Marionette

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mannequin of the Target (+3)

You can control the physical movements of a person, such as walking, standing, and turning. If the target resists the control, the movements are jerky. The target can yell, but you can prevent intelligible speech by controlling the target’s mouth. The target must be conscious to be moved about. A Strength stress roll of 12+ allows resistance, rolled each round.

# Level 35

## The Leap of Homecoming

R: Per/Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+1)

Teleports you, or one you touch, back to the one place you know best (probably your laboratory), provided it is within 150 miles. You must have an arcane connection with the place you are leaping to, such as a tile from the floor, or a chunk of the wall. The opal is the stone of Mercury and is thought to bring good journeys.

## Seven-League Stride

R: Per/Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Opal (+1)

Teleports you or one you touch to any place within seven leagues either that you can see or that you have an arcane connection with. If you fail an Intelligence + Finesse stress roll of 9+, your arrival goes slightly awry. For instance, you might fall when you appear, or just be facing the wrong way. A botch means you appear in the wrong place, perhaps even in a wall.

Praefactus of Bonisagus’s version of this spell always allows him to appear in a safe, unembarrassing place (assuming he doesn’t fail his Finesse roll). All Praefactus’s spells make him seem as dignified as possible—manifesting his wizard’s sigil.

# Level 45

## The Walking Corpse

R: Reach, D: Perm, T: Ind, Ritual

Requisite: Mentem

Turns a corpse into a nearly mindless servant that can follow your simple verbal commands faithfully but unimaginatively. If the corpse still has most of its flesh, it becomes a zombie; if not, it becomes an

animated skeleton. Unless the corpse is preserved with Charm Against Putrefaction or the equivalent, the body decays normally.

# Herbam

Herbam spells work on plants and plant matter, both living and dead. Since wood is a common material in weapons, vehicles, and buildings, Herbam spells can be useful in improving or destroying physical things. They can also be used to bring the plant world to your aid.

# Creo Herbam Guidelines

These spells create and heal plants. Any food created is nutritious only if raw vis is used. The guideline levels given below are generally for conjuring the leafy parts of plants.

The basic range is Near, the basic duration is Sun, and the basic target is Individual. Plants may be created living or dead with equal ease. To create treated Herbam products (for example, wooden furniture, a vegetarian meal, linen or cotton cloth) add one magnitude to the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of unworked living or dead plants.

Level 5: Create a plant product (like a fruit or leaf). Create a plant. Prevent a plant from becoming sick.

Level 10: Create a bush or a pile of sticks or brambles. Prevent a bush from becoming sick.

Level 15: Create a tree. Create wood. Prevent a tree from becoming sick. Prevent wood from rotting.

# Creo Herbam Spells

## General

### Restoration of the Corrupted Plant

R: Near, D: Inst, T: Ind, Ritual

Cancels the effects of a malign Herbam spell that has its level matched or exceeded by the level of this ritual.
