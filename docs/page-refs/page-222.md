# The East and the Levant

## Latin Empires

The former Byzantine Empire has fallen along with its capital, Constantinople, which was sacked in 1204 by the lords of the Fourth Crusade. Its vast territory has been divided, with Henry of Flanders now the emperor of the new Latin territory of Romania.

Latin Greece has been divided up into the principality of Achaea, including the duchy of Athens, while the regions of Thrace and Thessaly now form the kingdom of Thessalonica. Western Greece, though, is still Byzantine, ruled by the despot of Epirus. Venice has control of most of the former Byzantine ports and of the island of Crete, as well as three-eighths of Constantinople itself.

## Constantinople

This once-great city is now languishing under the Latin conquerors, most of its treasures having been looted to adorn the buildings of Venice. Many buildings lie abandoned, but few people are willing to relocate there after the depredations of Baldwin (though Henry is proving to be a more humane ruler). It is still a center of commerce, however, and commands the straits between the Aegean Sea to the south and the Black Sea to the north.

## Nicaean Empire

Following the fall of Constantinople, the Byzantine emperor made Nicaea the seat of the now-reduced empire. After enduring attacks from both the Latins and the Seljuk Turks, he made an alliance with the Bulgars, diverting Latin attention to the north. This allowed him to triumph over the Seljuks and to stabilize his borders. He has been pursuing the Latins ever since, slowly whittling down their holdings in Asia Minor to a thin strip of the coast opposite Constantinople.

Nicaea is a crossroads city, and many strangers from far-off lands mingle in the streets: Saracen ambassadors, Asiatic warriors, Kievan traders, Latin knights, Genoese merchants, and others. As a result, Nicaea is a cosmopolitan center of culture and government in Asia Minor.

## The Levant (Holy Land)

The lands of the Levant are hilly and dry. Winds are mainly from the south and southeast, carrying little rain to this desert region; in the summer, the blazing sirocco is like a blast from a red-hot stove. There is little vegetation, and the primary crops are olives, cedar, and citrus fruits. This land is populated mostly by Muslims and Jews, although the number of Christians is growing.

## The Crusader Kingdoms

Formed by the lords of the First Crusade, these originally comprised four states: the kingdom of Jerusalem, the principality of Antioch, and the counties of Tripoli and Edessa. Edessa was retaken by the Saracens later in the series of crusades, and Jerusalem fell to Saladin in 1187, followed by Antioch. Antioch and some of the coast were recaptured in the Third Crusade, but Jerusalem remains under Muslim control.

## Jerusalem

This is the most holy city of Judaism and Christianity, as well as an important religious site for Islam. It is the site of the Holy Sepulcher, where the body of Christ lay for three days, and once housed the True Cross. The city is currently in Saracen hands, having been recaptured from the crusaders by Saladin after the Battle of Hattin. Most of the time, Muslims do not harm Christian pilgrims who come here to worship at the holy sites.

## Beyond Mythic Europe

The Greeks said the world is a sphere, and few doubt their wisdom. But what lies beyond the lands of Ethiopia and Russia, before the world comes round again upon itself, no one can say. The lands outside the European kingdoms are little known to the common folk, and their exotic nature has spawned all manner of outrageous tales.
