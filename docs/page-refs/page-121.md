rock. Through the Law of Sympathy, this helps destroy air within the area.

## Level 20

### Quiet the Raging Winds

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Bound

Spell Focus: A Branch of Ash (+1)

Stops all wind from blowing, leaving only calm air. This spell is not powerful enough to effect winds caused by Ritual magic. The branch of ash is said to provide protection from storms.

## Level 35

### The Cloudless Sky Returned

R: Per, D: Spec, T: Sight

Spell Focus: A Branch of Ash (+1)

This spell clears the sky within your vision of any clouds or other meteorological activity, either naturally occurring or caused by magic. The clouds take a few minutes to clear, during which time you must concentrate on them. This spell only affects meteorological activity in progress at the moment of casting, and is not powerful enough to dispel a weather condition caused by Ritual magic.

In Ferramentum's version of this spell, the clouds clear from the sky in an orderly manner, as if they were soldiers marching on parade.

## Rego Auram Guidelines

If you are affecting small amounts of air, the basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration and basic target is Individual. As with CrAu, targets often manifest as non-bounded areas. A Small effect in the absence of a container is about one half a pace across, an Individual effect is about one pace across, a Room effect (which can occur outside in this case) is about five paces across, a Structure effect (again, can occur outside) is about 20 paces across.

Controlling an amount of air with great strength or great precision raises the magnitude of the spell by one level.

Gen: Ward against Faerie creatures of the air whose Might is less than or equal to the level of the spell (duration Ring, target Group)

Level 5: Control an amount of air.

Level 10: Control an amount of air with great force.

Level 20: Direct weather in progress. Control an amount of air with enough force to uproot small trees.

Level 30: Cause clouds to produce rain. Control an amount of air with enough force to uproot large trees.

## Rego Auram Spells

### General

### Ward Against Faeries of the Air

R: Near, D: Ring, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

As Ward Against Faeries of the Water (ReAq Gen), but for faeries of the air. The Faerie cannot directly or indirectly break the magic circle, nor can they use ranged attacks or magic to affect those within it. From some angles at night, the ring may be seen as a violet-hued dome.

## Level 4

### Wind at the Back

R: Per/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Hand Fan (+1)

A breeze follows you until you stop traveling for more than ten minutes. It causes phenomena you pass through (fog, haze) to follow you.

## Level 15

### Broom of the Winds

R: Near/Far, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Splinter from a Broom (+1)

Whips up violent, swirling winds around the target. The target must make a Size stress roll of 9+ to remain standing. If the target is braced or holding onto some support, he may also make a Strength stress roll of 9+. If both rolls fail, the target is knocked in a random direction. The target may be damaged, depending on whether he strikes anything.

### Circling Winds of Protection

R: Per/Touch, D: Spec/Sun, T: Room

Spell Focus: Bottled Breath of a Zephyr (+5)

Surrounds you with winds that circle at great speed. Since the wind picks up dust and other small, loose objects, you may be obscured. Anyone standing near enough to attack you with a hand weapon must make a Size stress roll of 9+ at the beginning of each round or be blown back. Melee Attack rolls against you are at -3, and missile or thrown attacks are at -9. The wind blows while you concentrate, and then continues for five rounds after you stop. The zephyr's breath is released to encourage winds to blow faster.

## Level 20

### Wings of the Soaring Wind

R: Per, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Feather from a Bird of Legendary Size (+3)
