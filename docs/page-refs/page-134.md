# Level 25

## Lord of the Trees

R: Reach/Far, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Bark from a Century-Old Tree (+3)

Causes a tree to move its branches and bend its trunk in any way you mentally direct. A large tree striking with branches has Initiative +5, Attack +7, and Damage +10. Normal weapons are practically useless against large trees.

## The Treacherous Spear

R: Near/Sight, D: Spec, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Drop of Blood (+3)

The drop of blood that may be used with this spell must be from a person who has betrayed his or her family. The spell animates a wooden or wooden-hafted melee weapon in someone else's hand, and makes that weapon attack its holder until the wielder is dead or the weapon is destroyed. When the spell is cast, the weapon tries to break its wielder's hold (Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 9+ to hang on). On subsequent rounds, the wielder hangs on by making Strength stress rolls of 6+, allowed once per round. If a roll to hold on ever botches, the wielder loses control of the weapon and is hit by it automatically (see below). While still in its wielder's grip, the weapon does not strike him or her, but does not strike on the wielder's behalf either. Once the weapon breaks free or is released, it attacks its wielder, using his Attack and Damage scores.

The former wielder may fight the rebellious weapon. The weapon uses its defense rating as its Defense total. It has a number of "Body levels" equal to its Space characteristic. One handed weapons have a +6 Soak, and two handed weapons have a +10 Soak. All thrusting and missile weapons used against the controlled weapon suffer –6 on Attack Totals. The spell ends when the weapon loses all Body levels, or when an hour has passed, whichever comes first Causing the weapon to lose its Body levels may not destroy it, depending on the quality of the weapon.

# Level 30

## Freeing the Striding Tree

R: Reach/Far, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Violet Amethyst (+1)

Like Lord of the Trees, above, but the tree can walk half as fast as a human can. If you botch a Concentration roll to maintain control, the tree attacks you, having been awakened and disturbed by this spell. The violet amethyst aids this spell because it is the stone of Jupiter and thus aids in the command of others.

# Ignem Spells

As fire is volatile and dangerous, so are these spells. Magi who pursue the Art of fire do so with fine regard for the dangers and powers involved, for fire is both dangerous and mighty, to friend and foe alike. Storyguides should make Ignem botches particularly deadly.

Light and heat also fall within the domain of this Form. It's important to remember that heat also includes relative absence of heat, so spells that result in cold temperatures are possible through Ignem.

The standard targets correspond to different sizes of fires. Candles, torches, and small campfires are Small targets, large campfires and bonfires are Individual-sized targets, and house fires are Structure sized targets. Unless specified otherwise, a spell that can affect one type of fire can affect smaller fires as well. Fire damage is explained on p. 180.

# Creo Ignem Guidelines

Spells that create fires are versatile weapons—destructive to living things, undead, buildings, and morale. Those who depend on fire spells, however, risk botching. Fire is an unforgiving element for those who lose control of it, and self incineration is always a possibility.

Typical sigils seen in Creo Ignem spells involve the flame being a specific color or shape, or giving off an unusual smell.

The basic range is Near, the basic duration is Momentary, boosted duration is usually Permanent, and the basic target is Small.

Level 1: Ignite something extremely flammable (like oil or a wick). Illuminate an area as if by moonlight. Heat an object so that it is warm to the touch.

Level 3: Ignite something very flammable (like parchment). Illuminate an area as if by candlelight. Heat an object to be hot to the touch.

Level 5: Create a fire intense enough to do +5 damage (a Small flame can only affect a single target). Ignite something flammable (like dry wood or charcoal). Illuminate an area as if by torchlight. Heat an object enough to boil water.

Level 10: Create a fire doing +5 damage in an unnatural shape (like a ring or sheet). Create a fire doing +10 damage. Ignite something slightly flammable (like damp wood or leather). Illuminate an area as if by daylight on a cloudy day. Heat an object enough to make it glow red-hot.
