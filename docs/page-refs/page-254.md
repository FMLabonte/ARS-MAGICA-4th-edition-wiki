ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# Infernal Creatures

Devils are fallen angels, imprisoned in Hell until the end of time. They cannot leave the Inferno themselves, but their souls can rise to the terrestrial sphere when summoned by foolhardy wizards. In this state they are called demons, evil spirits that walk the Earth.

This dichotomy is somewhat simplistic, since Hell is also home to some infernal creatures that do not possess souls. You might want to refer to the Ars Magica supplement The Maleficium for more information.

# Demonic Strategies

Whatever their exact nature, demons exist in Mythic Europe, and they seek to bring about the downfall of humanity. When they cannot get people to worship them, or to stop worshipping God, they use other methods. Demons especially love destruction; however, this doesn't serve the long-term interests of the Prince of Darkness, as it usually sends people running to the protection of the Church. The soul is the prize; the body alone is as useless to the Devil as it is to his divine counterpart.

Violence is an effective strategy against wizards, though, especially Hermetic magi who are protected from many infernal powers by their Parmae Magicae. Magi are able to harm demons with their spells and are unlikely to turn to the Dominion, which interferes with magic. Thus, demons tend to bring their more overt powers to bear in confrontations with them.

Demons also employ possession, entering the victim's body and taking it over partially or completely and making the person commit "evil" acts. This does not taint the victim's soul, regardless of what the neighbors think. A soul can only be corrupted through a human's free will. Therefore, possession is a less desirable form of attack as well. Demons use more subtle approaches to seek human damnation.

Demons primarily use temptation: some moral dilemma is presented to an individual, who must make a choice with no arm-twisting. In making the wrong decision, the mortal taints his or her soul.

Oppression is a more broad-based attack, provoking emotions that are sinful in nature. The demon creates a general mood that affects large groups of people, by bringing about evil and unnatural events that affect the environment. The oppressive atmosphere sours moods and brutalizes emotions, encouraging people to respond with evil acts and damn themselves. Those who can see the world from a spiritual perspective are immune to this effect.

Obsession is a direct supernatural attack on a victim, brought about by the demon's presence. Obsession is distinct from possession, in that the demon never enters the human body but instead heightens inherent flaws. The basic form of obsession is the phantasm, an evil idea or image that flashes across the mind, usually arising from the victim's own darker wishes. A person who cannot resist these urges taints his or her soul.

Harder to produce and harder to resist is the psychomachia (pseu-ko-mah-KEE-ah, "battle for the soul"): the demon speaks to its victim, in his or her own voice, urging the commission of evil acts. In game terms, any Personality Trait roll is modified by the demon's Psychomachia score, prompting the character to behave sinfully or self-indulgently. The storyguide can also demand a Personality Trait roll from the victim at any time, even when roleplaying and the situation at hand otherwise make it unnecessary.

# Demons and Raw Vis

When their corruptive power touches the Earth, demons often leave behind physical residue in the form of raw vis. Animál, Ignem, Imáginem and Perdo vis are most common. If a demon has no obvious affinity with one of these Arts, it usually deposits Vim vis. Demonic vis is frequently tainted with evil, and can cause unpleasant side effects if used in magic. At the very least, double the number of botch rolls usually required.

When a demon is defeated or destroyed on Earth, its spirit is banished back to Hell. Often it cannot return to Earth for some time, as punishment for failed machinations; failure can also be punished by infernal torture. Because of this, it is exceedingly difficult to recover the corpse of a devil. Such a deed requires a journey to Hell, not lightly undertaken despite the prodigious vis harvest that can reward success.

Some devils are so weak that their spirits only come to Earth in physical form. The corpses of such demons can be harvested for vis. If this is the case, the amount and type of vis available will be set out in the creature description. In most cases, though, the devil's essence persists even if the physical manifestation is destroyed.

Demons and devils are completely immune to fire; spells that detect or force the truth; and spells that make them behave in a kind, compassionate, or virtuous manner.
