CHAPTER II

CHARACTERS

When it comes time to select Virtues and Flaws, each grog must be given one of the Virtues or Flaws from the Grog Background section of the Virtues and Flaws section.

## Archer

You are a custos. Your traveling companions look to you for backup and expect you to be vigilant for surprise attacks when they are locked in combat. When the turb goes into action you are often positioned at the rear to shoot at the enemy. You can also be called upon to kill a target, like the leader of a group of bandits, before melee commences. If your eye fails you, you commit your friends to a battle in which they lack the advantage.

Archer Abilities: Awareness, Climb, Stealth, one or more Weapon Classes (including Bows).

## Beggar

You came to the covenant intending to beg from its inhabitants. Living outside its walls with some of your associates, you soon found you could slip into the covenant to steal what you wanted. Before long one of the magi came out and invited you to stay and pay for what you had taken. What choice did you have? Now you live with the turb, but still find it difficult to do an honest day's work. You've perfected the art of looking busy.

Beggar Abilities: Area Lore, Awareness, Folk Ken, Guile, Stealth, one or more Weapon Classes.
