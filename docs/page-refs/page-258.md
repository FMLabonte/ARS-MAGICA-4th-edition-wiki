ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

he and his brothers go on their occasional raids into human villages. When such opportunities do not present themselves, he enjoys playing at drunken parties. Hybacus is not as skilled a warrior as his fellows, but they appreciate the music he provides. His piping inspires wild emotions in those who hear them.

Adventure Seed: The characters find Hybacus and his rowdy fellows having a party in the woods and are asked to join in. If the characters refuse or are otherwise rude (to satyr sensibilities), they risk being attacked. If they participate in the drinking, wrestling, bragging, and singing, the characters can make some good, if unpredictable, friends.

## Gizzle, a Goblin of the Mine

Gizzle and his fellow goblins haunt a mine near the characters' covenant. He looks like a four-foot-tall, misshapen man with mottled gray skin. He wears crudely woven clothes (but no shoes), and carries a miner's pick with a bronze head. His boisterous laughter can be heard throughout miles of tunnels. Sometimes he amuses himself by causing cave-ins or stealing miners' equipment that he finds lying about, and when in a vile mood he might attack a miner directly.

Adventure Seed: Gizzle and several other goblins have taken over a valuable section of the mine, killing several miners in the process. The characters must act decisively to win the trust of the remaining miners and to keep the mine operating at full potential.

## Divine Creatures

Divine creatures are very rare, but often have beneficial powers that make them highly sought after, either for help or for blessing. Their unearthly beauty is matched by tremendous ferocity when confronted by enemies of the divine.

## Alsatia, a Divine Unicorn

Immortal, graceful, and extremely beautiful, Alsatia is one of only a small number of divine unicorns, magical creatures that have received God's grace. They vigorously defend any woman, maiden or no, and relentlessly hunt down rapists and molesters. Alsatia travels Mythic Europe in search of evil, finding and destroying it wherever she can. To anyone with infernal ties she appears dreadful—a shimmering white flame curls off her horn and her eyes glow intensely red.

Adventure Seed: A rapist fleeing the wrath of Alsatia insinuates himself into the covenant. A grog patrol is con
