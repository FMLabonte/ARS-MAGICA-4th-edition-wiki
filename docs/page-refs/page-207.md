Repair determines how well kept up your buildings are. Good repair means that there are no major problems, and minor ones are fixed within a day or so. Excellent repair means that everything is as good as new (unless the basic quality is poor, in which case there will still be problems). Poor repair means that even quality roofs leak, that the plumbing does not work, or that the hypocaust belches smoke into the living areas. If a building in poor repair is also of poor quality, sections of walls are patched with sacking and propped up with beams of wood, and areas of floor are almost rotted through.

One positive point can put two points of size in good repair, or one in excellent. Negative points mean the things are falling down. Each negative point indicates that about 10 pounds of silver must be spent on repairs each year, or one point of Size will be lost. (Note that you lose 1 size point no matter how many negative you take here—it just costs more to avoid the loss).

> Example: The members of Voluntas do not seem the sort to be obsessed with repair, and Julia is more likely to go on to new projects than look after old ones, so David decides to spend no points here, taking average repair.

> Thus, overall one positive point has been spent on buildings, giving a score of +1.

## Defenses

### Site

The covenant's site affects its defensibility to a great extent. Positive points here buy easily defended sites like the top of a hill, an island in a river, or a peninsula. As a rough rule of thumb, consider there to be four ways of approaching a covenant. 1 point will make one approach a bit difficult (heavy brush, soft ground, or a gentle upward slope), 2 will make it difficult (a rock field, marsh, or moderate slope), 3 will make it very hard (a steep slope or river), and 4 will make it all but impossible (a cliff or chasm).

Negative points buy defensive weaknesses. Again, consider four directions. 1 point puts cover in one direction (a forest), 2 makes it overlook the covenant (a cliff), and 3 makes it dangerous (a waterfall which could be diverted into the covenant). A covenant on a mountain which can only be approached along one track would spend 15 points here: 4 points for three sides, and 3 points for the side with the track. A covenant at the base of a mountain, with a river running past it on one side, would pay 3 positive points for the side with the river, and 2 negative points for the overlooking mountain behind it.

> Example: Voluntas is built on the moors, which are mostly flat heathland. David could justify spending one point on each direction of approach to represent difficult, soft, ground, but decides not to, at this stage.

### Extent

The living quarters previously purchased include basic defenses—either stone walls and thick doors on every building, or a basic wall around them. One negative point will leave one point of space completely undefended. One positive point will make one point of space well defended (arrow slits and battlements, or an elaborate wall). Concentric walls are very expensive: they cost a number of points equal to the size within, plus the cost of any elaborate defensive structures built on them.

One positive point buys an elaborate defensive structure (like a gatehouse or watch tower). A basic covenant gets one for free, which may be bought off with a negative point. Elaborate defensive structures may be built into other defenses, like a gatehouse, or be separate, like a watchtower or gate blocking a river. A stone wall is a basic defense. If the wall has battlements and a parapet for the guards, then the defense is elaborate.

> Example: Voluntas has a stone wall, but there is no description of the defenses of the rest of the covenant, other than mention of two towers. David decides that these both count as elaborate defensive structures and spends a positive point to account for the second one. He decides that the rest of the buildings have basic defenses, and so spends no more points.

### Repair

Repair for defensive structures is the same as repair for buildings. Note that defenses in poor repair may be easy to breach, since the wall may be weakened, or the portcullises non-functional.

> Example: Average repair seems most appropriate, and so David spends no points here.

> Overall, then, Voluntas has Defenses +1.
