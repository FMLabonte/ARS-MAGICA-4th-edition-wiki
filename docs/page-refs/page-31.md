# Characteristics

There are eight Characteristics in Ars Magica, each representing one of a given character's inborn attributes. Each Characteristic has a score that describes the degree of the character's aptitude. A score of 0 is completely average, therefore positive numbers denote higher-than-average ability and negative numbers below-average ability. All but the most exceptional of individuals have Characteristics that fall between -3 and +3.

Since Characteristics represent your character's inborn potential, they cannot be increased by normal means. In rare circumstances, the storyguide may decide that drastic events warrant some sort of permanent change to a Characteristic.

Characteristics are often grouped into pairs for convenience. When this is done, Intelligence is grouped with Perception, Strength with Stamina, Presence with Communication, and Dexterity with Quickness.

# Characteristic Descriptions

## Intelligence (Int)

Intelligence represents both memory and the capacity to learn and think. It is important for Abilities that require thought power and is paramount for the Hermetic Arts. A character with low Intelligence is not necessarily stupid—common sense, street savvy, and wisdom are not described by Intelligence.

## Perception (Per)

Perception quantifies the ability to notice things, as well as powers of intuition. While sometimes conscious, Perception often works intuitively—your character simply notices something. The storyguide may also let you roll Perception when checking various Knowledges, to see if you have insight into a certain fact or concept. Perception is important for Abilities such as Awareness, Hunt, and Folk Ken.

## Strength (Str)

Strength measures physical power: lifting, pushing, shoving, heaving and moving. Strength is important when hefting a melee weapon and when using brute, physical force against something or someone. People with high Strength are often bigger than those with low Strength, assuming they have the same Size.

## Stamina (Sta)

Stamina represents the limits of a character's exertion, as well as how much physical punishment he can sustain. It is staying power, both mental and physical, and one of its most important components is simply the will to live. Stamina also measures someone's ability to carry a load for an extended period, ignore fatigue, and withstand wounds.

## Presence (Pre)

Presence describes a character's appearance, demeanor and charisma. It is important for making a good impression, as well as for leading people. Presence also measures how imposing or intimidating a person is. Even if not physically attractive, a person with high Presence might still have a demeanor that commands respect.

## Communication (Com)

Communication represents the aptitude for self-expression. It is important when attempting to influence or communicate with someone, verbally or otherwise. A positive Communication score suggests a character who is comfortable with or confident in his relationships with other people.

## Dexterity (Dex)

Dexterity means being able to move with agility and to manipulate objects accurately and skillfully. It includes hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, and bodily grace. Dexterity also helps determine how well your character swings a sword or throws a knife.

## Quickness (Qik)

Quickness indicates reaction speed and reflexes, and helps determine who acts first when two people are trying to do something with great haste. It also describes how well your character does something in a hurry. Your effective Quickness is usually modified by your Encumbrance. See page 63 for more information on Encumbrance.
