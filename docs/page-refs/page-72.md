with the word “Aimed,” followed by the targeting modifier for that spell.

The die rolled for targeting depends on the situation. If something bad could result from failing to cast the spell or if the situation is otherwise stressful, roll a stress die. If there's no pressure, roll a simple die. Add the roll, your Perception, and your Finesse together. If this meets or exceeds an ease factor set by the storyguide (using the table on page 71), your targeting is successful and the spell takes its full effect. If you miss your intended target, your spell takes effect behind or to the side of the target, failing to affect it. Of course, the spell still goes off, so it may affect others and have various side effects. The storyguide should determine exactly what happens when a targeting roll fails. The results of a botched targeting roll can be horrible—rather than affect the intended target, you might hit a friend, yourself, or something you're trying to protect. Again, the storyguide has full control over the effects.

## Arcane Connections

Some spells, in accordance with the Law of Arcane Connections, require an arcane connection to cast. An arcane connection is some item that is intimate to the target of the spell. It might be an actual piece of the target, such as a stone from a cobbled street, clippings from a horse's mane, or the hair of a person. Or, it might be some important supernatural piece of equipment, such as a magus' talisman.

Exactly what is and what is not an arcane connection is up to storyguide interpretation in some cases. For example, a magus may be able to establish an arcane connection to a little girl through her doll, if she is exceptionally emotionally tied to it.

Note that there is spell range called “arcane connection.” An arcane connection (that is, a physical item) is always required to cast spells of this range. Sometimes spells of other ranges will also require an arcane connection. Even then, those spells retain their original range.

## Resisting Hostile Magic

There are two kinds of protection from magic: natural resistance and magic resistance. Natural resistance is a defense inherent to the target of a spell. It derives from the target's essence, functions automatically and constantly, and is completely nonmagical. Most people and creatures have only natural resistance, and since most spells are unaffected by natural resistance, normal people fall easily to them. If a spell can be defended against with natural resistance, that spell's description outlines how the natural resistance works. For instance, *Trust of Childlike Faith* (page 147) can be resisted by an Intelligence roll. Natural resistance rolls are always made on a stress die. In general, a successful natural resistance roll prevents a spell from having any effect on you.

Magic resistance can come from a variety of sources—from innate magical nature, from holy (or unholy) blessings, from the Hermetic Parma Magica (see “Parma Magica” on page 73) or from knowledge of a Hermetic Form. Magic resistance can be cumulative with natural resistance, and can often stop a spell or effect before it even hits its target.

If your natural and magical resistance fails, you may still be able to protect yourself with a quick counterspell. See “Fast-Cast Spells” on page 75 for more information on this option.

## Spells That Can Be Magically Resisted

Whether you can use magic resistance against a given spell depends on how it affects you. All spells that attack you directly, or attack you by magically forming a medium (like a lightning bolt), can be resisted. The incidental effects of spells that affect you by changing your environment cannot be resisted. Most illusions cannot be magically resisted, because they exist in your environment and don't affect you directly.

Intéllego spells can be resisted but not always countered. If an Intéllego spell gives the caster a vision of the target without probing the target's person in some way, the target's successful resistance lets him know that he is the subject of some type of detection magic. He does not know what specific spell was cast or who cast it. Spells like *Eye of the Sage* (page 124) work like this. On the other hand, Intéllego spells that probe the target's person or anything else protected by the target's magic resistance, such as spells that read minds or attempt to determine if the target's possessions are magical, are blocked when resisted.

## Magic Resistance

When a spell that can be resisted strikes a character with magic resistance, the target must roll a stress die to see if the spell is resisted. There are a number of modifiers to this roll.

- Might: This is a statistic that describes creatures and other non-human powers. For instance, a faerie with a Faerie Might of 22 has a 22 Magic Resistance.
