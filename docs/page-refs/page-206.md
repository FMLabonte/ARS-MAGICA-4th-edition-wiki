ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

have poor access and good seclusion, while an invisible castle by a main road might have good scores in both.

Travelers will generally be looking for shelter, and will have legitimate reasons for their journeys, often trading or pilgrimage. If there is nothing obviously magical about the covenant, they will probably not cause trouble. A covenant with poor seclusion would therefore be well served by making an effort to appear normal. Seclusion also covers the difficulty that mundane authorities have in finding you if they want to make trouble.

**Example:** Voluntas's location comes in useful for seclusion. No one would have much reason for traveling the Moors, other than being lost or looking for the covenant. David decides that getting lost is relatively common in the Middle Ages, and so someone turns up every couple of months, or eight weeks. That costs 3 positive points.

## Environment

An average environment provides no benefit or penalty. Better than average environments might have especially good air, while below average ones are unhealthy areas like swamps. Environment can be purchased by buying bonuses and penalties to aging rolls at double the pyramid cost of the bonus or penalty (so for example, buying a +3 bonus costs 12 points).

Environment is also the catch-all category for unusual features of the site, such as a magical spring with water that makes people drunk or magical flowers that bloom all winter. The storyguide should assign costs as he feels appropriate.

**Example:** The Moors are a bit boggy in places, but probably not enough to make the environment unhealthy. There were no magical features in the initial concept, so he leaves it at that, spending no points on Environment.

Voluntas thus has four negative and three positive points in site, for a total of one negative point, and a score of -1.

## Buildings

## Size

An average covenant has enough living space for 6 magi, 20 specialists, and 50 grogs. This is about the same size as a medium-sized monastery or a very large manor. Each negative point removes space for 2 magi, 20 specialists, or 50 grogs. Each positive point adds the same amount.

Covenants can also have impressive structures: great halls, council chambers, impressive libraries, and the like. Each impressive structure costs 1 point. An average covenant gets one for free, which may be removed by spending one negative point. If there is no impressive structure, there are still mundane rooms for necessary functions. Impressive structures may be part of the main structure, such as a great hall built into a manor, or separate, such a freestanding church or chapel. Many medieval buildings are constructed around a courtyard, with the various ranges (sides of the court) dedicated to specific functions, such as servants' quarters or storage.

**Example:** Voluntas was described as a large manor, so average size seems about right. There are only five magi resident, but David decides that there is space for another. He hesitates over the impressive structure, since Julia has not built her council chamber, but decides that the library qualifies. Thus, no points are spent here.

## Quality

One positive point will make two points of space good quality, or one point excellent quality. (One point of space is that for 2 magi, 20 specialists, 50 grogs, or 1 impressive structure.) Quality includes artistic quality, good design for living (not just looking at), and durability of materials. Good quality might mean tiled roofs, glazed windows, and stone walls. Excellent quality might include carved buttresses, stained glass, internal bathrooms, or even plumbing and hypocaust heating.

One negative point will make two points of space poor quality, or one point dreadful quality. Poor quality might mean poorly designed roofs which catch water and rot the thatch, wattle and daub rather than wood and plaster for walls, or even poorly executed attempts at decoration. Dreadful quality means that the roof lets in rain no matter how well repaired it is, the wind can get through the walls, and the windows are unglazed and cannot even be shuttered.

**Example:** Although the quality of Voluntas is not covered in the initial concept, David decides that Julia will not have put up with shoddy work, so it is all at least average. Further, he feels that she would have pushed for some better areas, and decides that the library, Julia's quarters, and the quarters of one other magus are of good quality. That costs 1 positive point.
