# Using Abilities

An Ability score modifies a die roll when a character attempts an action that it governs. Generally you will add your character's score in the appropriate Ability to your score in one Characteristic to the roll of a die. Often times, other modifiers will also apply based on the specific circumstances of the action. The Characteristic chosen depends on how the Ability is used. For example, Athletics is usually used in combination with either Stamina, Dexterity, or Quickness. In a situation where your character is attempting to leap over a chasm, you would apply your Athletics score and your Dexterity score. On the other hand, when running a foot race, you would sum your Athletics and Quickness.

The Storyguide determines the ease of success in given tasks by assigning ease factors. When using an Ability against a static force the ease factor is based on the difficulty of the task. For example, when attempting to pick a lock, the ease factor would be based on the quality of the lock. When the attempt is opposed by another person's actions both roll and compare results. The higher total usually wins, but the storyguide must take into account any other modifiers that apply, such as Encumbrance, Virtues and Flaws, or special circumstances.

The storyguide decides whether the roll is a stress or simple die. If your character is feeling pressured and is likely to make mistakes or do exceptionally well as a result, the roll is stress. The storyguide can also set a minimum Ability score that must be met even to attempt certain rolls.

You may not always be aware of the reasons for rolling, the modifiers to your rolls, or the results of success or failure. In situations where your character does not know what is going on, the storyguide may simply roll on your behalf and announce the results.

If your character attempts an action covered by an Ability that he does not have, there are three possible procedures. For Talents (except Exceptional Talents—see page 59), roll a stress die modified only by the appropriate Characteristic, with three additional botch dice if you roll a 0. For Skills, you receive a -3 penalty to your stress roll as well as three extra botch rolls. Where the action requires a Knowledge, you cannot even make the attempt. (When the action in question is governed by a Casual Knowledge, the storyguide might give your character a chance to recognize something that is commonly known.)

# Choosing Abilities

You purchase your character's initial allotment of Abilities with starting experience points representing the amount of learning and practical knowledge your character has picked up so far in his life. Companions and grogs start with a number of experience points equal to twice their age. They may purchase Abilities as they see fit, though if you are using a vocation template, a list of suggestions is provided.

Starting experience points for magi are determined by their house affiliation—see the "Conceptualization" section on pages 21-26 for the exact total for any given magus character. If you are creating a magus, your house template includes a list of starting Abilities. These have already been paid for—simply record them as they are written. As mentioned above, your template also includes a number of experiences points that you may spend at your discretion, either
