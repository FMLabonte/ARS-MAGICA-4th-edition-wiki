CHARACTERS

quent work to be had at the covenant you may live there, relying on the magi for protection against the law (you have to do some entrepreneurial work, after all). When magi go abroad you often accompany them to acquire information—and the occasional trinket.

Bandit Abilities: Area Lore, Athletics, Awareness, Climb, Guile, Pick Locks, Stealth, one or more Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

## Courtier

You are educated, trained in social skills, and of high enough rank to do as you wish. Courtly life occupies your time, but bores you. Out of curiosity and a desire for adventure, you associate with the covenant. However, you try to keep that association secret, for it could mean social alienation back at court.

Courtier Abilities: Artes Liberales, Civil &amp; Canon Law, Etiquette, Guile, Intrigue, Noble Lore, Ride, Scribe Latin, Speak Latin.

You patrol the forests of a lord or even of the monarch, or maybe you protect lands deeded to a covenant's magi. You are your own keeper, though you must be ever vigilant—if you don't protect the reserved game, you could lose your hand in place of a poacher's. You are of value to the covenant because you know the lands you patrol, and can help magi find things they seek there. In return the covenant offers companionship, for most commoners shy away from you to avoid recognition.

Forester Abilities: Animal Handling, Area Lore, Athletics, Awareness, Hunt, Stealth, Survival, one or more Weapon Classes (including Brawl).

## Hermit

You once belonged to society, but ostracized yourself or were exiled, maybe for religious reasons. You've learned much about the world and the supernatural in your lonely life.

The magi listen to what you have to say and treat you with respect since their lives are also devoted to solitary contemplation. Though you may not live in the covenant, you're not far away.

Hermit Abilities: Area Lore, Chirurgy, Legend Lore, Survival.

## Knight

You are a warrior with a vow to serve a noble, and in turn your monarch. Alternatively, you may pay homage to a church, magus, covenant, or the Order of Hermes itself;
