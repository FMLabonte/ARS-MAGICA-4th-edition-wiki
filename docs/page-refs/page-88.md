# Using Invested Devices

Several rules apply to all invested devices, unless an effect modification has been made, and specifically states otherwise.

- If your effect is based on a spell that has two ranges or durations listed for it, the shorter is used for each.
- When you use a magic effect against someone or something with Magic Resistance, you have to make a magic Penetration roll, as you do with a spell. It is the power of the effect itself that attempts to penetrate, though, not your own power. The device's Penetration score equals the starting level of the effect (the level of the spell being duplicated, not modified by frequency of use or other factors).
- Unless otherwise specified, an effect that duplicates a spell requiring concentration to maintain also must be concentrated on to be maintained.
- All Targeting rolls demanded by a device's effects are made by the wielder of the device, using the wielder's Finesse score.
- If a person gains possession of your magical device and knows the triggering actions of its effects, that person may utilize the device. Even if the possessor does not know the triggering action, he may investigate your item in the lab to learn its effects.
- You can use one effect from one item each round, using the appropriate trigger action for each. You must make any Targeting or magic Penetration rolls that are necessary, but do not roll for Fatigue.
- If the enchanted device is broken, all its powers are lost.
- You may use an enchanted item before it is "filled up" with effects and still add effects later.

# Lesser Enchanted Devices

Invested devices, because of their great power, take a great deal of time and vis to create. Lesser enchanted devices are a more limited, but less expensive type of magical device.

To create a lesser enchanted device, choose the shape and material of the item as for an invested device, but you need not take a season to prepare the item for enchantment. You merely perform a limited preparation on the device and instill a single effect in it, both within the same season. No initial Vim vis is spent to "open" the item to enchantment.

The amount of vis you may instill in the device, and thus the level of the power you may instill, is limited both

by the material and size of the item (as per the Material and Size table) and also to your Magic Theory + Vim score.

You must design the effect you are instilling just as carefully as you do when instilling an effect in an invested device. Indeed, all the modifiers for invested devices apply here. If your Lab Total is twice the level of the effect (after all modifications), you enchant the effect into the item. If not, the effect is beyond your ability to instill in this limited manner; you must prepare and enchant the item as an invested device, or choose a power that is more within your capabilities (both of which are projects for another season). If you attempt to instill a power and fail, your vis is wasted.

After a single season, your work is complete. You may never instill any other powers into the item, even if the material and size of the item allow for more. A lesser enchanted device may never be used as a talisman.

# Charms Against Magic

Even though there is no spell to do so, magi can invent magic devices (invested or lesser enchanted) to protect the bearer against magic. The effect uses the Arts Rego and Vim, and the level of the effect is equal to the Magic Resistance it provides. The charm works continually on the bearer of the device (though Constant Use must still be chosen for the effect frequency). The effect works like the Parma Magica, but is incompatible with Parma Magica or any other type of magic resistance. Thus, the bearer may not add his score in a Form to the charm's Magic Resistance. If the bearer has a Magic Resistance of his own, the higher of the two protections, that of the bearer or that of the charm, overrules the other.

# Potions

A potion is a specialized, single-use type of enchantment that affects whatever it is applied to. Manufacturing potions is relatively easy, requiring you to alchemically combine, refine, and distill the magical essence of mundane ingredients. Creating potions requires no vis, and you can often brew several doses of a potion in a single season.

Making a potion involves fully describing an effect, as you do when inventing a spell, and concerns your Lab Total and magic aura. The potion only affects whatever it is applied to, so some spells cannot be duplicated by potions. For instance, an Unseen Arm potion is not possible. A potion can never give anyone the ability to cast a spell, nor is it possible to simulate a ritual spell with a potion.
