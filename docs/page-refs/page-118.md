tight. Rose of Jerbiton's version of this spell always causes the air to smell of roses.

## Level 10

### Jupiter's Resounding Blow

R: Far, D: Mom, T: Group

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Violet Amethyst (+5)

Creates a thunderclap; anyone directly underneath must make a Stamina stress roll of 9+ or be deafened. If deafened, the target gets another Stamina simple roll each minute and recovers with a roll of 9+. If the first roll botches, the victim is rendered deaf for a month. Violet amethyst is the stone of Jupiter.

### Stench of the Twenty Corpses

R: Near/Sight D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Piece of a Rotting Corpse (+3)

Makes the surrounding air stink horribly of rotting corpses, until the odor dissipates naturally. All those within 10 paces of the target point must make Stamina stress rolls of 6+ or act with a -3 penalty on all rolls. Anyone who botches the roll vomits and is incapacitated for (10 - Stamina) rounds.

## Level 15

### Charge of the Angry Winds

R: Near, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: An Agate (+1)

A wall of wind roars away from you, starting up to 10 paces away and continuing up to 30 paces. The wind is 5 paces wide. All within the area must make a Dexterity + Size stress roll of 9+ or fall down and be blown along by the winds. The rolls must be made at the start of the gale and each subsequent round that the wind is maintained. You must concentrate on the gale, but you may only maintain it for a maximum of five rounds. Missile fire into or out of the gale is futile, and marching against the gale requires a Strength + Size stress roll of 15+. Failure in this attempt mandates another Dexterity + Size stress roll of 12+ to keep from falling.

### Wreaths of Foul Smoke

R: Far/Sight, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Dollop of Mud from a Marsh (+1)

Thick, yellow, sulfurous smoke rises up from the spot you designate, filling a circular area 9 paces across. It blocks sight, and for each round anyone breathes the smoke, a Stamina stress roll of 9+ must be made or a Fatigue level is lost. Once a character is Unconscious, further failed rolls result in the loss of Body levels. The smoke dissipates naturally; it may persist for less than a minute in the open, or it may hang in a closed room for hours. The area where the spell is cast will be damaged: small plants wilt and die, and tree growth is stunted. A faint stench of sulfur clings for days to anything exposed to the smoke.

## Level 25

### Clouds of Rain and Thunder

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Bound

Spell Focus: The Essence of an Air Elemental (+3)

Creates a severe rainstorm, including lightning and winds. It takes half an hour for the clouds to form and start raining, during which the magus must maintain concentration. The storm rages on for ten minutes after the caster ceases to concentrate on it, and calms down to nothing over the next twenty minutes.

### Clouds of Summer Snow

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Bound

Spell Focus: Ice Shavings (+3)

Creates clouds that drop snow out to the horizon. It takes half an hour for the clouds to form and start snowing, during which the caster must continue to concentrate on it. The snow stops ten minutes after the caster ceases to concentrate on it, and the clouds disperse over the next twenty minutes. The spell does not affect temperature.

## Level 35

### The Incantation of Lightning

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Spec

Aimed: -3

Spell Focus: An Oak Wand (see below) (+3)

A lightning bolt shoots forth from your outstretched hand in the direction you are pointing, doing +45 damage to a single target it hits. Those near the target must make Size stress rolls of 6+ to remain standing. The oak wand need not be magical, but must be from a tree struck three times by lightning.

## Level 40

### Breath of the Open Sky

R: Per, D: Spec, T: Spec, Ritual

You can call up a wind capable of devastating the countryside. You must stand under the open sky to cast this spell. Once you have completed the ritual, a breeze picks up in front of you. As long as you face in the same direction, the wind grows in speed and breadth. After a half an hour has passed, the wind is a gale roaring over the visible countryside and beyond, strong enough to topple wooden structures and knock down trees. If you turn away from your original facing for more than a few seconds, you have to make a Concentration roll of 12+ to maintain the spell. If you turn away for a minute or more, the spell ends.

## Level 60

### Wrath of Whirling Winds and Water

R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Spec, Ritual

The spell can only be cast at sea or at the coast, and creates an immense storm, 40 or more miles wide, of hurricane intensity. The storm takes three or four hours to form completely, and rages for at least a day, or longer of it is cast during time when storms are common
