CHAPTER II

CHARACTERS

Flaws a negative value, the size of the number indicating how much they affect your character. The only way to get Virtues is to take Flaws. Every Flaw you accept for your character has a negative point score, which you may balance with the equivalent number of points in Virtues. You may spend these points as you please, choosing several low-cost Virtues or a few with a high cost. Some Virtues and Flaws have variable costs, depending on the intensity of the effect.

Magi and companions may spend up to ten points on Virtues and ten points on Flaws. Grogs may spend up to three points on Virtues and three points on Flaws. The only restriction is that the total value of Virtues and Flaws for each character must be the same, in order to balance their effects. At the option of the storyguide, a character can be allowed to purchase more points worth of Flaws than Virtues, but in no case may the limit based on character type be exceeded.

Virtues and Flaws that are directly contradictory, or that deal with the same aspect of your character, are mutually exclusive—you may not buy both. Some Flaws are twisted forms of Virtues, in which case they also cancel one another out and are again not allowed. Virtues which provide bonuses on the same activity or statistic are not cumulative. The combination simply gives the bonus that the greatest gives alone. Consult the storyguide if you are unsure how two of your Virtues or Flaws might affect one another.

Sometimes you may take more than one Virtue or Flaw relating to a particular aspect of your character. This is perfectly allowable. Virtues and

Flaws that somehow work against one another can create an interesting inner struggle, such as Compulsion to drink, which can conflict with being Dutybound.

Virtues and Flaws are not gained after character generation. In some cases, characters might gain abilities or status that resembles Virtues or Flaws described here, but these should not be recorded as additional Virtues or Flaws. In no case must these new effects be balanced with other Virtues or Flaws. If your character gains the status of a noble (similar to some of the Companion Social Class Virtues) through game play, for example, you need not select a new Flaw to counterbalance this gain.

Virtues and Flaws are listed below, each with a short description of its effect, from the character's point of view.

Hermetic Virtues and Flaws (those available only to magi) are listed first. Magi are encouraged to use half of their total allotment for these Hermetic Virtues and Flaws, though they are not required to do so. Next are Companion Social Class Virtues and Flaws. These are only available to Companions, and each Companion must choose one (and only one). Next are Grog Status Virtues and Flaws. Again, each grog must choose one and only one of these.

Following the magi-, companion-, and grog-specific Virtues and Flaws is the general list of Virtues and Flaws, most of which are available to all characters. Some may have different values depending on the type of character they will apply to, while others are not available to certain character types.
