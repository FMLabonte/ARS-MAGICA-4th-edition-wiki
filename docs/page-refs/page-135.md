# Creo Ignem Spells

## Level 1

### Moonbeam

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Quartz (+5)

Causes a gentle light, bright enough to read by, to shine down from above and illuminate the area described by your encircled arms. Lasts as long as you hold your arms in a circle. Quartz is a rock associated with the moon.

## Level 5

### Palm of Flame

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Piece of Flint (+1)

A flame leaps up in your palm, which must be upturned for the spell's duration. The flame does +10 damage to anyone else that touches it.

## Level 10

### Heat of the Searing Forge

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Chrysolite (+3)

Heats a piece of metal so that it is too hot to touch. Something the size of a breastplate or helmet does +5 damage if in direct contact with the skin for one round. For each additional round, more damage is done, the amount dropping by two points each round (+3 damage on round two, then +1). Smaller objects do less damage. Most metal armor has leather or cloth underneath that gives the victim a +3 Soak bonus against the heat. Chrysolite is a rock having strong associations with the Sun.

### Lamp Without Flame

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room

Spell Focus: Lantern Oil (+1)

Illuminates the room that you are in with a light equal to torch or lamp light, as long as you concentrate. When using lantern oil, you spread it over some object, and the light emanates from that object. When cast outside, this spell illuminates an area about 5 paces across.

## Level 15

### Flash of the Scarlet Flames

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Small

Aimed: -3

Spell Focus: Flint (+1)

A brilliant red flash explodes in the air where you designate. If you target a person's face (which requires a targeting roll), the target needs a Stamina stress roll of 9+ to avoid temporary blindness. If the target botches the roll, he is permanently blinded. If temporarily blinded, he can try to make a simple Stamina roll of 9+ each minute to recover. The flash is equivalent to looking straight at the sun.

In Rose of Jerbiton's version of this spell, there is a faint odor of roses in the area where the flash explodes.

## Level 20

### Blade of the Virulent Flame

R: Reach/Near, D: Spec, T: Small

Spell Focus: The Blood of a Fire Drake (+3)

Forms a fire along the length of a metal blade. This flame doubles the weapon damage score for the blade (or adds +6, whichever is greater), and can start fires as well. After half an hour, the blade becomes so hot that it begins to melt. Once this occurs, the spell ends. The user of the flaming blade must wear gloves as the hilt gets hot, or else the sword cannot be handled. If using the spell focus, you spread the blood along the blade. The +3 focus modifier is also added to damage caused by the blade, because the fire is hotter and more intense.

### Pilum of Fire

R: Spec, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: +1

Spell Focus: A Javelin (+1)

A 2-foot, thick, spear-shaped jet of fire flies from your palms (consuming your spell focus, if you are using one), doing +25 damage. One point less is done for each pace of distance between you and your target. Beyond 25 paces, the flames dissipate.

## Level 25

### Arc of Fiery Ribbons

R: Spec, D: Mom, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Yellow Diamond (+1)

A dozen multi-hued ribbons of flame leap from your hands and fly out 15 paces, covering a 60-degree arc. All those in the arc take +20 damage, modified by 1 for every pace of distance between you and the target. The area affected by this spell is so broad that targeting rolls are only necessary in exceptional circumstances. Targets who sees the ribbons coming can fall flat and therefore suffer half damage. A Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 18 or better is required to do this, though a +1 bonus applies for every pace between the target and caster. If this escape roll botches, the target suffers an extra +5 damage. The yellow diamond has associations with the Sun.
