# Chapter VII Storyguide

The information in this chapter is not for the storyguide's eyes only, as the title "Storyguide" might suggest. The first section provides practical advice to both new and old storyguides on how to manage a game full of players, keeping them happy and entertained. The other sections consist of rules that the storyguide will need to adjudicate the game.

## Storytelling

Telling a great story is not easy, and nothing can be written here that will turn you into a teller of great tales overnight. Becoming a great storyteller requires nothing less than experience. That is not to say that nothing can be said to help you. With any luck, the advice presented here will place you squarely on the road to adventure, and enable you and your troupe to chart new realms of imagination.

There is advice in the Saga section on how to deal with mood, theme, plot, and the other elements of stories. This section will deal with the more practical aspects of storytelling.

## The Troupe

Ars Magica, as you know, is different from other role-playing games in that the storyguide often changes in the midst of a single saga. This presents a unique set of challenges. Who is in charge in between stories? Who adjudicates laboratory activities? Who oversees the activities of the storyguide's own characters when he is running the story? Who sets the overall story arc for the saga? There are several different ways that such questions can be answered.

The first strategy you can take is to adopt a more traditional roleplaying structure—that of one storyguide who makes all the decisions and controls no player characters. This keeps questions of who adjudicates what very simple. Unfortunately, in such cases, the storyguide misses out on the fun of creating and playing characters within someone else's framework. The players, in turn, have a limited capacity to create their own tales.

To alleviate this problem, you can change the set up slightly. The single storyguide from the previous structure becomes the alpha storyguide, who sets the main plot arcs for the saga. He adjudicates many stories and all in-between times activities like advancement and laboratory work (except when it involves his characters). Other troupe-members are allowed, under this model, to occasionally run a story, or perhaps a series of related stories.

Taking things one step further, the alpha storyguide can give up even more power over the troupe. This third strategy allows each troupe-member who so desires to make up an entire saga arc and become an important storyguide. This approach allows many people with many different ideas to all work together and have a large say in how the saga progresses. The alpha storyteller coordinates the different visions to make sure that everything makes sense. The drawback is that the troupe runs the risk of becoming lost in stories that point every which way, but benefit in that all troupe-members, even the alpha storyteller, can play in a variety of engaging stories.

Finally, the position of alpha storyguide can be all but abandoned. Although it is probably wise to have someone who is nominally in charge to make final arbitrations when that is necessary, each storyguide takes on as much as he
