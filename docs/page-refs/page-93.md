# Extraordinary Results Chart

|  Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
|  Botch | Disaster  |
|  0-3 | Complete failure  |
|  4-5 | No benefit  |
|  6-7 | No extraordinary effects  |
|  8 | Side effect  |
|  9 | Special or story event  |
|  10 | Discovery  |
|  11 | Modified effect  |
|  12+ | Roll twice more on this chart.  |

**Disaster**: You fail miserably. Roll a simple die + risk modifier – Perception, and compare to the following chart.

|  Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
|  0 or less | You spot the disaster before it occurs. Your season is still wasted; see Complete Failure.  |
|  1-2 | Your creation is destroyed.  |
|  3-4 | Your creation is destroyed, and so is some other valuable item that you keep in your laboratory.  |
|  5-6 | Explosion! You lab equipment is ruined, and you must roll a simple die for each valuable possession you keep in your lab. On a 0, it is destroyed. You take an amount of damage equal to a simple die + the level of the spell or effect you were working on.  |
|  7-8 | Your experiment backfires in such a way that the entire convenant is threatened, either through fire, the summoning of a major threat, or some other calamity the storyguide makes up.  |
|  9-10 | You enter Wizard's Twilight. Add the magnitude of the spell or power you were working with to the local aura to determine the strength of the supernatural power you must control.  |
|  11+ | Roll twice more on this chart.  |

**Complete Failure**: You get nothing from your efforts, and your season is wasted. If you were working on a familiar or enchanted item, roll a simple die. On a 0, it is destroyed.

**No Benefit**: Your experimentation produces no results. You lose the benefit of the extra die and risk modifier—recalculate your Lab Total without those modifiers. If your new Lab Total is to low to succeed in the project, it must be abandoned.

**No Extraordinary Effects**: Your experiment works without producing any unintended effects.

**Side Effect**: Your magical creation acquires a side effect. Roll a simple die, and work out the specifics with the storyguide.

|  Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
|  1 | Your sigil is exaggerated to many times its normal strength, becoming a significant portion of the effect.  |
|  2-3 | The effect has a minor flaw. For example, a spell that allows you to communicate with animals causes you to retain some of the animal's speech patterns for a time after the spell ends.  |
|  4-5 | The spell has a minor side effect. For example, a spell that controls an animal causes grass to grow under its feet.  |
|  6 | The spell has a minor side benefit. For example, a wind spell has a pleasant smell and makes flying insects uncomfortable.  |
|  7 | The spell has a major flaw. For example, a healing spell causes its targets great pain.  |
|  8 | The spell has a major side effect. For example, a plant control spell attracts all birds in 100 paces.  |
|  9 | The spell has a major side benefit. For example, a spell that transforms you into a wolf also lets you speak to all beasts while a wolf.  |
|  10 | The spell has a fatal flaw. For example, an invisibility spell makes you glow.  |

**Special or Story Event**: Either some effect not covered elsewhere occurs, or, at the storyguide's option, an event unfolds as a result of your work which involves the entire covenant.

**Discovery**: Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier.

|  Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
|  1-4 | You gain three experience points in Magic Theory.  |
|  5-6 | You gain three experience points in some Arcane Ability or Mental Skill related to the experiment.  |
|  7-8 | You gain three experience points in one of the Arts used in the experiment.  |
|  9 | You gain enough experience points to bring one of the Arts used in the experiment to the next level (or three experience points, whichever is greater).  |
|  10+ | Roll twice, and reroll this result if it is generated again.  |

**Modified Effect**: Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier. If you were investigating a magic item, you have changed one or more of its powers.

|  Roll | Result  |
| --- | --- |
|  1-3 | The spell or effects is reduced in range, duration, target, or potency.  |
|  4-6 | The spell or effect's range, duration, target, or potency is increased.  |
|  7-8 | The use of the spell or effect is restricted. For example, it fails to work in certain circumstances, like when it is raining.  |
|  9-10 | The actual effect of your experiment is modified. For example, a spell like *Curse of Circe* (page 125) turns the target into a goat instead of a pig.  |
|  11+ | The actual effect of your experiment is changed completely, save that the relevant Technique and Form remain unchanged, and the level remains similar.  |
