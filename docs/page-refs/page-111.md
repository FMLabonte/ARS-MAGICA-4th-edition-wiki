CHAPTER V
SPELLS
111

# The Falcon's Hood

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Falcon's Hood (+1)

Destroys an animal's vision. The title refers to the hood used to cover a falcon's eyes when it is not hunting. If such a hood is used with the spell, the casting is made more effective.

When cast by Asaron of Flambeau, this spell causes the animals it targets to bear a faint silhouette of a flame in their eyes.

# Level 30

## The Hunter's Lethal Arrow

R: Spec, D: Spec, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Destroying Angel (+3)

Requisite: Herbam

Enchants an arrow to slay an animal. To use the spell focus Destroying Angel, which is a poisonous mushroom found only in faerie forests, you rub the arrow with the pulp from the mushroom. The arrow must be fired in the round after the spell is cast; otherwise, the spell dissipates. If the arrow hits an animal, the beast must make a Stamina + Size stress roll of 12+. If the animal fails, it falls to the ground and convulses for several minutes before finally expiring. If the animal makes the roll, it still suffers normal arrow damage + 10. The target gets a normal magic resistance roll.

# Rego Animal Guidelines

Basic range is Eye, basic duration is Concentration, basic target is Individual.

You may further refer to Corpus for ideas and guidelines on controlling an animal's body, and Rego Mentem spells for ideas and guidelines on controlling an animal's mind.

Sigils typical in Rego Animal spells are those that cause beasts to act in certain ways.

**General:** Protect a group from attacks by magical creatures of Might less than the level of the spell (duration Ring, target Group).

**Level 4:** Manipulate items made from animal products.

**Level 5:** Plant a single suggestion in the mind of an animal. Protect the target from animal attacks (affects normal animals only).

**Level 10:** Calm an animal.

**Level 15:** Manipulate an animal's emotions. Paralyze an animal.

**Level 20:** Make an animal completely passive.

**Level 25:** Completely control an animal.

# Rego Animal Spells

## General

### Ward Against the Beasts of Legend

R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Group

Spell Focus: A Star Ruby (+3)

No magical beast whose Magic Might is equal to or less than the level can affect the targeted Group as long as they remain within the ring. When a magus is making this and most other wards, a common gesture employed is the Fig Sign. The magus balls his or her right hand into a fist, placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers. A magus traveling to Italy should be warned that this sign is a deadly insult in that country. The star ruby is a very powerful and rare gem that aids in controlling some types of entities.

## Level 5

### Disguise of the Putrid Aroma

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Corked Bottle (+1)

The target takes no interest in you as long as you continue to concentrate, and do not threaten it. A carnivore treats you as if you were simply something it does not eat. It retains normal interest, however, in anyone else nearby. A corked bottle is representative of you and your contained odor.

### Soothe the Ferocious Boar

R: Eye/Near, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Piece of Red Mullet (+3)

Calms an animal until it is threatened or aroused again. You must speak soothingly or musically to it. Red mullet is a fish known for its capacity to calm those who consume it, though the animal need not eat it.

## Level 15

### Panic of the Elephant's Mouse

R: Eye/Near, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mouse (+2)

Makes an animal afraid of the target by preying upon its instinctive fears, causing it to attempt escape by the quickest, most feasible means possible. The animal may make a Size stress roll of 9+ to resist. The title refers to the elephant's legendary fear of mice, and the mouse, being capable of engendering that fear, serves as focus to engender fear in all animals, through the Law of Sympathy.

### Viper's Gaze

R: Eye/Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Two Seized Bones (+3)

Holds an animal rigid as long as you maintain eye contact with it and concentrate on it (assuming no vis is used). The seized bones are "sympathetic" to those in the animal's body.
