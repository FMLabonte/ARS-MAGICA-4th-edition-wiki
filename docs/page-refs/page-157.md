# Muto Vim Guidelines

These spells let you change other spells. The basic range is Reach, the basic duration is Special (these spells are not well described by the standard durations), and the basic target is Individual. Most Muto Vim spells last as long as the spell that they have altered.

These meta-magical spells have certain special restrictions, which apply to all Muto Vim spells invented according to Hermetic theory. First of all, they cannot be cast on spontaneous spells. Such magic is being manipulated at whim—any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control.

Secondly, when you cast a MuVi spell, you get double the normal botch dice. Magi who have mastered the spell roll the normal number. Even if the spell is mastered, you must roll a stress die. The same applies to the spell that you are casting on, even if it is being cast by another magus, and even if it is mastered. If either spell botches, both do.

Thirdly, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+ if you are casting both spells (that is, the MuVi spell and the spell it is affecting). If this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch. You don't have to double botch dice on it, though.

If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus, you must either be co-operating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell spontaneously. There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition, your Penetration total for the Muto Vim spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are co-operating.

These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depend on a good understanding of the processes involved.

You may only put a Muto Vim effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All Muto Vim spells require some tailoring to the specific use, hence the additional botch dice, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored.

Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way: it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants. See the example spells for ideas on how specific this should be.

Gen: Superficially change a spell of less than twice the level of the Vim spell. This may not change the primary effect of the spell, or its power.

Gen: Significantly change a spell of less than the level of the Vim spell. This may not change either the Technique or Form of the target spell. A change in power of plus or minus one magnitude is a significant change, as is a change of target, if the target was possible for the original spell.

Gen: Totally change a spell of less than half the level of the Vim spell. This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts. The Vim spell affects the structure of the spell, not the things that the spell targets. A change in power of up to two magnitudes is a total change. Any greater change requires either Creo or Perdo to create more magical energy or destroy some.

# Muto Vim Spells

## General

### Mirror of Opposition (Form)

R: Reach, D: Spec, T: Ind

Cast on another spell while the other spell is being cast, this causes the targeted spell to have the exact opposite of its normal effects. This effect works on spells up to half the level of the Mirror of Opposition spell. The effects of the inversion are up to the storyguide to determine, but the target of the inverted spell usually remains the same as that of the original spell. The inverted spell cannot overcome any limitations of Hermetic magic. For example, if an Instant Perdo Corpus spell is cast, the inversion is probably a Creo Corpus spell of Sun duration. There are ten versions of this spell, each affecting spells of one of the Hermetic forms.

### Shroud Magic

R: Reach/Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

This spell allows a magus to suppress or alter the sigil in a spell that is currently being cast, or which has been cast and is still active. The spell to be shrouded can be up to double the Shroud's level.

### The Sorcerer's Fork

R: Reach, D: Spec, T: Ind

This spell splits another spell (whose level must be less than the level of this spell) into two or more identical spells of reduced power, which may be cast against two or more separate targets. Each resulting spell has the same range, duration, and target (target category, that is—the actual target may be different) as the original spell, but the power of the effect is divided by the number of resulting split spells. The precise effect is at storyguide discretion. One penetration die is rolled, and the penetration total is split between the spells. The Sorcerer's Fork must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell that is to be split. The split spell has a targeting penalty as for multiple casting (see page 75). If the casting magus is not co-operating, all the split spells will strike the original target.

### Wizard's Boost (Form)

R: Reach, D: Spec, T: Ind

You cast this spell as another spell of a level less than this one is cast. The effect of the other spell increases 5 levels in power, but not past the level of the Wizard's Boost. The effects of the extra 5 levels of power are for the storyguide to determine. A Wizard's Boost may never affect a single spell more than once. There are ten versions of this spell, one for each Hermetic Form. There are other versions of this spell, each of which affects one of range, duration, and target, for any Form. Storyguides may find this spell unbalancing, and may disallow it at their option.

### Wizard's Communion

R: Reach/Near, D: Spec, T: Group

This spell lets magi combine their power to cast spells. The group of magi work together to cast a specified spell through the unified power of the Communion. Only one extra magus may join the Communion for each 5 levels of the specified spell being cast. One of the magi in the group must also know the specified spell, or must cast it from a text.
