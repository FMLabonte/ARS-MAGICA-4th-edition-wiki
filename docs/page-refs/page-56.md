ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Carouse: The ability to enjoy oneself without suffering adverse effects. A person with this skill can, for example, consume prodigious amounts of alcohol without passing out. The skill also covers a familiarity with acceptable behavior, balancing enjoyment and moderation. With this Skill, a person is able to have fun and gain friends among the lower classes nearly anywhere, even among those of a different culture. Specialties: power drinking, drinking songs, games of chance, staying sober. (Stamina, Communication)

Etiquette: You know the social graces and how to behave in different situations. Successful Etiquette rolls might also grant you bonuses on rolls for Social Talents or other Social Skills. Specialties: nobility, court, peasants, faeries, the Church. (Presence, Communication)

Intrigue: Dealing and plotting, including subtle use of power in non-confrontational ways to achieve your own ends. Intrigue need not be underhanded or manipulative—it also cover negotiations and knowledge of formal and informal rules of conduct and politeness. In addition, Intrigue also allows a character to pick up important information about those in power, separating fact from useless gossip. Intrigue is a vital talent for those who frequent court or a Hermetic tribunal. Specialties: gossip, plotting, rumormongering, alliances. (Presence, Communication, Perception)

Leadership: Getting people to obey your orders and to follow you. Can also be used to inspire fear in others, cowing them into submission. Specialties: magi, mercenaries, bandits, armies, intimidation, grogs. (Presence)

## WILDERNESS SKILLS

## WORK SKILLS

Chirurgy (kie-RUHR-gee): This is Middle Ages-style surgery, used to help others recover from physical damage. It encompasses tending and binding wounds of all varieties, and the necessary but brutal skill of cauterization. Specialties: cauterization, diagnosis, binding wounds, setting bones. (Intelligence, Dexterity)

Craft (Type): A general term for countless Skills, all dealing with handiwork of some type. Some sample crafts: baking, blacksmith, bowmaking, carpentry, chandlery, clothiery, cooperage, embalming, engineering, fishing, glassworking, goldsmith, hideworking, jewelworking, leathercraft, locksmith, masonry, milling, perfumery, portraiture, pottery, sculpting, shipbuilding, silversmith, smelting, weaponry, winemaking, woodworking. You may purchase Craft more than once, choosing a different one each time. Skill in one Craft does not imply skill in any others. Feel free to make up your own Craft if it does not appear in this list. Specialties: as appropriate to the craft. (Intelligence, Dexterity)

Wagoneering: Handling carts and wagons of all kinds, vital for trade and most farming. Specialties: speed, repair, rough terrain. (Dexterity)

## Knowledges

Knowledges are Abilities that require application of the mind rather than the body, so they almost always use Intelligence as a modifier. Many activities that 20th-century people take for granted, such as counting and reading, are not common among medieval folk.

You usually use stress rolls for Knowledges, even when your character is not under pressure. This simulates variable recollection: while someone with limited knowledge is unlikely to have picked up little-known facts, a very knowledgeable person might still miss a few bits of information.

Knowledges can be increased through direct experience, training, or study.

## ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGES

Academic Knowledges require formal university training. Beginning characters may only purchase Academic Knowledges if they are magi or are specifically permitted through the purchase of a Virtue. In addition, learning an Academic Knowledges requires a Speak Latin score of at least 3, as all of them are taught in Latin.
