CHAPTER V
SPELLS
141

# Level 25

## Summoning the Distant Image

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Rock Crystal (+1)

You can see and hear what is happening in a distant place if you have some sort of arcane connection to either the location or a person there. If your viewing area is outside, you can only see and hear for a distance of about five paces. Outside that range the images and sounds get hazy.

# Muto Imáginem Guidelines

These are useful and powerful illusion spells, altering the visual image, noises, smell, or taste of some object or being. The image remains altered without your concentration and adapts itself appropriately to the medium. The accuracy of duplication depends on your knowledge of the subject. For instance, if you want to make a voice like that of a specific person, you must be familiar with the voice that you want to mimic. Those more familiar with the face, voice, body, or other aspect being mimicked might see through an illusion by mundane means (“Duke Tybol, isn’t your scar on your left cheek?”).

The base range is Near, the base duration is Sun, and the base target is Individual.

Level 4: Heighten or lessen one sensation of an object (for example, make a candy more sweet or less sweet).

Level 5: Change one sensation of an object (for example, make a leaf look like a coin), but not its type.

Level 10: Change two sensations of an object.

Level 15: Change three sensations of an object.

Level 20: Change four sensations of an object.

Level 25: Change an object completely, in all things except touch.

Level 30: Completely distort the sensory perceptions of a target.

# Muto Imáginem Spells

## General

### Restore the Image Transformed

R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Room

Spell Focus: An Icon (+3)

Restores to normal an image that has been transformed with a Muto Imáginem spell, if you can match the target spell’s level on a stress die + level of your spell. If you are using a spell focus, the icon must represent the image that you are trying to restore.

# Level 4

## Taste of the Spices and Herbs

R: Reach/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Small

Spell Focus: Spices (+3)

A setting’s worth of food or drink tastes and smells exactly as you designate.

# Level 5

## Notes of a Delightful Sound

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Musical Triangle (+3)

Causes all sounds in a room, particularly music, to be especially clear and sonorous. The notes are clearer, sharper, and more distinct. Add +1 to Communication rolls and +6 to music-related Ability rolls.

# Level 10

## Aura of Ennobled Presence

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Violet Amethyst (+5)

The target appears more forceful, authoritative, and believable. Numerous subtle changes in appearance bring about this change, including a slight supernatural illumination of the face, a more erect posture, and a louder and smoother voice. The target’s Presence increases by +1, or rises to 0, whichever produces the higher result. The character gets a +3 on rolls to influence, lead, or convince others.

# Level 15

## Disguise of the Transformed Image

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: An Icon (+3)

Makes someone look, sound, and smell different, though at least passably human. The icon must resemble the changed appearance of the person.

# Level 25

## Image Phantom

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Cocoon (+1)

Any one thing, including a living thing, can be made to appear as if it were something else of approximately the same shape and size. The illusion cannot be cast on things that have a shape or size improper to the final appearance, and is broken if anyone, including the target, takes an action that suggests it is something other than what it seems to be. For instance, a person has to curl up to be made to look like a rock; the person’s standing up or being touched shows the illusion to be false and ends the spell.

# Level 30

## Visions of the Infernal Terrors

R: Near/Sight, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Hand of Glory (+3)

Requisite: Mentem

Causes everything the target sees to look and sound terrifying. The world looks basically the same, save that everything is hideously transformed somehow. The target must roll a stress die, adding his
