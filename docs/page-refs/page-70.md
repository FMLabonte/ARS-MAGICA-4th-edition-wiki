THE ART OF MAGIC

- They cannot affect an area larger than you can see (though the effects may move out of your sight and control once a spell is cast).
- Their duration cannot be longer than one month.
- They cannot be used to perceive anything in the past or future.

Ritual spells can surpass these limits, creating farther-reaching and longer-lasting effects. Formulaic spells may only surpass the limits on duration and range, and only through the use of raw vis. Spontaneous spells cannot exceed any of these limits, and the effects of ritual spells cannot be produced at all with spontaneous magic.

To attempt to cast a ritual spell, you must spend 15 minutes in uninterrupted concentration for every 5 levels of the ritual spell. You must also spend 1 pawn of raw vis (see "Using Raw Vis" on page 77) for every 5 levels of the spell or fraction thereof. That vis must match either the Technique or Form used in the spell.

To determine your success, make a casting roll as you do for formulaic spells, adding your Concentration if you have that Ability. Because ritual spells are both physically and mentally demanding, fatigue loss is greater for ritual spells than formulaic or spontaneous spells. If your spellcasting roll is greater than the level of the spell, it works and you lose a Fatigue level. If your spellcasting roll is between the spell's level minus 10 and the spell's level the spells succeeds and you lose two Fatigue levels. If you miss the spell's level by more than 10 the spell fails, you lose two Fatigue levels, and all the vis used is wasted. If you drop below "Unconscious" due to fatigue loss, you are unconscious for an extra hour. If your ritual spell succeeds, remember your roll, as it may be required to determine whether the spell penetrates an opponent's Magic Resistance (see "Magic Resistance" on page 72).

Many ritual spells have two ranges or durations listed. For each level of either range or duration that you wish to extend, you must spend an additional 15 minutes and one additional pawn of vis per 5 levels of the spell. Thus, if you wish to extend both the range and duration to the second (longer) shown, you have to spend 45 minutes and three pawns of vis per 5 levels of the ritual spell.
