## Winter's Icy Touch

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Garnet (+5)

Causes the target to feel a chill and lose body heat. A Stamina stress roll of 9+ is required, or a Fatigue level is lost. If used, the garnet is crushed during the casting of the spell. Garnets provide protection against illness, so destroying one sympathetically helps the spell.

## Level 20

### Conjuration of the Indubitable Cold

R: Reach/Far, D: Mom, T: Room

Spell Focus: A Garnet (+3)

Cools the air in the targeted room (or within 10 paces of the target outside), leaving it a little below freezing. All nonliving things are chilled thoroughly, not just on the surface. All living things (except you, if you cast with a Rego requisite) lose one Fatigue level and must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ to avoid losing a second. House fires become as small as campfires, bonfires become as small as torch fires, and campfires and smaller fires go out.

## Level 30

### Well Without Light

R: Reach/Far, D: Ring/Perm, T: Circle

Spell Focus: Black Onyx (+1)

Removes light from the target area. Only spells greater than level 25 can create light within this area. When casting this spell, magi typically clench a hand into a fist, possibly grasping a black onyx, and the light flows into the fist like a living entity, until the entire area is dark. The black onyx is a stone commonly associated with darkness and death.

## Level 35

### Wizard's Eclipse

R: Sight, D: Diam, T: Bound, Ritual

The sun is eclipsed within the target area, making it as dark as night. The darkness begins very suddenly—the superstitious are likely to panic, especially if they see that there is normal daylight just beyond the boundary of the spell.

## Rego Ignem Guidelines

Basic range is Reach, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small.

The intensity of a fire also affects the difficulty of controlling it. Add a fire's (damage bonus – 5) to the level of a spell to control a fire.

Level 5: Control a fire in a natural fashion (for example, control its direction of spread).

Level 10: Control a fire in a slightly unnatural fashion (for example, stop it from burning a person).

Level 20: Control a fire in a very unnatural fashion (for example, fashion into a dancing humanoid shape).

## Rego Ignem Spells

## Level 5

### Tremulous Vault of the Torch's Flame

R: Reach/Near, D: Mom T: Small

Aimed: 0

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+5)

Causes a torch fire to quiver a few seconds and then make a leap of up to 10 feet in any direction. A targeting roll is required to hit a specific target. The flame stays at the spot it hits if it can burn there (see rules for fire damage on page 180). Otherwise, it simply scorches the spot and goes out (doing +5 damage).

## Level 10

### Light Shaft of the Night

R: Far/Sight, D: Conc, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Quartz (+5)

Collects moonbeams and starlight into a single vertical shaft of soft, silvery light that moves under your control. It illuminates an area 15 paces across with light nearly equal to sunlight (if the moon is out) or moonlight (if the moon is not out). If the sky is overcast, the spell does not work. Can only be cast under the night sky.

## Level 20

### Leap of the Fire

R: Near/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Aimed: +2

Spell Focus: A Cat's-Eye Gem (+3)

Causes a bonfire to make a leap of up to 10 paces in any direction, where it catches if there is fuel, or burns out if there is none. Make Targeting roll to hit a target; the flames do +10 damage.

## Level 25

### Burst of the Sweeping Flames

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+3)

This spell causes a fire to explode outwards from its source along the ground, as if a giant wind were blowing on it from above. The fire travels for no more than 10 paces, but it ferociously ignites anything in its path. The original fire is left dead, but in all probability a number of new fires will be started. The flames cause +5 to +20 damage, depending on the size of the original fire.
