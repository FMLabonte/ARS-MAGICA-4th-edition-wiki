ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Starts a plague in a city or other Boundary. The plague reaches its height in six to twelve months and can spread like any other plague. It is non-magical once begun, and health measures can lessen the effect of the plague. A full-blown plague kills one in ten inhabitants of a city over the course of a few months. Using, or even transcribing, this spell is rigorously discouraged by most of the Order of Hermes.

## Rego Corpus Guidelines

Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.

Level 5: Make a target lose control of a body part.

Level 15: Control the large-scale physical movements of a target.

Level 20: Hold a target's the body motionless.

Level 25: Control a target's motions. Eliminate the penalties of fatigue and wounds.

## Rego Corpus Spells

### Level 5

#### Curse of the Unruly Tongue

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+3)

Causes the target to stutter and slur words. Communication rolls are at -3. Spoken spells are at -6 to the spellcasting roll, and there is an extra botch die.

#### Spasms of the Uncontrolled Hand

R: Far/Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Branch of Holly (+3)

The target must make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or drop anything held in the target hand.

#### Rise of the Feathery Body

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Feather of an Eagle (+3)

Allows the target to float vertically to any height, carrying up to 50 pounds, and rising as fast as smoke rises, slower if carrying a heavy load. The target cannot move horizontally through this spell.

### Level 10

#### Gift of the Frog's Legs

R: Touch/Near, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Legs of a Frog (+1)

Allows the target to leap up to 15 feet vertically or 25 feet horizontally (2 feet less for every Encumbrance point). The person must make a Dexterity – Encumbrance stress roll of 6+ to land without injury. A miss indicates the loss of one Body level, and a botch indicates a broken ankle or other crippling injury. The target can only leap once for each casting of the spell, and that leap must be made within ten seconds. As with a frog's leap, a running start does not improve the leap.

### Level 15

#### Despair of the Quivering Manacles

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mannequin of the Target (+5)

Your target shakes vigorously from side to side without falling. Those affected get -3 on rolls requiring physical movement, and -1 to most other rolls.

#### Endurance of the Berserkers

R: Touch/Near, D: Conc/Sun, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Lock of Hair from a Berserker (+3)

The target's body acts as though it were unwounded and unfatigued for as long as you concentrate (or until sunrise or sunset if vis is used to increase duration). Keep track of the actual Body and Fatigue levels that the body loses while "berserk," because as soon as the spell wears off, the target loses those levels. If the target runs out of Body levels at any time during the spell, the spell terminates immediately and the character dies. If the target runs out of Fatigue levels, the spell terminates immediately and the character falls unconscious.

Consecutive castings on a character delay the end of the spell—that is, put off the time when accumulated wounds take effect—but a body can only take a number of consecutive castings equal to its Size + 2. Further castings have no effect.

#### Lifting the Dangling Puppet

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Mannequin of the Target (+3)

Lifts a person of Size +1 or less vertically into the air. Generally, you can make the target rise or descend as fast as smoke rises, but a heavier person rises more slowly and falls more quickly.

### Level 20

#### The Gift of Vigor

R: Touch/Near, D: Mom, T: Spec

Spell Focus: A Ruby (+3)

Transfers bodily energy from you to any target who is at a lower Fatigue level than you. You are thus at the target's current Fatigue level, and he or she assumes your previous level. If you lose a Fatigue level from casting this spell, the loss comes after the transfer. Magi have long looked for a way to restore their energy in order to cast more spells. This is the closest they've come. The ruby is associated with Mars, representing vigor and strength.
