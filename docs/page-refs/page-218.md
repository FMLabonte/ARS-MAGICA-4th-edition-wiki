ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

Barcelona is the leading city of Catalonia. Situated on the eastern coast, it carries on great trade with the Italian merchant cities and all over the Mediterranean. Barcelona is home to many Jews, who are accepted as citizens but dwell in their own separate quarter of the city.

## Castile

Across the western part of the peninsula, along the border with Portugal, is the kingdom of Castile. This land is a bitter enemy of the Moors and the most proudly Christian kingdom in Iberia, second perhaps only to Portugal in devotion. Castile has contempt for Aragon and its tolerance for Jews and Moors. It may be only the Muslims themselves, who still hold southern Spain, that keep the two kingdoms from going to war.

## Navarre

This small Spanish kingdom on the northern coast is constrained on the west by Castile, on the east by the Pyrenees mountains, and on the south by Aragon. Because its location is relatively unimportant to trade and military pursuits, Navarre is a poor nation. Its king is more interested in French affairs and English dealings in Aquitaine than in the Reconquista to the south.

## Portugal

Portugal hugs the west coast of Iberia, and is in excellent position to control trade through the Strait of Gibraltar. Lisbon, the capital, was captured in 1147 from the Moors by King Alfonso I, with the help of English and German crusaders; it provides a fine natural harbor at the mouth of the Tagus River. The city is protected on land by miles of walls and at sea by valiant Portuguese sailors. In the south, the Knights of Aviz guard the border, and may be considering forays south against the Moorish city of Silves.

## Muslim Spain

The Moorish holdings in Spain formerly constituted the Caliphate of Cordoba, but this collapsed in the early 11th century, leaving a collection of small Muslim kingdoms called *tai'fas*. This area is now occupied by the Almohads of North Africa. Its great city, on the southern coast, is Granada of the Thousand Wonders. More riches and marvels are to be found here than anywhere else, with a Palace of Ambassadors whose apartments are fitted in the style of every land.

The cities of Moorish Spain hold great schools and libraries where Christians, Moors, and Jews alike teach and learn. There are gardens said to be magical miniatures of each country and clime, and a menagerie of creatures from the ends of the earth. As well, there is an island reserved solely for the use of falconers; legends tell of griffins trained there for the hunt.

## France

France of the 13th century is not a unified country. In Brittany, a rocky land jutting out into the Atlantic, you can still hear the Breton language passed down from the ancient Gauls. Along the English Channel is Normandy, home to the ancestors of the king of England. South of Normandy are the lands of the count of Anjou. To the east is Blois, ruled by the Count of Champagne, then the Île de France, the personal domain of the king. There, astride the River Seine, lies Paris, which many consider to be the greatest city in all the West. Champagne lies north and east of the king's lands, and Burgundy south and east. Both are ruled by counts rich with the wealth brought by their vineyards.

Southern France, called Occitania or the Languedoc, has its own distinct language (Provençal) and culture. It has as many ties of language, culture, and feudal obligations with Aragon and Catalonia as it does with the rest of France. This is the land of troubadours, the inventors of courtly love; it is also home to the Cathar heresy. Provençal culture no longer flourishes as it did in the last century, for the land is oppressed by war: a crusade called against the Cathars and the nobles who gave them shelter. Knights and armies from the north of France have laid waste to the land, sacking towns and putting their inhabitants to the sword. The crusaders are inspired by the promise of salvation for this service to the Church, and the hope to become the new masters of this land. The Count of Toulouse, Amaury de Montfort, is now a northerner; his late father Simon was granted the title and lands by the pope for launching the crusade. Some say the crusade has gone too far, but the bloodletting continues.

The king of France, Philip Augustus, claims to be liege over all of these lands, and spends much of his time fighting wars to back up that claim. He has been quite successful; at the turn of the 13th century he secured the territories of Anjou, Normandy, Touraine, Maine and Poitou from King John of England, shattering the patrimony built by the iron fist of Henry II. Aquitaine remains an English fief. Philip stands to gain handsomely from the crusade in the south, as his subjects are the majority of the crusaders. The old king of Aragon was killed coming to aid of his Provençal vassals
