ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# Level 30

## Steed of Vengeance

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: The Hoof of a Pooka (+5)

Turns a horse into a ferocious magical mount. Its coat becomes a deep black and its eyes a fiery red, its teeth transform into fangs, its hooves become razor-sharp, and it occasionally breathes steam from its mouth—the horse seems a creature from Hell itself. All Attack and Damage rolls get a +5 bonus. The horse tolerates a magus rider. When the spell wears off, the horse must make a Stamina stress roll of 9+ or die from shock. Pookas are shape-shifting hobgoblins that enjoy playing tricks on mortals. They may be found in faerie forests.

## Transformation of the Ravenous Beast to the Torpid Toad

R: Near/Far, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Toadstone (+3)

Turns any animal into a toad, unless it makes a Size stress roll of 9+. Birds are so dissimilar to toads that they get a +3 bonus to their roll. The toadstone that may be used with this spell is a rock that is either shaped like or colored like a toad. You can tell if you have a real toadstone by placing it in front of a toad. If the toad tries to leap forward and grab the rock, you have a genuine toadstone. A newly created toad will hold a certain terror for peasants and serfs, because many believe toads exude a poisonous substance from their skin.

# Perdo Animal Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Instant, basic target is Individual. There is normally no Soak against Perdo Animal—the magic does not create something that causes damage, it just causes damage. Magic resistance is the only way to withstand it.

Perdo Animal spells are very dangerous, because they will harm a beast for the rest of its natural life. A common sigil among Flambeau magi, and others who cast Perdo spells, is to leave some type of mark with the damage they do.

When inventing new spells, you may wish to consult Perdo Corpus for guidelines and ideas.

Level 3: Damage something made of animal products.

Level 5: Do superficial damage to a beast (for example, remove its hair). Destroy something made of animal products.

Level 10: Cause a beast pain, but do no real damage.

Level 15: Do 1 Body level of damage. Destroy a beast's limb.

Level 20: Destroy one of a beast's senses. Do 2 Body levels of damage.

Level 25: Do 4 Body levels of damage.

Level 35: Kill an animal.

# Perdo Animal Spells

## Level 5

### Agony of the Beast

R: Sight/Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Branch of Holly (+3)

After you point at the beast and cast this spell, it begins lashing wildly about, upsetting any nearby objects, and howling in great pain. In order to do anything else, the beast must make a Stamina + Size stress roll of 9+ each round.

Holly, believed by many to be a harmful plant, may be used in this spell to inflict pain. Note that a magus noticed with a twig of it, and with other obviously wizardily apparatus, may find villagers mistrust him or her and may blame him or her for any local problems.

### Alleviate the Serpent's Bite

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Spec

Spell Focus: Branch of Ash (+3)

Destroys one dose of animal toxin. The spell can render poison in a poisonous animal inert. If cast on a toxin already in someone's body, the spell requires a Corpus requisite and keeps the person from suffering further damage. In order for the spell to affect herbal or mineral poisons, an appropriate requisite is needed. Ash, which is the spell focus, is commonly known by folk to provide protection from both snakes and poison.

## Level 10

### Decay Fur and Hide

R: Far, D: Mom, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Bit of Animal Fur (+3)

Destroys an object made of animal fur or hide, including wool and leather. Each casting decreases leather armor's Protection value by 3 points—any armor dropped to 0 Protection is destroyed completely. When the spell is cast with a spell focus, you destroy the bit of fur by some normal, physical means, which strengthens the spell through the Law of Sympathy.

Marius of Tremere invented this spell with an Auram requisite, which causes the target to disappear in an impressive puff of smoke. When using the spell focus, he burns it at casting time.

## Level 20

### Cripple the Howling Wolf

R: Reach/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Leg Bone of a Wolf or Dog (+3)

When casting this spell, you commonly make an abrupt snapping motion with your hands, snapping the leg bone if you have the spell focus present. If the beast fails to make a Stamina + Size stress roll of 12+, its leg is cleanly broken. At this point, the beast falls to the ground and dies from shock if it fails a Stamina + Size stress roll of 3+. Even if the roll succeeds, the animal loses a Body level. Because the duration is Instant, the bone will never heal by itself.
