ARS MAGICA

THE ART OF MAGIC

The feast of St. Antony, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, and Ailred of blessed memory.

I am still alive, and I have a friend here. Jocelin is a minstrel, and not much older than me. He lives here all winter, and for much of the rest of the year, but he also travels round England. He assures me that I will be allowed to leave.

He came to me on the day after I arrived, and offered to show me around the place. This is the covenant Voluntas, part of the Order of Hermes. The magi, those whom I saw at the council, rule the covenant, while the consortes like Jocelin see to day to day administration and the turb does all the menial work. The magi all have private areas, which Jocelin refused to show me: he said it was too dangerous. Julia of Jerbiton, my mistress, is the most approachable of them. Kirist of Flambeau, the one in red, has a nasty temper, and can make you burn by snapping his fingers. Phessallia of Merinita, the woman in white, is cruel and cold, and I should stay away from her. Corvus the Raven of Bjornaer is just wrapped up in his own world, and doesn't like interruptions. Desiderius of Verditius is a necromancer, and would be more interested in me were I dead. I asked Jocelin where all these places — Jerbiton, Flambeau, and the rest — were, and he laughed, saying that they were not places, although they were houses. He said that Julia would explain that to me, and that he did not fully understand it.

Jocelin took me to the kitchens, and introduced me to the head cook. She warned me about stealing from the

larder, and told me that I was not a magus yet. He showed me round the dormitories, and took me to the door of the library and showed me a crack in the door. I peered in, and I was amazed. There were dozens of books, maybe more than two hundred. Jocelin told me that the library was off-limits to all but the magi, but that most covenfolk could not read, anyway. Then he took me to meet the grogs, the soldiers who had guarded me on the way here. The leader of the grogs is a woman, although I didn't realize that until she spoke. I think I was a bit rude in my confusion, but Maud just laughed and went back to training the others. Jocelin explained that the grogs were there to protect me, and were supposed to die to defend me, if necessary. I asked him why, since I was nobody important. Jocelin laughed then, and sat me down on a mounting block to explain. I will try to write down what he said.

"William, you have the Gift, and you are Julia's apprentice. In a few years you will be a magus, able to command the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. The winds and waves will answer to your will, and the earth itself will rise up to form your dwelling. Age will flee from your face, and flames will shrink from your body in fear. People will see what you wish them to see, and think their thoughts at your whim. The power of a king pales beside that which you may attain, and no-one but the Tribunal of the Order may judge you. You may be only an apprentice now, but everyone here respects what you will become."

I wonder if he is right.

Fifth day of Scorpio, thirteen hundred and thirty ninth year of Aries.
