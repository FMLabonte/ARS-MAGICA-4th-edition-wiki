CHAPTER V
SPELLS
113

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Lantern Oil (+3)

Saturates a porous material with flammable oil. When casting this spell, you make a flicking motion with your index finger and thumb, as if propelling something at the target. A dot of oil appears on the target after the spell is finished, and slowly spreads over the target, saturating enough cloth to cover a person. If used on a person's clothes and ignited, the oil does +12 damage the first round, +6 the second, and +0 the third.

Footsteps of Slippery Oil

R: Personal/Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Snake Fat (+1)

From each of the next ten footsteps the target of this spell takes, nonflammable grease spreads out, leaving a slick area 10 paces wide. Dexterity stress rolls are required to remain upright whenever a character on the oil does something more challenging than walking. A roll of 6+ is needed for the average maneuver, with rolls of up to 15+ needed to (for example) make a right turn at full speed on a smooth, greased surface. Using fat from a snake makes casting slightly easier.

This spell was invented by a rather good-natured magus, and the gestures associated with the most common variations of the spell are as comical as the effects themselves. You can stand first on one leg, and then the other, vigorously rubbing the bottom of each upturned foot, as if spreading on a salve.

Lungs of Water and Death

R: Near/Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Black Onyx (+1)

Fills a target's lungs with water. The target falls to the ground and can do nothing but cough up water. A Stamina stress roll of 6+ averts drowning, but the target is still incapacitated for at least three minutes as he clears the water from his lungs. Casting requisite is Animál for beasts and Corpus for people. Black onyx, which may be used with this spell, is known to be associated with both malediction and death.

Mighty Torrent of Water

R: Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Aimed (-3 to +1)

Spell Focus: An Aquamarine Stone (+3)

A 3-foot-diameter cone of water sprays from your outstretched arms towards your target. During these rounds, you must maintain concentration. Anyone hit by this gusher of water takes +10 damage and must make a Strength + Size stress roll of 9+ or be sent flying back. Targeting is at -3 for the first round, increasing by +1 for every round it is aimed at the same target thereafter. The aquamarine stone aids the spell due to its strong ties to the element of water.

Marbaid of Flambeau's wizard's sigil is connected to his obsession with blood. In his version of the spell, which has a Corpus requisite, the target is hit by a gush of blood, and the stains do not go away until Sunrise/Sunset.

Level 30

Breaking the Perpetual Drought

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Bound, Ritual

Brings normal rainfall to the region suffering from drought.

Level 40

Deluge of Rushing and Dashing

R: Near, D: Conc, T: Bound, Ritual

Spell Focus: A Drop of Water from a Water Elemental (+4)

Causes a stream to flood, starting at the stream's nearest point to you and continuing to 1 mile downstream. If the spell focus is present, it is flicked into the stream, and the flood begins at that precise point. The results of this spell are generally quite impressive. As the river overflows its original bed, it becomes a raging torrent, sucking in everything near it. Damage from the spell can last for many years.

As long as you concentrate, the stream remains at flood levels. Anyone caught near the stream when it floods is struck by the rush of water (+10 damage), caught up in the flood, and dragged along. Every round, a victim makes a Strength + Swim stress roll. A roll of 9+ means the character escapes the flood. Otherwise, the character loses one Fatigue level and takes a +5 damage. Any who fall unconscious drown. This roll is repeated until the character either escapes the flood or dies.

Intéllego Aquam Guidelines

Basic range is Touch, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Small. Note that Intéllego Aquam spells do not normally require requisites for other liquids.

Most sigils manifest in Intéllego Aquam spells by causing the information to be reported in some slightly quirky way. For example, Chavin of Tytalus's version of Voice of the Lake always makes the lake sound strong, masculine, and arrogant.

Level 1: Get an image of water within range.

Level 3: Get an images of water and its immediate surroundings within range.

Level 5: Learn the natural properties of a liquid.

Level 10: Learn the natural properties of a mixture of liquids.

Level 15: Learn the magical properties of a liquid. Make your senses unaffected by water.

Level 20: Learn the magical properties of a mixture of liquids.

Level 25: Speak with a natural body of water.

Level 30: Speak with an artificial body of water (like a fountain).

Intéllego Aquam Spells

Level 5

Subtle Taste of Poison and Purity

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+5)

Determines all the mundane properties of a liquid that you touch with your tongue. The sapphire, which may be used with this spell, provides wisdom.
