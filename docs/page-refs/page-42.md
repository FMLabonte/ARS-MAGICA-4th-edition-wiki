THE ART OF MAGIC

appropriate Personality Traits, and +3 to natural resistance rolls versus certain spells that affect the mind.

Keen Vision: You can see farther and more clearly than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving sight, not including attacks with missile weapons.

Large (companions and grogs): Your Size is +1 instead of 0. This gives you have an extra winded Fatigue level and an extra hurt Body level.

Learn From Mistakes: You are able to improve a particular Ability through the expedient of repeated failure. The first time in a given story that you botch a roll or fail by exactly one point, you gain one experience point in the Ability. You may take this Virtue several times, once for each Ability chosen.

Light Sleeper: You can wake up almost instantly when disturbed and can take action immediately once awake, without the usual penalties. The storyguide may also allow generous Perception rolls to see if noises wake you.

Long-Winded: You can last longer when exerting yourself than most, and gain +3 on all your Fatigue rolls. This bonus does not apply to casting spells.

Magic Sensitivity: You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical effects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from all natural resistance and magic resistance rolls you make. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Magic Sensitivity 1, which can be improved as other Talents. When attempting to sense the magic nature of a place or object, the storyguide will assign an ease factor—simply roll a simple die + Perception + Magic Sensitivity.

Mimicry: You are able to imitate others' voices, as well as animal sounds. Mimicry is far from perfect, though, and you have to work hard to convincingly reproduce a specific person's voice: roll Mimicry + Communication of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Mimicry 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Perfect Balance: You are skilled at keeping your balance, especially on narrow ledges or tightropes. Add +6 to any roll to avoid falling or tripping.

Premonitions: You intuitively sense whenever something is wrong, or is likely to go wrong soon. This Ability can be called upon by you or the storyguide, as appropriate, whenever there is a chance to avoid danger. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Premonitions 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Prestigious Family: Your family is well known and respected. When in dire need, others may help you because of your relatives, or your family itself may provide assistance. You begin the game with a Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who know your family.

Rapid Convalescence: Your body can heal quickly. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to recover from wounds.

Read Lips: You have a limited, self-taught Ability to understand the speech of people you cannot hear, simply by watching their mouths. This Ability is far from perfect, and you get many words confused: roll Read Lips + Perception of 9+ to be accurate in your interpretations. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Read Lips 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Reckless: You tend not to notice that situations are threatening. You start with a Personality Trait of Reckless +3, and can never have a positive Personality Trait reflecting care or patience. Whenever the storyguide deems it necessary for you to check bravery or a similar Personality Trait, make a roll against your Reckless score instead. A success means you do not realize your danger, and can act immediately without further checks.

Second Sight: You are able to see ghosts, demons, and other invisible spirits. A roll of 9+ on Second Sight + Perception is usually

successful, but your target may be higher or lower at the storyguide's discretion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Second Sight 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Secret Hiding Place: You know of a spot that is out of sight or just very difficult to get to, unknown to all but a few (or just yourself) and so is an excellent hiding place when you are in trouble. You may occasionally have problems getting there, but once hidden you are basically safe. However, there is always the risk that someone may find your hiding place, putting you in some kind of a predicament.

Self-Confident: You have firm confidence in your own abilities. You begin the game with one extra Confidence point. You may take this Virtue up to three times, if you wish.

Sense Holiness and Unholiness: You are able to feel the auras of good and evil. A Perception + Sense Holiness and Unholiness roll of 9+ lets you sense holiness or unholiness in a general area; 15+, in a person or object. In auras of particularly strong divine or infernal influence, your sensitivity may overwhelm you. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Sense Holiness and Unholiness 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Sharp Ears: You hear better than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving hearing.

Social Contacts: You have a broad range of acquaintances in a specific social circle (specified when this Virtue is purchased), accumulated over years of travel and socializing. Almost everywhere you go, you meet someone you know, or can get in touch with someone who can help you. Whenever you are somewhere new, you can contact someone on a simple Presence roll of 6+. The storyguide may modify this target number upward for very small areas or areas where it is extremely unlikely that you would know someone. You may purchase this Virtue more than once, each time specifying a different social group.

Strong Personality: For any three Personality Traits, you may have scores from -6 to +6 instead of the usual -3 to +3.

Strong-Willed: You cannot easily be coerced into activities, beliefs, or feelings. You get +3 on any roll which may require strength of will.

Tough: You can take physical punishment better than most people. You get a +3 bonus on your Soak score.

Troupe Upbringing: You were raised among a group of entertainers, spending much of your childhood traveling from town to town. Rolls involving Performance Skills and Physical Talents in a selected area (which you should have approved by the storyguide) receive a +3 modifier. Examples might include tumbling and acrobatics, knife throwing and juggling, or storytelling and acting.

True Friend: You have a very close friend who is your confidant, supporter, and ally in all things. The two of you do not hesitate to help the other, and you do not question each other's needs. Friendship brings obligations as well as benefits—if anything bad happens to your friend, you are distraught (and, if appropriate, vengeful). You and your friend both have a Personality Trait of Loyal +3 to each other.

Venus' Blessing: People are often attracted to you. You get +3 on Communication and Presence rolls with sexually compatible characters in appropriate situations. At times you can put this to good use. At other times it's an annoyance.

Versatile Sleeper: You can fall asleep at will, anywhere, anytime, enjoying sleep whenever you have a few minutes. Thus, each day you get the equivalent of a full night's rest without having to spend the night in unbroken slumber. You can be awakened normally when napping.

Veteran: You spent at least two years campaigning, perhaps on one of the Crusades. During that time, you improved your martial skills to some extent. You may spend seven experience points on Weapon Class Abilities, or any other Abilities that your storyguide
