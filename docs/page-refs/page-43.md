approves of that you might have learned or improved while campaigning. You may take this virtue more than once.

Weather Sense: You are in tune with the subtle nuances of the weather. On a roll of Weather Sense + Perception of 9+, you can sense what the weather will be like the next day, or sooner if conditions are rapidly changing. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Weather Sense 1, which can be improved as other Talents.

Well-Known: You have a good Reputation, level 2, in a particular area near the covenant, and are generally well liked.

Well-Traveled: You have journeyed extensively in this part of the world and find it easy to get along with people throughout the area. You are familiar with regional dialects and can pick others up quickly, giving you +3 to appropriate speaking rolls. In addition you know something of local habits and traditions, giving you get a +3 bonus to appropriate Knowledge rolls, such as Legend Lore.

+2 Virtues

Blackmail: You have information that some powerful person would prefer kept hidden. You receive payments or services in return for your silence, and you may occasionally demand special favors. Don't push your luck—your victim may decide it isn't worth the cost, or silence you permanently. This benefit has a yearly value of about 50 silver pennies, possibly more if you keep the pressure on. You should detail and record the specifics of this arrangement.

Enchanting Music: When you set your mind to it, you can influence others in a specific way with your music. For a specific effect, you must sing words that people can understand. You can calm the grieving with tunes alone, but you need lyrics to convince peasants to rise up against the local lord. When you use Enchanting Music, roll a die (stress or simple, depending on the situation) and add Communication and Enchanting Music. A roll 9+ will calm the upset, a 12+ will win someone's love, a 15+ will incite a riot, an 18+ will touch the heart of a Magus, and a 24+ might win back a soul from the Prince of Darkness. If you botch, you inspire an unwanted emotion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Enchanting Music 1, which can be improved as other talents.

Faerie Friend: You have an ally among the fey. How much assistance you can get depends on the power of the friend—a small faerie with (relatively) minor powers can accompany you on a day to day basis. Powerful faeries have other business, and may only be available to answer questions and provide guidance, not to accompany you around on your adventures. Your ally is fully sentient, has its own powers, and can speak when it chooses. You may want to have another player act the part. While a faerie companion can be a great boon, it can also be a terrible burden. If it is nasty or mischievous, it could cause trouble for you everywhere. Characters with this Virtue can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.

Famous: You have a good Reputation, level 4, in the area surrounding the covenant. You should detail the noteworthy deeds you performed to earn this fame.

Gossip: You have regular social contacts in the area that provide you with all kinds of information about local social and political goings-on. On a simple roll of 6+, you hear interesting news before almost everyone else. You treat all local Reputations as twice their actual level. With some well-placed words, you may be able to bestow new Reputations (whether deserved or not). You quite likely have a Reputation too—as a gossip.

Great (Characteristic): You may raise any Characteristic from +3 to +4. Make sure you describe what it is about you that causes that increase (such as sheer bulk, a lean build, or extreme charisma).

Hex: You have the power to bring injury or ruin to your enemies. You must wish a specific calamity upon a person by cursing him aloud, and the storyguide (based on a stress die roll modified only by your Hex score) determines whether you succeed. Example target numbers are 9+ to cause a calf to be born with three legs, 15+ to bring a debilitating illness in the victim's family, or 21+ to cause the victim to be killed in a strange accident. Assuming the roll is successful, the hex strikes your victim anywhere from a day to a month later. Divine power or magic might offer protection, but a hex can often bypass this by affecting the victim indirectly. Sometimes the Church punishes those whose curses are widely known to have come true. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Hex 1, which can be improved with experience points.

Indulgences: You have a number of indulgences (remissions of sin), which have been bestowed upon you by the Pope. You may sell these, keeping some money for yourself, or you may grant them to individuals in return for "services to the Church" (that is, doing something for you). Each indulgence confirms the remission of one sin, and you can have no more than 20 at any time (roll two dice). When all have been granted or sold, you may purchase more by returning to Rome.

Intuition: You have a natural sensitivity that allows you to make the right decisions more often than luck can account for. Whenever you are given a choice in which luck plays a major role (such as deciding which of three unexplored paths to follow), you have a good chance of choosing correctly. The storyguide should secretly roll a simple die. On a 6+, your intuition kicks in and you make what ever might be considered the "right" decision. Otherwise, you fail to get any flash of insight and must make the decision without aid.

Jack-of-All-Trades: Despite your lack of training, you can attempt things that others equally unskilled would find more difficult. You suffer no penalties to rolls against a Skill in which you have no score, provided you have some time to consider what you are about to do. (There is normally a -3 penalty to use Abilities you do not possess.) Skills that are exclusive to a particular group (such as Hermetic Skills to magi) are still beyond you, unless you belong to the appropriate group.

Training: You have access to a trainer who has a score of 6 in three different Ability Scores, and can teach you during one season each year. This trainer has a +1 Communication. Determine the specifics of the individual and the relationship with your storyguide. You may have to travel to get training, but do not have to pay or provide services in return for it.

Latent Magic Ability: You have a magical quality that has not yet manifested itself. You probably do not realize you have this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguide's discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine).

Lightning Reflexes: You respond to surprises almost instantly. In fact, your reflexes are sometimes so fast that you don't have a chance to think about how you are going to respond. Whenever you are surprised or startled, roll a stress die + Quickness. If you get a 3 or better, you respond reflexively. You must tell the storyguide what one type of action (attacking, blocking, running, etc.) you would like to respond with. If attacking in response, you gain +9 to your Initiative Total. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what happens (though it is always in the best interests of your immediate self-preservation). You only react to threats that you are not fully aware of, so you don't get a bonus against an assassin you watch sneak up on you. Note that you do not get a choice about whether to react. You could just as easily skewer a friend sneaking up in fun as you would an assassin about to strike. Also note that you must perceive an action to react to it—you can still be easily killed in your sleep. This Virtue gives you no special powers of perception.
