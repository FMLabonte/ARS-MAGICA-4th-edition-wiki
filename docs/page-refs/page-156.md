ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

nitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well. The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other types of magic. Further increases in level will yield further information, depending on the design of the specific spell.

Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spell only affects one realm, and storyguides may wish to disallow spells to detect the Divine or Infernal.

As a general rule, residues of magic decline as follows. As soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves. It then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes. Storyguides should employ this as a guideline, not a rigid formula, and may, if they wish, allow high level detection spells to pick up residues with 'negative magnitude'.

Magical items have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawns of vis used to open the enchantment (or half the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices). Magnitudes of non-Hermetic items must be set by the storyguide. A spell to detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice-versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above.

Magical creatures can also be detected. Treat their Might as the level of the effect: for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might or highest Art by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude. Again, this requires a different spell, and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures. Demons may not be detected. Storyguides may, at their option, allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead.

Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrelevant, as is the realm of power that it was designed to detect. However, only specially designed spells will yield any information other than that it is raw vis.

## Intéllego Vim Spells

### General

#### The Invisible Eye Revealed

R: Per, D: Conc/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Eye of Newt (+3)

The caster can see a visual representation of any magical means currently being used to spy on him. The representation varies in a way that depends on the spell, but it often looks like some kind of eye floating in the air. For example, a magus being spied upon with Enchantment of the Scrying Pool might see an eye of the deepest blue color, while a magus who is being tracked by The Inexorable Search might see a representation of a small figure of him moving about a map. This spell detects the use of Intéllego spells of up to double the level of this spell. A special spell is required because most Intéllego spells are designed to be subtle, and they are more subtle at higher levels.

### Level 5

#### Scales of the Magical Weight

R: Touch, D: Inst, T: Small

Spell Focus: A Set of Scales (+3)

When casting this spell, you typically hold your hands straight out from your body, place a known amount of Vim vis in your left hand (usually one pawn), and then place an unknown amount of vis in your right hand. After casting the spell, you may sense how heavy the unknown vis is in relation to the known, determining the number of pawns present. When using the focus to help empower the spell, you place the vis in the pans of the scale, and the scale shifts to make obvious the relationship between the two. A common technique is to enchant one of the pans of the scale with a pawn of vis, as if it were being prepared as a magic item, so that there is no need to carry a pawn of raw vis about. If you cast the spell without anything to measure the unknown vis against, you only have a very general idea of how valuable it is. The spell cannot be used to determine the amount of raw vis invested in an enchanted item.

#### Sense the Nature of Vis

R: Touch/ Near, D: Inst, T: Small

Spell Focus: Sapphire (+5)

You can tell what Art a supply of raw vis is connected to. To you, the vis appears to glow with an aura that is appropriate to the Technique or Form that the vis is associated with. Creo is white, Intéllego gold, Muto constantly fluctuating, Perdo black, Rego purple, Animál brown, Aquam blue, Auram violet, Corpus dark red, Herbam green, Imáginem pearly blue, Ignem bright red, Mentem orange, Terram dark brown, and Vim silver. Some of the colors are very similar, but are easy to distinguish if the item is held steadily and studied for a few seconds.

### Level 30

#### Sense of the Lingering Magic

R: Near, D: Conc, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Sapphire (+1)

This spell can detect the presence of many magical residues, even from weak spells, as well as giving the presence and power of active spells. It does not grant any information apart from the power, however.

### Level 40

#### Sight of the Active Magics

R: Near, D: Conc/Moon, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Ergot (+3)

You can see spells as "auras" around things and people. The color of the aura indicates the Form of the spell working on a subject, the color matching the appropriate one described in Sense the Nature of Vis (above). The Technique of a spell working on the subject is recognized by the aura's shape, not color. Creo and Rego are both very orderly auras. Muto is constantly shifting, and Intéllego usually is as well, but more slowly. A Perdo aura is usually in fragments. Thus, a magus with both Endurance of the Berserkers and The Invisible Eye Revealed upon him has a very controlled, orderly aura of deep red around his or her entire body, and the magus's eyes are surrounded with slowly shifting auras of a silvery hue. You should be warned: Imáginem or Vim spells may be used to disguise auras. Also note that this spell will detect the residues of some spells. The ergot fungus, which may be used in this spell, is a very dangerous faerie plant that grows in wheat. It is sprinkled over your head during the spell.
