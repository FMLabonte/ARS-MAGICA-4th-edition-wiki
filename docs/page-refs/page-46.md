**Ghostly Warder**: A ghost watches over you. It might be a grandparent, a childhood friend, or anyone else who cares for you enough to stay around after death. The ghost is invisible and silent to all but you and those with Second Sight (see page 42). It can see and hear what is going on around you and makes an excellent spy, since it can leave your presence once per day for up to half an hour. However, death does not leave people in their normal state of mind, so the ghost probably has some quirks that make it less than dependable—it might even encourage you to join it on the other side. The ghost has 20 experience points in various Abilities that it can use to advise you.

**Incredible (Characteristic)**: You have an incredible capacity in one of your Characteristics, raising it from +3 to +5. Describe what it is about you that causes the increase (such as sheer bulk, lean muscles, or extreme charisma).

**Magic Resistance**: You have an innate immunity to magical effects and may possess some unusual physical sign, such as a birthmark or iron fingernails. You possess a +20 Magic Resistance, which is incompatible with a Parma Magica.

**Quality Armaments**: Your weapons and armor are of very high quality, giving +2 to your armor’s Protection rating and +2 to Damage for weapons. It takes a skilled artisan (Blacksmith skill of at least 4) to properly repair your armaments. Others are able to mend them, but lack the skill to restore them to their full strength. Armaments so mended can only receive +1 bonuses, at most.

**Ways Of The (Land)**: You have a deep understanding of a type of terrain, feeling more natural and at home there than anywhere else. Examples include Ways of the Forest, Ways of the Mountain, or Ways of the Steppe. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls that directly involve that area and its inhabitants; mundane, magical, or faerie. In addition, you roll one less botch die than normal (but always at least one) in rolls that pertain to your area of understanding. You are not normally molested by animals of the terrain, and though particularly vicious creatures may still attack you, at least they’ll accord you proper respect. You may choose this Virtue multiple times, for different types of terrain.

## +5 Virtues

**Fast Learner (magi)**: You get an extra experience point per story and per year in the summer because of your ability to pick up knowledge faster than normal. You also receive a +1 on rolls to study from vis (before multiplication). You begin the game with 10 extra experience points to use in purchasing Abilities.

**Giant Blood (magi)**: The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.

**Mythic (Characteristic)**: You have may raise one Characteristic from +3 to +5, making it a score of epic proportions. In addition to this increase, once per day you may perform an incredible feat of limited duration (such as lifting an extreme weight, running a great distance in a single day, or using a bow to shoot a cherry out of someone’s hand) related to that Characteristic, without having to make a roll. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what is and what is not an incredible feat—kicking over a mountain and inventing a spell in one day are outside the realm of even mythic characters. Magi with mythic Characteristics can never perform incredible feats of lab work.

## General Flows

## Variable Flows

**Cursed**: You have incurred the enmity of someone or something powerful enough to put a curse on you, which may be magical, divine, faerie, or infernal. The severity of the curse determines the number of Flaw points: in general, the more intense or commonly manifested the effect, the higher the point value. Example –1 Curses: everything you say is taken in the worst possible way, or a live toad appears in your mouth when you speak a direct lie. Example –2 Curses: you stutter uncontrollably when you try to say something important, or if you ever tell a secret that was entrusted to you, the secret somehow harms you. Example –3 Curses: you are pained by light, with greater light bringing greater pain, or you see shapes and phantoms in the night that terrify and immobilize you. Example –4 Curses: you are doomed to be wounded in every battle you take part in (and in some that you try to avoid), or normal tools break whenever you use them.

**Enemies**: Someone is causing trouble for you, such as a local baron or bishop, a band of outlaws, or a really nasty innkeeper. The enemy must be powerful enough to endanger you—this is best agreed on with the storyguide and the rest of the troupe. The value for a local enemy with moderate means is –1. Vastly powerful enemies with considerable means and spare time to spend making your life miserable are worth up to –4.

**Outsider**: You belong to a group that is both readily identifiable and distrusted or disliked. Examples include Saracens, Jews, and Moors. You are shunned and often persecuted because of this, and your life and freedom may occasionally be in peril. You have a bad Reputation of level 1 to 3 (depending upon how easy it is to identify you) among members of the dominant social group of your area. There is no way for you to ever remove that stain, and you are marked by it wherever you go. The cost of this Flaw is equal to the Reputation that it causes.

**Vow**: You have sworn to do something difficult, and breaking your vow is a serious matter. Examples vows include never raising a weapon, never speaking, or living in poverty. If you do fail to uphold your vow, you must perform some kind of atonement, whether it be religious penance or coming to terms with your failure in some other way. Furthermore, you lose one point of Confidence. Depending on your vow, some people may respect your dedication, giving you a good Reputation of level 1 among those people. The cost of this Flaw depends on the severity of your vow and the frequency with which it is tested. The storyguide is the final arbiter of the cost of this Flaw.

## -1 Flows

**Bad Reputation**: People in an area know of you and hold you in ill regard. Choose an appropriate Reputation, level 2, within that area.

**Black Sheep**: You come from a prestigious family, but you have somehow estranged yourself from your relatives. They have nothing to do with you, unless they wish to punish you somehow. Those who resent your family’s power can take safe revenge by assaulting you. You begin the game with a bad Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who respect your family.
