scene, the players should understand why the change is implemented, and the change should make sense. If the rules change without rhyme or reason, the logic of your world collapses. If you do change rules, remember your changes or your stories will lose consistency.

# Health, Aging, Twilight

During the course of a saga, many things will affect the characters' well-being. They will exert themselves in battle and in spellcasting; they will be harmed by weapons and by illness; they will age, wither, and ultimately pass away into death or something else. These are realities of life in Mythic Europe—rules for dealing with them follow.

# Fatigue

Characters who exert themselves in combat and other strenuous activities can become tired and even exhausted. This is measured using Fatigue levels. Most characters have six Fatigue levels, and each is given a name. Listed in order from least fatigued to most fatigued, they are Fresh, Winded, Weary, Tired, Dazed, and Unconscious. Characters are normally Fresh until they perform some strenuous action, such as engaging in combat, casting spontaneous spells, or running a great distance. Strenuous actions require a Fatigue test: roll Stamina + Encumbrance on a stress die against an ease factor of 6. Failure means the loss of one Fatigue Level. A botch costs two. Combat has a different set of rules for fatigue loss that replace those given here. See page 168.

Each Fatigue level above Winded has a penalty associated with it (except for Unconscious, which is its own penalty). Fatigued characters must apply the relevant penalty to all rolls, including further fatigue tests, but not Soak attempts. These penalties represent the effects of growing exhaustion, and are cumulative with those resulting from lost Body levels (see "Wounds," below) The penalty for Weary is -1, for Tired -3, and for Dazed -5.

# Recovery From Fatigue

A character recovers from fatigue one level at a time, starting with the most exhausted level. The table below is a guideline to help you determine how long it will take a character to recover. Recovery from fatigue requires quiet rest; if the character remains active, recovery time is doubled. At the storyguide's option, fatigued characters may make a Stamina roll against an ease factor of 9 when they are recovering. Success allows recovery in half the normal time.

These recovery times only apply to activities that have not been performed over a long period. For any Fatigue levels lost through long-term exertion (like running a long distance, carrying a heavy load all day, or engaging in heavy labor all afternoon), the character can recover only with a good meal and a good night's sleep. It is up to the storyguide to determine the nature of the exertion and whether the character can recover as per the Fatigue Recovery Table or through food and sleep. Stamina rolls to recover from fatigue which resulted from long term exertion or extremely exhausting activity should not be allowed.

A rule of thumb is to consider the most strenuous activity that caused Fatigue loss. Thus, if a character ran a short distance, then engaged in combat, then hiked all day, losing three Fatigue levels, recovery should take considerably longer than it would for any of these singly because of the long-term hiking.

|  **Fatigue Recovery Chart**  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Fatigue Level | Time to recover to next lower level  |
|  Winded | 2 minutes  |
|  Weary | 10 minutes  |
|  Tired | 30 minutes  |
|  Dazed | 60 minutes  |
|  Unconscious | 2 hours  |

# Wounds

Physical damage is recorded in Body levels similarly to the way fatigue is recorded in Fatigue levels. Most humans have six Body levels: Unhurt, Hurt, Light Wounds, Medium Wounds, Heavy Wounds, and Incapacitated.

Whenever a character takes damage from any source, the character uses his Soak score to resist that damage. If the character's Soak equals or exceeds the damage being applied, no significant wounds result. The character may still be bruised, scraped, or singed, depending on the type of attack, but the damage is not enough to take a lasting toll. For every full five points by which the damage exceeds the
