HERMETIC MAGIC

however, is dangerous because of the risk of corruption and because it is against the code of the Order of Hermes. Pronounced ‘WEEM.’

## Raw Vis

Raw magic power, known as vis (pronounced ‘WEES’), is sometimes found stored in and partially constituting some physical substance. This can occur either because a magus has trapped it there or because it was deposited there by natural magical processes. Vis trapped in some substance is called raw vis, and magi have many uses for it.

Raw vis is always associated with a particular Technique or Form. Thus, there is Ignem vis, Creo vis, Imāginem vis—even Vim vis. Raw vis invariably exists in some kind of matter appropriate to the Technique or Form to which it corresponds. Animál vis might be found in blood, skins, or horns; Herbam vis in plant fiber or sap; Terram vis in crystals; and so on. When raw vis is used its power is permanently lost. When this happens its substance usually changes—dissolving, withering, crumbling, shriveling, or otherwise degrading—in whatever way is appropriate to it.

Raw vis can be used in many applications. Examples include strengthening a spell, performing a ritual, creating a magical enchantment, making a spell permanent, or aiding in the study of the magical Art to which it corresponds. Because of its utility, vis is greatly prized by Magi. They often use it as a form of currency, measuring it is units called pawns. Ten pawns are said to make a rook, while ten rooks make a queen. A queen of vis is a legendary quantity, and it would be highly unlikely for a given magus to possess even a sizable fraction of such an amount.

Magi often wear sources of vis in necklaces or rings so that other wizards or magical beings can readily perceive that they have vis to use in response to a threat.

## Limits of Magic

Magic, though a very powerful force, is not omnipotent. There are certain laws it must conform to and certain limits that it can never exceed. These limits to Hermetic magic are drawn from the medieval paradigm of post-Aristotelian, pre-Copernican physics and cosmology, and are described below.

## The Limit of the Lunar Sphere

Hermetic magic cannot affect the lunar sphere, nor anything above it.

## The Limit of Divinity

Hermetic magic cannot overcome the power of the Highest Divinity or the deceptions of infernal powers. Thus it cannot affect the outcome of a miracle, manipulate the mind or body of someone buried in piety by the Church, alter True Faith, detect the presence of the deceptions or illusions of a demon, nor determine the purposes behind those deceptions or illusions.

## The Limit of the Soul

Hermetic magic cannot affect an immortal soul, and so may not create true human life nor restore the dead to life.

## The Limit of Essential Nature

Hermetic magic cannot alter or determine something’s essential nature. Thus it cannot halt or reverse natural aging, prevent or remove Twilight (see page 182) or Decrepitude (see page 181), affect the heart-shape of a Bjornaer magus, nor create, destroy, or alter any supernatural aura.

## The Limit of Creation

Hermetic magic is incapable of creating anything permanently without raw vis, which includes curing permanently without raw vis.

## The Limit of Time

Hermetic magic is incapable of altering the passage of time. It cannot affect anything in the past, and can only affect the future by making changes in the present.
