THE ART OF MAGIC

|  Weapon/Attack | Init | Atk | Dfn | Dam  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Bite | +4 | +5 | +0 | +23  |
|  Breath | +8 | spec. | spec. | spec.  |

Soak: +32

Body levels: OK, 0/0, –1/–1/–1, –3/–3, –5, Incapacitated

## Powers:

Tiny Breath, CrAu 20, 1 point: A cloud of black smoke envelopes one target, coating him with black residue. Each round (including the first) the victim must make a Stamina roll against an ease factor of 9 or lose a Body level. A botch loses two levels. Immersion in water cleanses the poison.

Great Breath, CrAu 30, 12 points: The worm sprays its smoke all around itself, coating everyone within four paces. The worm cannot attack in the round after using this attack.

Vis: 12 pawns Perdo in teeth.

## Ruklin, the Two-Headed Drake

This drake is long and sinuous, and she sports two lizard-like heads on serpentine necks. Her entire body is covered with copper scales. Ruklin has a pair of golden batwings, but it takes some effort to fly; usually she leaps from a high place to make getting off the ground easier. In combat, Ruklin typically bites with one head and exhales flames from the other. In addition, she can use her potent claws.

Adventure Seed: Ruklin has information the characters need; they can force surrender if they destroy one of her heads (each takes half of her Body levels). If they cause too much damage, though, she will die and the knowledge will be lost—and what if they kill the head that has the information?

Characteristics: Int +1, Per +2, Pre –1, Com 0, Str +8, Stm +5, Dex –1, Qik –2

Invisibility, PeIm, 4 points: Ruklin can become invisible as long as no one is looking when she does so.

Vis: 14 pawns Ignem in scales.

## Shashali, the Venomous Riddler

Shashali is a 10-foot-long, drab-colored serpent about as thick as a human thigh. Its head has brightly colored scales that form a fascinating pattern. At the end of its tail is a sharp barb filled with poison. Shashali’s favorite tactic is to distract its target by speaking in a soft voice, while slowly bringing its tail up from the side or rear. It then stings the target and flees. If engaged in a challenging riddle contest, Shashali forgets its murderous intent.

Adventure Seed: Shashali has trapped the characters in some way, but they’ve been forewarned of its nature. Can they distract it with riddles and guard themselves long enough to find a way out?

Characteristics: Int +2, Per +2, Pre +3, Com +4, Str 0, Stm +3, Dex –2, Qik +5

## Fantastic Beasts

Fantastic beasts are not just magical wonders like griffins and pegasi, but also include powerful creatures with limited magical ability but incredible physical prowess. Be careful when you design the latter, though, not to make them too dependent on physical strength; give them a healthy Magic Might or they will succumb to the first spell cast upon them.

When modeling beasts after those of legend, consider how true you want to be to the original story. For example, the Minotaur of Greek myth was a unique being, capable of chal
