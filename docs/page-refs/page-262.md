ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

# Appendix II: Conversion Notes

This is the fourth edition of Ars Magica, and we at Atlas Games are the fourth company to hold the rights to produce the game. First at Lion Rampant, then through White Wolf and Wizards of the Coast, Ars Magica has undergone many revisions. We are pleased to be able to present this fourth edition to you.

It is our hope that this edition will bring many new players to what is already a wildly successful fantasy roleplaying game. However, many of you have been with us in previous editions, and we certainly don't want to forget our loyal fans. To that end, this section provides some notes on converting statistics from the third edition to this edition.

## Characteristics

Under the fourth edition, Characteristics are more limited in scope (generally to +/-3 without the purchase of a Virtue or Flaw) than under previous editions (where +/-5 was common). We don't recommend that you force older characters to conform to the new limits. Simply allow them to continue with the old scores. Note that this will generate some imbalances if characters generated under second or third edition are played alongside characters generated under fourth edition.

## Virtues and Flaws

Many Virtues and Flaws have changed scores or descriptions from the previous edition. If a Virtue or Flaw is no longer present in the fourth edition, continue using the same Virtue or Flaw and translate the rules into the fourth edition as best you can. If a Virtue or Flaw is in fourth edition but has a different value, use the new description, but don't worry about re-balancing the scores.

## Abilities

The Ability list in the fourth edition has been shortened, consolidating Abilities in many places. Where several old Abilities have been subsumed under a new one, convert the scores in second or third edition Abilities to experience points, then use those points to increase the corresponding fourth edition Ability. For example, a third edition character with Alertness 2, Scan 2, and Search 2 would spend the 9 experience points that have been invested in the three into Awareness. This would purchase him a score of 3, with 3 extra experience points applied to the next level.

The table on the left lists Abilities from third edition that have been removed, and what fourth edition Abilities their experience points should apply to.

## Reputations

Reputations have only changed slightly. Simply add the target of the Reputation, keeping the score and actual Reputation constant.

## Combat

The most substantive change in the game is almost without a doubt the revision of the combat system. The most problematic translation to this system is in the translation of combat Abilities. To keep things fair, we recommend that you total the number of experience points that a given character has spent on those Abilities, and then apply that number of experience points toward purchasing scores in the new Abilities that approximate those from third edition. For example, scores in skills like Longsword Attack and Mace Parry would apply to either Single Weapon or Shield and Weapon (or could be split among the two).

Once Ability score are worked out, it should be a simple matter to calculate the new fourth edition combat scores as usual.

## Spells

With the new system of ranges, durations, and targets, and because of the new way that guidelines are used to determine the levels of spells, some of the standard spells have had their levels adjusted. We recommend that you record the statistics and levels of the fourth edition spells, and use those in the place of the old ones.

## Books

Assume that all third edition books are Summae. Keep the levels constant, and give each work a Quality equal to half the level.

## Covenants

The system for covenant creation has changed a great deal from third edition. We recommend that you re-create your covenant from scratch using the new rules. You may wish to ignore the season guidelines, and instead go through the covenant traits and simply work out their scores based on what you already know of your covenant from past experience.

## Effects of Aging

Characters who have aged under third edition should keep their characteristics at the reduced levels, and begin to develop afflictions as they are played under fourth edition. Decrepitude converts directly to fourth edition.
