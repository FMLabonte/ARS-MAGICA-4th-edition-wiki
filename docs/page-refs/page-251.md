CHAPTER XII

lenging a hero's might. Do you want your minotaur to be something similar, an awe-inspiring beast lurking in a maze, something worth telling stories about? Perhaps you visualize your minotaurs as a mighty race with a nasty disposition for human flesh, but nothing truly exceptional.

## Griffin

The griffin has a lion's body with an eagle's forequarters. It generally attacks with its talons, reserving its beak for tearing the flesh of its prey and for emergency use. Although ferocious when threatened or hungry, the griffin is not entirely malicious; it embodies bravery and hunting prowess. This nature makes it resistant to spells that would cripple or calm it.

**Adventure Seed**: Living atop a rocky crag high in the Pyrenees is a flock of griffins. Dwelling with them is an ancient hermit who is their leader, though he never leaves the nest. He has forgotten how old he is; he speaks only Classical Latin and says he's the Emperor's messenger. The characters encounter the hermit and may want to discover the mystery of his past.

## Giants and Ogres

Legend says that Cain fathered a brood of monstrous children by a demoness. Over the years these creatures, giants and ogres, have spread across the face of Mythic Europe; some are as tall as trees, while others are human-sized but stronger than bulls. They all have brute strength, often great size, and usually hatred and envy of their more beautiful human cousins. A few have exotic abilities, such as shapeshifting, resisting normal types of damage, or using spell-like powers.

## Hierbent, Giant of the Frozen Wastes

Hierbent is a sullen giant who roams the snowy, windswept peaks, and keeps treasures hidden under massive rocks on various mountaintops. He has a huge, frost-covered beard and carries a mighty axe, which was forged for him by dwarfs. Over the years he has slain seven knights, and is eager to exchange boasts with his opponents before engaging in battle. When the winter is hard Hierbent strides down into the valleys and farmlands to vent his rage. He is always accompanied by a severe storm on these trips into the lowlands.

**Adventure Seed**: An early thaw catches Hierbent farther from his mountains than he would like. As a result he's stranded on a mountaintop near the covenant, unable to cross the warm valleys below. The characters can hunt the giant down to kill him, or they can help him back home in exchange for some of his treasure.

**Powers**:

**Cloak of Snows**, CrAu 40, 0 points: Hierbent is almost always surrounded by swirling snow or sleet driven by mighty winds, even when he is in lowland regions. This makes fighting him difficult (-2 to offensive and defensive scores, and one extra botch roll). This power only works when the temperature is near or below freezing.

**Vis**: 16 pawns Corpus vis in body, 7 pawns Terram vis in axe.

## Shapeshifters

Peasants fear the vicious creatures of the wilds, but dread even more the terrible beings that walk as beasts at night, but appear human during the day. Mortals in beast form are more cunning, bloodthirsty, and magical—and less predictable—than the animals whose shape they
