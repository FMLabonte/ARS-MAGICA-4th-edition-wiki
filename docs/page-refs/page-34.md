# Hermetic Virtues and Flaws

## Variable Virtues

**Cyclic Magic** (positive): Your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature (solar, lunar, or seasonal, for example) and as such, is more potent at specific times. At those times, you receive a bonus to all spell rolls and Lab Totals. The cycle of your magic must be regular and approved by the storyguide. Furthermore, the length of time when the bonus applies must be equal to the amount of time when it does not. This Virtue costs two points for each +3 bonus you receive at the peak of the cycle.

**Follower of Bjornaer**: Available only to magi who are members of House Bjornaer. See page 21.

**Magical Affinity**: You are attuned to a specific kind of magic. This gives you a special Arcane Talent, Affinity with (Subject), at an initial score of 1. You may add your Affinity score to all spell rolls and Lab Totals involving that kind of magic. You may increase this rating just as you increase other Talents—by spending experience points. The cost of this Virtue depends on the kind of magic the Affinity applies to. +1 Magical Affinities are narrow or uncommon magical circumstances: demons, water creatures, ghosts and corpses, and self-transformation are examples. +2 Magical Affinities are more common or useful: healing, forests and forest animals, faerie, and rock are examples. +3 Magical Affinities can cover an entire Form—Terram or Mentem, for example. +4 Magical Affinities can apply to an entire Technique, such as Creo or Muto. The storyguide is the final arbiter of the cost of a proposed Magical Affinity.

**Method Caster**: You are excellent at formulaic spells, as you have perfected a consistent and precise method for casting them. For every point invested in this Virtue, you gain a +1 bonus to any formulaic spell you cast. However, if you vary at all from your precise method (by altering your gestures or voicing), you do not get this bonus.

## +1 Virtues

**Adept Student**: You digest the instruction of others quite easily. You get a +6 bonus to Lab Totals when learning spells or when working from the lab texts of others.

**Deft Art**: You are particularly skilled with one Art. You suffer only half the normal penalty for casting spells in that Art under unusual circumstances and when using non-standard voicings/gestures.

**Extra Arts**: You start with 10 extra points to purchase Magical Arts. This Virtue may be taken more than once.

**Extra Spells**: You start with 10 extra levels of spells. This Virtue may be taken more than once.

**Faerie Magic** (Merinita only): See page 25. This Virtue can be made available to magi of other houses at the option of the troupe or storyguide.

**Fast Caster**: Your magic takes less time to perform than that of other magi. You gain +3 in engagement contests when casting spells.

**Free Study**: You are better at figuring things out for yourself than you are at poring over books. Add +1 to rolls when studying from raw vis (before multiplication).

**Gentle Gift**: Unlike other magi, whose Magical nature disturbs normal people and animals, your Gift is subtle and quiet. You do not suffer the usual penalties on rolls for interacting with people and animals.

**Hermetic Prestige**: Because of something in your background, other magi look up to you even if you haven't earned their respect. Some envy you, and most will certainly expect more from you than from others. You gain a Reputation of level 3 within the Order.

**Inventive Genius**: Invention comes naturally to you. You receive +3 on Lab Totals when you invent new spells, craft magic items, and make potions. If you experiment, you get +6.

**Mastered Spells**: You have 10 experience points to use in mastering spells. See page 75 for details on mastered spells. You may take this Virtue more than once.

**Quaesitor**: You are a judge of the Order of Hermes. You are respected, if not necessarily liked, by other members of the Order. Your office involves specific duties and responsibilities, and you start with an appropriate Reputation of level 3 within the Order. Beginning magi will very rarely have this Virtue unless they are members of House Guernicus (commonly called House Quaesitor).

**Secret Vis Source**: You have a secret or personal supply of vis (raw magical energy) that you alone can use. You gain one pawn of vis per season (four pawns a year); the source and type is determined in consultation with the storyguide. You do not start with any of this vis, though, having spent it or just discovered how to get it. Depending on the general availability of vis in a given Saga, the storyguide may want to adjust the value of this Virtue.

**Special Circumstances**: You are able to perform magic better in certain uncommon situations (such as during a storm or while touching the target), gaining a +3 bonus to your rolls to cast or resist spells.

**Strong Writer**: You write about magic with great speed and enthusiasm. You copy spells from your shorthand at (Scribe Latin x 40) levels per season, and copy (Scribe Latin x 90) levels of spells that have already been written out per season. All summae, libri quaestionum, and tractatus you write have a +3 Quality. When writing summae, you accumulate two more levels per season than normal. You copy summae at (Scribe + Dexterity) x 4 levels per season.

## +2 Virtues

**Cautious Sorcerer**: You are very careful with magic, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail. You roll one less botch die (minimum roll of one die) when casting spells (either spontaneous or formulaic), and when working in the laboratory.

**Quiet Magic**: You can cast spells using only a soft voice at no penalty, and at only a -5 penalty if you do not speak at all. You gain no benefits from using your voice normally or using a booming voice.

**Side Effect**: Your magic has some incidental feature that is generally useful, though occasionally annoying. The intensity of the side effect increases with the level of the spell. Examples include a commanding presence when casting that translates into a temporary +1 Presence bonus for a short time after casting, or a calm state of mind derived from casting which allows a bonus on Concentration rolls for a short time after casting.
