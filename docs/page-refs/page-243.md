because of these varying viewpoints. Regardless of opinions, it cannot be denied that the divine realm has an influence over the other realms, including that of magic. A divine aura limits the efficiency and effectiveness of Hermetic magic, and divine miracles can accomplish feats that magi cannot.

At its worst, the Church is a repressive force that treads on liberal thought. At its best, the Dominion allows the human soul to express its deepest beauty. It makes sense, then, that it is the Church which is the driving force behind the Crusades while it produces the most delightful music, the most enchanting art, and the most transcendent philosophy.

The power of the Church and the boundaries it imposes on the Order of Hermes cause many magi to scorn the divine. It is very difficult for people who can summon hurricanes and cause earthquakes to worship a higher power. A few magi, however, are professed Christians and are pious; there are even a few who have what the Order calls True Faith: vera fides. The Christian magus has the most trying life to lead, constantly attempting to reconcile two value systems that defy each other.

# Divine Areas

The Dominion is nearly ubiquitous, and is the only supernatural power that the common folk generally have contact with. It affects magi and their fellows whenever they enter a village, town, or city where there is a place of worship, an ordained priest, and a body of believers. The strength of a divine aura depends on the piety of the believers who participate in it, the size of the populated area, and the faith of the clergy within the area. See the table below for the relative magnitudes of divine auras.

Though divine auras are usually constant in areas inhabited by believers, their strength can vary. On Sundays and holy days the power of the Dominion increases; at night and on evil days it wanes. The Dominion is also focused more strongly in places and objects that are strongly associated with faith. People, places, and things that have been blessed by an ordained priest can carry divine auras, but these are extremely fragile and vanish once exposed to the sinful world. Divine auras somehow transported to another realm are also swallowed by the alien aura.

Entering a strong divine aura has a definite sensory association. Non-magical people often experience anticipatory nerves and unconscious reverence. Those who are pious feel quiet peace; others feel dread and guilt. Magi and others with magical talents instantly sense a powerful presence, their Gift flickering as a flame exposed to wind. Auras of lesser power might prove a mild irritant to such magical folk, perhaps causing headaches, short tempers and feelings of physical discomfort.
