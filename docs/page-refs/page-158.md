ARS MAGICA
THE ART OF MAGIC

All the magi in the gathering who know Wizard's Communion add the level at which they know it to get the effective level of the Wizard's Communion. This combined total must be at least twice the level of the specified spell being cast.

Each magus rolls for fatigue and for success as if casting the specified spell himself. However, the target number for the spellcasting roll is the spell's level divided by the number of magi participating in the Communion. So if five magi participate to cast a 50th level spell, each would have to successfully cast a 10th level spell—with all the relevant requisites, of course. If any magus fails to cast the spell, the whole spell fails. If all succeed, the spell is cast. Any vis needed to cast the spell may be split between the magi involved in the Communion, and the penetration of the final spell is either the spell level, or the highest Penetration total rolled by a participant, whichever is higher. The use of this spell does not increase the number of botch dice required, but each magus in the communion has the chance to botch the common spell.

Communion is a remnant of Mercurian rituals, so spontaneous spells may not be cast by this means, and it does not perfectly fit into the guidelines of Hermetic theory. This spell is usually used to cast protection spells on the covenant—spells that are too powerful for a single magus to cast, or even learn.

## Level 15

### Gather the Essence of the Beast

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Silver Globe (+3)

Concentrates the raw vis in a corpse into one part of that corpse, which can then be removed. This spell lets you gather all the raw vis you find without lugging around entire corpses of beasts. Note that the vis in many magical creatures is already concentrated in this manner in some specific organ, though this spell will allow you to relocate that vis if you wish.

## Perdo Vim Guidelines

The basic range is Reach, the basic duration is Instant, and the basic target is Individual.

Gen: Make something (including a magical item) seem nonmagical to any Intéllego spell of less than twice the level of this spell. Basic duration for this is Sun.

Gen: Dispel effects of a specific type with a casting total less than the level of the Vim spell + a quality die. A specific type could be Hermetic Terram magic, or Shamanic spirit control magic. A magus must have some knowledge of a type of magic (although not necessarily ability to use it) to invent a spell to affect it. All Hermetic magi have some knowledge of all Hermetic magic.

Gen: Reduce a target's Might by one point for every point by which the level of the Vim spell + a quality die exceeds its Might. Different spells are required for creatures tied to different Realms.

Gen: Dispel any magical effect with a casting total less than half the level of the Vim spell + a quality die.

Gen: Reduce the casting total for all magic cast by, in, or on the target by half the level of the spell. Note that one spell will either reduce totals for magic cast by the target, or in

the target, or on the target, but not two or three of them. Which one is to be affected must be determined at the time the spell is invented. Basic duration is Sun. If two or more such spells affect one target, only the highest has any effect: the penalties do not add.

## Perdo Vim Spells

### General

### Demon's Eternal Oblivion

R: Near/Sight, D: Inst, T: Ind

Spell Focus: Pure Red Coral (+3)

Weakens and possibly destroys a demon. Roll a quality die + this spell's level - 5. For every point by which you exceed the target's Infernal Might, it loses one point of Infernal Might. If its score drops to 0, the demon is banished back to Hell for an indeterminate amount of time. If you know the demon's true name, you may double your roll, due to the Law of Names, which, like the Laws of Contagion and Sympathy, may be used to strengthen your spells. Note that repeated castings of this spell are particularly effective, as the earlier castings reduce the number that you have to beat.

### Disenchant

R: Touch/Near, D: Inst, T: Ind, Ritual

Spell Focus: A Pinch of Salt (+1)

You make a Hermetic magic item lose all its powers permanently if the level of this spell + 5 + a quality die exceeds the highest level of the enchantments in the item. The enchantment is utterly destroyed, as is all of the vis that was used in the magic item. The object left is in all ways a mundane item, but could be invested with enchantments again at a later time.

### Masking the Odor of Magic

R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Year, T: Ind

Spell Focus: A Dab of Skunk Musk (+3)

Prevents the detection of a magic spell, or of a magic power in an item or being, by InVi magic, unless the Penetration roll of the InVi spell exceeds twice the level of this spell + 5 (for example, exceeds 15 for a level 5 version).

### Wind of Mundane Silence

R: Reach/Near, D: Inst, T: Room

Spell Focus: Amber (+3)

You raise a metaphorical "breeze" that blows the magic away from an area, canceling the effects of any spell there. You can cancel the effects of any spell if, with this spell, you can double the original caster's Technique + Form score (at the time he or she cast the spell) on a quality die + the level of your spell - 5. If the spell to be eliminated was not cast by a Hermetic magus, the number to match is double the caster's Might score. If the spell was from a magic item, the value to beat is double the level of the spell. Parmae can be blown down if the total exceeds double (5 x Parma Magica). Wind of Mundane Silence does not affect spells of Instant duration. Magical things near the area of the Wind wave slightly from the "breeze."
