## Welcome!

Welcome to **Ars Magica™**, and to the world of **Mythic Europe™**. It is a place where the glories of the Classical world are dust and the promise of the Renaissance is yet to come. The time is the 13th century—1220 to be exact. Life is a struggle: wars and plagues stalk the land, the Church and kings rule with an iron fist. Yet Mythic Europe is also a place of magical wonder, inhabited by all the creatures of folktale and myth. What the folk of the land believe holds true: faeries and rural spirits must be placated; demons corrupt everything they touch; divine power is accessible through prayer; and magic is everywhere.

Against this background, you will play a magus, a member of the mystical **Order of Hermes**. Your character will wield the magical energy that pervades the world, and seek great arcane knowledge. You and your fellow players will also portray the loyal companions and grogs that stand with the magi in their covenants. These stalwart protectors provide a buffer between the magi and the mundane world that often misunderstands their power and motives. This is the setting for **Ars Magica**.

### Overview

**Ars Magica** is full of special terms and concepts. Most of these will be unfamiliar to you, even if you are a roleplaying veteran. Although all the information that you need to know is presented in detail in its own sections, this section provides an overview of **Ars Magica**'s background and mechanics.

### Playing Ars Magica

**Ars Magica** is meant to be played by a group numbering anywhere from three to ten or more. This association of players is called a **troupe**. Unlike many other roleplaying games, in **Ars Magica**, each troupe member controls a number of distinct characters, not just one. In most **Ars Magica** troupes, different players take turns leading the story, that is, setting out the plot, the action, and playing the roles that are not handled by other players. The person who is leading the story at any given time is called the **storyguide**. Usually the storyguide has created a long-term plot against which individual adventures are set. This overarching storyline is called the **saga**, and the shorter adventures within it are **stories**.

#### Characters in Mythic Europe

There are three types of characters in **Ars Magica**. **Magi** are characters with the **Gift**—they can work magic. Antoninus of Jerbiton, from the Introduction to this book, is an example of a magus. **Companions** are powerful characters that do not have the Gift, but associate with the magi for other reasons that are as diverse as are the companions themselves. Jocelin, from the Introduction, is an example of a companion. **Grogs** are the minor characters that do grunt work for the magi and companions. Guards, cooks, and stablehands are all examples of grogs. Together, magi, companions, and grogs all live together in places called **covenants**.

There are many covenants scattered throughout Mythic Europe, and all are members of a confederation of wizards known as the **Order of Hermes**. The Order of Hermes (or just "the Order") is made up of twelve **Houses**, each of which is a magical lineage of masters and apprentices that spans centuries. Although members of a particular house tend to share the same prejudices, strengths, and outlooks, there is still considerable variety among individuals from the same house.

#### The Art of Magic

Wizards in the Order of Hermes practice **Hermetic magic**. Under the Hermetic system of magic, magi create spells by using combinations of 15 magical **Arts**. There are five **Techniques**, governing the manipulation of magical energy, and ten **Forms**, the material that can be manipulated by the spell. You can think of the Technique as a verb,
