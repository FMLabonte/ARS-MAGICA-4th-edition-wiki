## Getting Hurt and Dealing Damage

Mythic Europe is a dangerous place, and magic is far from a precise art. Casting spells under stressful circumstances, or exerting oneself physically, is tiring. A character starts with a number of Fatigue levels, which are marked off progressively as the character becomes more and more fatigued.

Body levels show how badly hurt a character is, and are recorded in a similar manner to Fatigue levels. A character who is taking physical damage often has a chance to Soak, reducing the amount of injury that is actually caused.

Combat is a relatively common occurrence in Mythic Europe. There are a number of combat totals that each character has, which quantify how successful the character will be at various combat endeavors. These totals include Initiative, Attack, Defense, Damage, Soak, and Fatigue.

### The Use of Latin

Latin was the language of Western scholarship in the Middle Ages, and anyone who wanted to be thought "civilized" had to know it. The Order of Hermes grew from a Roman tradition, and so Latin is used frequently in magical terminology.

We have used Latin to add flavor to the game setting (for example, the names of the magical Arts are Latin). The Latin terms used are readily understandable, and are explained in the text where they first appear.

### Mechanics and Dice Rolling

In **Ars Magica**, each character has a set of **Characteristics**, which determine his innate ability in several areas, and a set of **Abilities**, which quantify his learned and practiced skills. Usually, a score in one Characteristic is added to a score in one Ability to determine how well the character performs a given task. For example, a character attempting to recall an important fact about dragons would add his score in Intelligence (a Characteristic) and his score in Legend Lore (an Ability) to generate a total that will indicate how well he can perform the remembering task.

In most cases where characters are tested, outcomes are uncertain. The success or failure of such actions is simulated through a die roll, made at the direction of the storyguide. All die rolls in **Ars Magica** are made on ten-sided dice. These are marked with the numbers 0 through 9, and are available at most game and hobby stores. There are three different ways that the ten-sided die can be used in **Ars Magica**, and the method depends on the situation. Usually the rules will tell you which way to use the dice, but sometimes the storyguide must make the decision.

**A simple die** is rolled in a situation when the variability of possible results is low and there is little likelihood of spectacular success or failure. Read the number as rolled; a 0 counts as 10.

**A quality die** is useful in situations where there is a chance of extraordinary success, but no risk of devastating failure. Read the number as rolled; a 0 counts as 10. If the result is 1, you may roll the die again, doubling whatever number comes up. If a second 1 comes up, reroll and quadruple the next number; a third 1 means multiply the result by 8; and so on.

**A stress die** is rolled when a character is in a critical situation. People under stress are scared and therefore give it all they've got. They are capable of extraordinary feats but can also make disastrous mistakes. Stress rolls can also be called for in situations where there is a chance of great success or abysmal failure, even if the situation is not particularly stressful. If you roll a 1 on a stress die you may roll the die again, doubling whatever number comes up, and so on, just like a quality die roll. If you initially roll a 0 on a stress die, it counts as a 0, not a 10, and you usually must check to see if you botch. To check for a botch, roll again. This second die is called a **botch die**. If your botch die comes up 0 your character has botched—something has gone horribly wrong. Your character has failed, regardless of the final modified score of the die, and some special penalty, devised by the storyguide, generally applies. In particularly tricky situations, you may have to roll more than one botch die. Each extra 0 rolled increases the severity of your failure. Note that any result other than a 0 on a botch die is disregarded.

No matter which way the die is rolled, the result is added to the sum of the character's Characteristic and Ability. This total sum must meet or exceed an ease factor that is either assigned by the storyguide or written out in the rulebook. The ease factor will be higher for difficult tasks, and lower for easier tasks.

Often, modifiers other than the appropriate Characteristic and Ability will apply to a given die roll. Advantages or disadvantages are sometimes stipulated in the rules, or the storyguide may assign modifiers based on the specific situation. These modifiers should be added in to the total before comparison to the ease factor.

For example, say that the character above was trying to remember a specific weakness of dragons. In order to remember, the storyguide says that he must beat an ease factor of 9. His Intelligence is +1 and his Legend Lore is 4. He rolls a stress die (the storyguide deems that there is a chance of a botch—he could remember incorrectly and put himself in a load of jeopardy), getting a 5. His total is 10, which exceeds the ease factor. He successfully remembers the fact. Had he rolled a 0, he would have to roll a botch die to see if he had botched and remembered incorrectly. Had he rolled a 1, he would have rolled again, doubling the result and adding his Intelligence and Legend Lore.

#### A Note on "You"

In this book the word "you" refers alternatively to you, the reader and player, and to you as a magus or other character in the game. Take this as an invitation to see the world through the eyes of your character. You should not take this to mean that you, the reader, can somehow research this book in order to gain supernatural powers, or that we at Atlas Games are somehow imparting you, the reader, with such supernatural knowledge.

Let context and common sense be your guide.
