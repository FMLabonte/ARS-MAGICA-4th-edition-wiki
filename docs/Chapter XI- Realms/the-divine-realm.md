## The Divine Realm

The divine realm is the manifestation of the supernatural power of God, the Church, and all those with faith in His existence. The church views other auras as evil, aligned with the forces of Hell. Magi, of course, often beg to differ. The Church and the Order of Hermes are often at odds

### True Faith

Those who give up mundane pursuits entirely and selflessly dedicate themselves to leading holy lives benefit from True Faith. True Faith is measured in Faith points, which represent a person's connection to God.

Characters with the True Faith Virtue begin the saga with one Faith point. Others can gain one point by spending at least one year in selfless service to God, if their motivations are pure. Characters concerned only with recognition, esteem, and power do not get the Faith point. A character can only gain more Faith points through extreme devotion to Christianity, and these are lost if he turns even slightly from the path. A person with even a single Faith point is rare; someone with five or more is exceedingly holy and will most likely be canonized after death. Such people can be clergy, though many are extremely reverent lay persons. Most of those with many Faith points attain them very late in life.

Faith points offer protection from all manner of supernatural powers. Any time the character might be affected by magic, good or bad, roll a simple die. If the result is equal to or lower than your character's Faith point total, the magic has no effect; indeed, he is immune to magic during the entire encounter.

Some holy relics carry Faith points. A person with True Faith can add those points to his own when rolling to resist magical effects. Furthermore, these relics can protect the faithful who have no Faith points of their own. The relic's score acts just like the True Faith virtue for those who bear it, using its rating as a number of Faith points.

True Faith is also useful to those that possess it when they are sorely tried in the name of God. True Faith can be used just like Confidence ([see page 192](../page-refs/page-192.md)), as long as its use is consistent with the teaching and values of the Church.

### Miracles

Miracles are the will of the divine made manifest in the world. They come from a power above the Earth, so no mundane or infernal force can stop them, nor is there a magic resistance roll against them. They are everyday events in the lives of saints, but to everyone else they are incredibly rare happenings.

It is impossible to bargain for a miracle: God either sends one or does not, and there's very little one can do to influence that decision. A miracle may occur if a person is very pious, if he is acting in accordance with and aiding the cause of the divine, if he prays earnestly and selflessly for aid, and if it seems right in the context of the story.

The most common response to a request for aid is refusal. This usually happens when the supplicant is not sincere or has caused the trouble requiring help, though sometimes help is denied as a test of faith. If the request for a miracle is particularly exploitative or self-fulfilling, it may attract the attention of a demon ready to make a deal.

A miracle will most often be granted in a subtle or unobtrusive way, such as an inexplicable compulsion to ride out on patrol and thus detect an otherwise hidden threat. The rarest outcome is an impressive spectacle, like clouds parting as a flight of angels descends from Heaven to buoy the character up out of danger's way.

The storyguide is the sole and final arbiter of when and where miracles occur. Keep in mind that miracles should not become commonplace occurrences—this cheapens their impact, which should be truly magnificent.
