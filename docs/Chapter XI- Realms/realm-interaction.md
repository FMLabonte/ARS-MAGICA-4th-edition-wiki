## Realm Interaction

The aura of a given place affects all supernatural activities that go on in that place. The list below defines how aura ratings affect various activities. The Realm Interaction chart that follows indicates the degree to which realms influence powers of other realms. The modifiers shown apply to the effect an aura has on any supernatural act performed within it.

Auras also affect the number of botch rolls for an attempted supernatural act in a foreign realm. For each point of aura rating, roll an extra botch die. Use the original aura rating, not that obtained after multiplying by a factor in the Realm Interaction chart.

### Supernatural Activity Rolls Modified by Aura

- Spellcasting rolls: For spontaneous spells, apply the realm interaction modifier before division.
- Lab totals: This applies to lab activities where aura rating is specifically listed as a factor.
- Resistance rolls: Both magical and natural resistance are affected.
- Ability rolls: The aura rating affects supernatural Abilities conferred by some Exceptional Talents, like Entrancement or Sense Holiness and Unholiness. It does not affect Knowledges.
- Study scores: This applies to studying an Art from raw vis (see "Learning Arts from Vis" on [page 190](../page-refs/page-190.md)).
- Power levels: This refers to powers that operate automatically or at will (like those of faeries or some enchanted items). The aura rating increases or decreases the level of the power, which may also gain new effects (as chosen by the storyguide) that suit the new level. If its level is reduced to 0, the power cannot function.
- Weapon scores: This includes any magically enhanced First Strike, Attack, Parry, and Damage bonuses.
- Protection score: As with weapons, the aura rating affects enchanted armor.

### Realm Interaction Table

Power Used

|  Aura Type | Magic | Divine | Faerie | Infernal  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Magic | + aura | - aura | + (1/2 aura) | - aura  |
|  Divine | - aura | + aura | - (2 x aura) | - (3 x aura)  |
|  Faerie | + (1/2 aura) | - (2 x aura) | + aura | - (aura)  |
|  Infernal | - aura | - (2 x aura) | - (2 x aura) | + aura  |

For example, a magus (affiliated with the realm of magic through the virtue of possessing the Gift) casts a spontaneous spell in a town which has a divine aura of 3. He will be forced to subtract 3 from his roll. If that magi were to cast the same spell in an area with a faerie aura of 4, he would add 2 to his roll.
