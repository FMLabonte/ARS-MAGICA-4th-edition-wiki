## The Mundane

The mundane is the embodiment of all that is normal and mortal. Generally speaking, areas not occupied by another realm are considered mundane and consist of ordinary people and places. The mundane has no aura rating—in fact, it is the absence of aura, so powers used there function without hindrance.

There is a difference between "mundane society" and mundane areas. Mundane society comprises the everyday folk of Mythic Europe, including peasants, townsfolk, and nobility. These people, not being supernatural, would seem to belong to the mundane. However, widespread belief in God, and the fact that most settlements are within the Dominion, means that most "mundanes" actually share somewhat in the divine. Only complete outsiders who lack faith are truly be considered part of the mundane.
