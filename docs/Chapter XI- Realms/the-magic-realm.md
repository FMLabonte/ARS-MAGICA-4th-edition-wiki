## The Magic Realm

Magic is commonly described as a subtle, intangible fluid that flows through the world. Hermetic magi call this substance vis. Just as one can use water to turn a mill, one can learn to harness vis to perform all manner of wonders. Hermetic magi are the most versatile manipulators of vis, but other wizards use it and countless creatures subsist on it. As powerful as it is, though, vis is an earthly substance, and as such can have no effect on things beyond the limit of Earth. Only divine power can alter such things as life, death, and the eternal fate of an immortal soul.

It's important to note the difference between "fluid" and "raw" vis. Fluid vis is omnipresent. Magi cast spells by manipulating it. Raw vis is the physical manifestation of fluid vis which has become trapped in a suitable material. It can be harvested to aid in the use of magic. One must go out and find raw vis, whereas fluid vis can be manipulated almost anywhere by those skilled in its use.

### Magical Areas

Magical areas are places where magical energy naturally accumulates. Sometimes, after the working of powerful magic or the death of a powerful creature, places acquire a magical aura, but most of the time it is unclear why a certain place is magical. Most magical areas have an aura from 1 to 5. Legendary places are rated around 6, while auras of strength 10 are virtually unknown.

Magical areas are intense. Colors are more striking, sounds more piercing, the day brighter, the night deeper. Mundane people who live in magical areas tend to get "weird," their bodies and personalities warping. Insidiously, the magic penetrates their very core and permanently transforms them.

Almost all covenants are located in magical areas, usually with aura ratings of 1 to 5. More powerful areas are not only rare but extremely dangerous to live in. The powerful magic there is difficult and dangerous to harness, and mundane covenfolk become warped and strange. Apprentices are often overpowered. Because of this threat, only the most powerful covenants in Hermetic history have based themselves in such places.
