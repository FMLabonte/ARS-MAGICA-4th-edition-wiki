## The Infernal Realm

The infernal realm is the embodiment of evil and decay—of physical destruction and moral corruption. Even as the Church works its divine power to protect the soul and buoy it up to Heaven after the body's death, the forces of the Devil work to steal it away and drag it to the depths of Hell.

Human beings are subject to death and damnation through the sins of their ancestral parents. Once Adam and Eve had tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, all the world came under Satan's influence. Fortunately, humanity is capable of salvation because their understanding of evil is as incomplete as their knowledge of the divine.

Demons are fallen angels; they cannot and will not be redeemed because of their very natures. They comprehend the divine order completely and so can never be convinced by new arguments or perspectives to seek salvation. Their envy of humanity's place in the cosmos is without bounds, as is their capacity for evil as rejection of all that is from God. Ultimately, devils seek to weigh down souls with the baggage of sin. They have an eternity to plot and scheme, and

a human lifetime is a brief moment in their eyes. For this reason, their plans can seem quite opaque.

Hell's most potent allies are diabolists, humans who sell their souls in return for powers and favors on Earth. Not only do devils win these souls away from the divine, they are also able to satisfy their lust for chaos, destruction and suffering through these human agents. The powers that diabolists are awarded can include spell-like abilities and the capacity to summon demons and use them to their own ends, among other things.

Not surprisingly, the Order of Hermes forbids dealings with demonkind. Any member caught engaging in diabolism is renounced and singled out for destruction. Furthermore, the Church brings down great punishments on those thought or known to be in league with the Devil.

When demons are unable to further genuine diabolism, they nurture the next best thing: paganism. This offers the Devil a way to stalemate the Dominion, because pagan worship is diffuse and not directed toward the one true Deity. The more dark and bloody forms of pagan religion can prove useful to Hell if they can be manipulated towards the infernal. Understandably, the Church considers paganism to be a diabolic threat.

Hell is not a remote force in Mythic Europe. Demons ruin crops, cause back pains, make the wind howl, and manipulate emotions. Some theologians suggest that it is impossible to drop a needle from the roof of a house without hitting an invisible demon in pursuit of a plan of evil.

### Infernal Areas

Infernal areas are among the most vile places in the world. Growth of natural plants is stunted and warped. Decay and the stench of ill humors abound. Predatory animals kill, not for survival, but for the pleasure of inflicting pain. Most earthbound demons, and many diabolists, prefer to remain in such areas. They are also typical sites for diabolic churches and covens, and for the summoning of demons. The “Areas of Infernal Power” chart gives an idea of the strengths of the infernal aura in various locations.

Travelers in or near infernal areas often find themselves in foul moods. Outlaws on nearby roads act in particularly harsh fashion—the effects of demonic influence in high concentration. Old wounds, especially those received through malevolence, hurt anew. Old conflicts and personality clashes are remembered again, and possibly reenacted. Of greater concern to magi, infernal auras interfere with the use of magic.
