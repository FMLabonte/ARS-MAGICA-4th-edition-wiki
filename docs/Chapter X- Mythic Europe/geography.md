# Geography

You will recognize many of the lands of Mythic Europe as the names of countries today. However, do not be deceived by the similarity, for in Mythic Europe the modern nation-state has not yet come to be. Where the modern nation typically has a government that rules a people with a common language and ethnic background, medieval "states" are confusing and heterogeneous. In theory, most of the rulers of Europe owe allegiance to the Pope, in a temporal as well as a spiritual sense. In turn, lesser rulers owe fealty to the great monarchs. In practice, things are changing constantly: kings defy popes and emperors, barons revolt against their overlords, and often one noble owes loyalty to two overlords—and has to choose sides when war breaks out between them.

Bloodlines and raw military power, not elections or popularity, determine succession; marriages among the nobility and royalty are usually matters of politics, not romance. (One courtly writer, Andreas Capellanus, went so far as to assert that marriage and romantic love were fundamentally incompatible.) Through inheritance, conquest, and colonization it is not unusual for a land's ruler not to speak the local language, or for two or more vernacular tongues to live side by side (plus, of course, the Latin spoken by the clergy and the educated in much of Europe).

Consider the kings of England. William, Duke of Normandy, was a vassal of the king of France—and frequently his opponent in battle. As a Norman, he was descended from Viking invaders. William conquered England in 1066, and installed his loyal, French-speaking Norman followers as lords over its lands. The marriage of the future Henry II to Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152 gave the Norman kings control over more of France than the French king had (Henry was already Duke of Normandy and soon to be Count of Anjou and Maine). Henry's sons fought against him and each other, and the wily French king Philip Augustus played one against the other to his own advantage. England's Richard I, obsessed with the Third Crusade and his interminable wars on the continent, scarcely set foot in England. Only with the decline of their French holdings do the English kings begin to think of themselves as English kings first, and continental European lords second.

## The British Isles

### Hibernia

At the western edge of the known world lies the island of Hibernia, also known as Ireland or (in the native Gaelic language) Éire. It is a green land, blessed with mild winters and ample rain, covered with deep forests and bogs.

Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales, 1146-1223) has written two books about Ireland, based on his travels there. He observes that on the fringes of the world, Nature tolerates fantastic things, and Ireland is surely a land rich with magic and wonders. Gerald reports fish with gold teeth, creatures part animal and part human, and stranger things. He also relates wonders of the saints, of which Hibernia has no lack. This wild land keeps some of the greatest monasteries and most pious monks in all of Christendom.

On paper, Hibernia is ruled by the English king. Anglo-Welsh knights led by Richard FitzGilbert de Clare—better known as Strongbow—came to the island in 1169, at the behest of Dermot Mac Murrough, who had been driven from his kingdom of Leinster. In 1213, Pope Innocent III granted Hibernia to King John as a papal fief. The pope's pro

### Scotland

Scotland is a wild country—in its land, its people, and its reputation. In popular tales on the continent, Scotland is a land so forsaken that even the Romans did not want it. A Breton princess of the 12th century said she'd rather marry any French vassal, however humble, than be queen of Scotland.

A mix of people inhabit Scotland: waves of invaders and settlers, from ancient Picts to Celts from Hibernia, to Germanic migrants and Viking raiders. More recently Norman and Flemish knights have come to serve the Scottish kings. In the Highlands and the outer isles the predominant tongue is Gaelic, and the people are known as savage and proud (and oft rumored to be pagan). Along the coasts and in the lowlands, Anglo-Saxon dialects are more common.

The king of Scots is Alexander II. He has continued the efforts of his predecessors to make Scotland a feudal monarchy, though the highland clans are most resistant to this project. In the lowlands, many of the lairds who owe fealty to Alexander also hold lands as vassals of the king of England, a situation that can generate tension and conflicts.

### Wales

Wales is not well known to most of Europe, and its inhabitants are thought to be pagans. It is a poor country whose people constantly struggle to stay just ahead of starvation, even burning earth for heat. Wales is composed of several kingdoms that war continually; practically the only thing all Welsh agree on is that they dislike the English more than one another.

The countryside is mountainous, bordered on three sides by the sea. The valleys experience mild winters and moderate summers, with plenty of rain, but in the high mountains, temperatures are much cooler and the winters can be quite severe.

### England

England forms the largest part of the British Isles. In the north are the Pennines, a ridge of high, angular hills separated by deep, flat-bottomed valleys. The eastern slopes are gentle, while the western ones are steep and harsh. To the south are the flat Lowlands, and the eastern edge of the island is very marshy. The weather is generally cool, with moderate winters and summers. There is considerable rainfall: the amount varies seasonally, and is most heavy in the winter.

Much of the country of the English has been tamed to farming, and it is a fertile and productive land. The forests that still linger, though, are the refuge of all manner of beasts, both fantastic and mundane, driven from their ancient homes.

The English kings are descended from the Normans, themselves of Viking stock, and they are much attached to the taking of land. England is currently ruled by King Henry III, considered a vast improvement over the previous king, John, who was seen as tyrannical and foolish. The English political landscape is unique. On the one hand, since the Norman Conquest of 1066, the monarchs have been undisputed overlords of the country. On the other, the nobility and general population has been bolstered by the concessions granted by King John in the Magna Charta of 1215. An English identity is emerging with the blending of Norman and Anglo-Saxon, and the creation of an independent landed gentry out of the two.

Between England and France lies the English Channel, a strait of sea that a clear day may allow sight across. However, it is often plagued with storms. One story claims that a knight who set out to cross it by boat was blown back to his starting place thirty days later, never having gained the other side.

## Western Europe

### Iberia

The Iberian peninsula projects from the southwest of France far into the great ocean. There, south of Toulouse and Aquitaine, lie the Christian kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Navarre, and the Catalan districts surrounding Barcelona. The kingdom of Portugal hugs the west coast, having recently conquered land formerly held by the Moors.

On the southern third of the peninsula is the former Caliphate of Cordoba (called Andalusia by the Christians), a Moorish land of learning and culture. The Christian states to the north are slowly but surely pushing back the Moors, who once controlled most of Iberia, in a long-running crusade known as the Reconquista (Reconquest). Skirmishes break out frequently on the border, and the traveler is advised to be wary.

#### Aragon and Catalonia

A twelfth century marriage united these lands under a single crown. The present ruler, James, is a mere boy of twelve. History will name him "the Conqueror" for his future wars against the Moors.

These lands are a collage of cultures and peoples. Moorish influence remains strong, as do the ideals of Provençal culture to the north. Settlers have come from as far away as England to populate land reclaimed by Christendom. To encourage settlement, peasants in these lands have been granted more liberty than their counterparts in many other lands enjoy.

The military orders are a powerful force here, in politics and war as well as spirituality and the Church. The Knights Templar, in particular, have a great deal of influence over young James.

### Barcelona
Barcelona is the leading city of Catalonia. Situated on the eastern coast, it carries on great trade with the Italian merchant cities and all over the Mediterranean. Barcelona is home to many Jews, who are accepted as citizens but dwell in their own separate quarter of the city.

#### Castile
Across the western part of the peninsula, along the border with Portugal, is the kingdom of Castile. This land is a bitter enemy of the Moors and the most proudly Christian kingdom in Iberia, second perhaps only to Portugal in devotion. Castile has contempt for Aragon and its tolerance for Jews and Moors. It may be only the Muslims themselves, who still hold southern Spain, that keep the two kingdoms from going to war.

#### Navarre
This small Spanish kingdom on the northern coast is constrained on the west by Castile, on the east by the Pyrenees mountains, and on the south by Aragon. Because its location is relatively unimportant to trade and military pursuits, Navarre is a poor nation. Its king is more interested in French affairs and English dealings in Aquitaine than in the Reconquista to the south.

#### Portugal
Portugal hugs the west coast of Iberia, and is in excellent position to control trade through the Strait of Gibraltar. Lisbon, the capital, was captured in 1147 from the Moors by King Alfonso I, with the help of English and German crusaders; it provides a fine natural harbor at the mouth of the Tagus River. The city is protected on land by miles of walls and at sea by valiant Portuguese sailors. In the south, the Knights of Aviz guard the border, and may be considering forays south against the Moorish city of Silves.

#### Muslim Spain
The Moorish holdings in Spain formerly constituted the Caliphate of Cordoba, but this collapsed in the early 11th century, leaving a collection of small Muslim kingdoms called *tai'fas*. This area is now occupied by the Almohads of North Africa. Its great city, on the southern coast, is Granada of the Thousand Wonders. More riches and marvels are to be found here than anywhere else, with a Palace of Ambassadors whose apartments are fitted in the style of every land.

The cities of Moorish Spain hold great schools and libraries where Christians, Moors, and Jews alike teach and learn. There are gardens said to be magical miniatures of each country and clime, and a menagerie of creatures from the ends of the earth. As well, there is an island reserved solely for the use of falconers; legends tell of griffins trained there for the hunt.

## France
France of the 13th century is not a unified country. In Brittany, a rocky land jutting out into the Atlantic, you can still hear the Breton language passed down from the ancient Gauls. Along the English Channel is Normandy, home to the ancestors of the king of England. South of Normandy are the lands of the count of Anjou. To the east is Blois, ruled by the Count of Champagne, then the Île de France, the personal domain of the king. There, astride the River Seine, lies Paris, which many consider to be the greatest city in all the West. Champagne lies north and east of the king's lands, and Burgundy south and east. Both are ruled by counts rich with the wealth brought by their vineyards.

Southern France, called Occitania or the Languedoc, has its own distinct language (Provençal) and culture. It has as many ties of language, culture, and feudal obligations with Aragon and Catalonia as it does with the rest of France. This is the land of troubadours, the inventors of courtly love; it is also home to the Cathar heresy. Provençal culture no longer flourishes as it did in the last century, for the land is oppressed by war: a crusade called against the Cathars and the nobles who gave them shelter. Knights and armies from the north of France have laid waste to the land, sacking towns and putting their inhabitants to the sword. The crusaders are inspired by the promise of salvation for this service to the Church, and the hope to become the new masters of this land. The Count of Toulouse, Amaury de Montfort, is now a northerner; his late father Simon was granted the title and lands by the pope for launching the crusade. Some say the crusade has gone too far, but the bloodletting continues.

The king of France, Philip Augustus, claims to be liege over all of these lands, and spends much of his time fighting wars to back up that claim. He has been quite successful; at the turn of the 13th century he secured the territories of Anjou, Normandy, Touraine, Maine and Poitou from King John of England, shattering the patrimony built by the iron fist of Henry II. Aquitaine remains an English fief. Philip stands to gain handsomely from the crusade in the south, as his subjects are the majority of the crusaders. The old king of Aragon was killed coming to aid of his Provençal vassals against the army of Simon de Montfort; now a mere boy sits on the Aragonese throne, and is scarcely able to press his feudal interests over the war-torn region.

### Flanders
To the northeast of France lies the county of Flanders, on the coast of the North Sea. Though small and visited by most terrible winters, it is the richest land in Christendom, for here is made the fine wool cloth that adorns lords and ladies from Granada to Constantinople. It is said the master craftsmen of Flanders can make anything, from the miniature lands of Cordoba's gardens to musical instruments that play by themselves.

The Count of Flanders is a vassal of the French king.
