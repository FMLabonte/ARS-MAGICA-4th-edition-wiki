# The Order of Hermes

## The Art of Magic

The 8th century ushered in a time of peace, enlightenment, and the growth and preservation of magical wisdom.

### The First Tribunal

Two magi were most instrumental in the creation of the Order of Hermes. First was Bonisagus, who discovered a way to create a simple magical shield that protected one from spells (now called simply the "Parma Magica"), and began work on a universal theory of magic. The Parma Magica would permit magi to meet with little fear of being attacked, and a universal theory of magic would give them a reason to work together.

The sorceress Trianoma, apprentice to Bonisagus, made good use of the Parma Magica. Its protection permitted her to seek out wizards all across Europe. She was a gifted diplomat, well able to convince her peers of the benefits a unified Order would bring. Wizards would be guaranteed their individual freedom, but the Order provided the means by which peace could be kept among them. A unified theory of magic would allow them to share their discoveries and knowledge. Trianoma encouraged many magi to visit with Bonisagus and share what they knew with him. From Druids, for example, he learned how to create new spells at a moment's notice. This skill developed into spontaneous magic. The rudiments of ritual and formulaic magic grew from the traditions of the Roman cult of Mercury, which worked powerful magic in prolonged rituals involving many participants. Using this and other knowledge, Bonisagus developed a broadly applicable theory of magic, now known as Hermetic theory.

While Bonisagus unified the magic of the magi, Trianoma masterminded their political unification. She had brought twelve magi together who all wanted to form an order. They learned the Parma Magica, studied Bonisagus's theory of magic, wrote the Code, and named their order after the Greek god of magic, whose cult they knew to predate the Roman cult of Mercury. At Durenmar in the Black Forest in A.D. 767, the twelve magi swore to uphold the Code of Hermes, and the Order was formed.

Since these magi could work together and share what they learned, they grew quickly in power. They realized that with the power of magic in their hands, the only other mortals they needed to fear were other magi. Systematically they sought other wizards out and offered them membership in the newly reformed order. All they asked was for the wizards to abide by the simple Code of Hermes and to allow themselves to be adopted into one of the houses that had been formed.

## Houses of Hermes

Members of the Order of Hermes are divided into twelve houses. Each House is a mystical lineage, and each house (with the exception of Ex Miscellanea) can trace its ancestry back to the founding of the Order. Membership in a given house is usually passed from master to apprentice, though some houses offer membership to outsiders who can pass a certain set of criteria. Each House is described in the Character Creation chapter, on pages 21-26. For a great deal of additional information on each house, refer to the Ars Magica supplement *Houses of Hermes*.

Understanding the twelve houses is fundamental to understanding the Order of Hermes, for each house has its own traditions, organizations, and breed of magus. Although the houses are far from monolithic, they are very important in shaping the prejudices, philosophies, and motivations of their members. After his covenant, a magus's next loyalty is usually to his house.

## Crises in the Order

### The Domination of House Tremere

In the 9th century, House Tremere, through skillful use of certámen and political intrigue, nearly dominated the Order, ruling several tribunals and continually growing in power. Tremere, who was still alive and masterminding the attempt to control the Order, was finally stopped by a group of unidentified magi who broke the minds of his chief lieutenants. No one knows who was responsible for "the Sundering," as this attack is called. After this event, other magi were more watchful of political events and more eager to improve their ability at certámen.

### The Corruption of House Tytalus

Near the end of the 10th century, the prima and several other leaders of House Tytalus were found to be diabolists. They had been engaged in a campaign of corrupting magi of other houses. Amid much fear and accusation, they were tried and executed. This corruption of powerful magi increased the Order's fear of devils and added to the suspicion that had developed among magi. Some mark this event as a precursor to the Schism War.

### The Schism War

Just after the turn of the millennium, open conflict broke out within the Order, a prolonged series of skirmishes, battles, and assassinations that have come to be known as the Schism War.

Some houses and magi wanted to restrict the interaction among the houses so that corruption in one House would not lead to the downfall of others. The corruption of House Tytalus was, no doubt, the main cause for this paranoia, but intrigue, competition, and skirmishing in general added to the atmosphere of distrust. Differences of opinion turned into frequent Wizard Wars and raids.

The confusion led to a free-for-all, and old feuds came alive. Sides shifted continually, and fighting took many lives. Some houses retreated to avoid the violence, while others increased their violent activities to deter attackers or just to pursue personal grudges amid the chaos. The quaesitores lost effective power as the magi stopped obeying their orders, and it looked to most as if the Order of Hermes was about to fall.

Then House Tremere declared war on House Diedne. House Diedne, composed of descendants of the Druids, had always been distant from the other houses, and it was generally distrusted. Tremere's primus, Cercistum, called on House Flambeau to help rid the Order of these troublemakers and their exotic traditions. The Flambeau magi joined in the battle with relish. The quaesitores, seeing a chance to regain power, backed House Tremere and declared House Diedne renounced. Most of the other houses retreated for safety, but many individual magi with grudges to settle joined the assault.

House Diedne was entirely eliminated, but its leaders were never found. The magi of the day hoped that the far-reaching spells they had used had killed them, but many suspected that the leaders of House Diedne had retreated into a faerie forest. If that is the case, they might return at any time, bent on revenge.

With House Diedne destroyed, the Schism War was over. The quaesitores insisted on settling all remaining conflicts peacefully, and most magi were eager to stop fighting once they had seen the destruction that can result from an all-out war among the magi.

## The Code of Hermes

All magi swear to uphold the Code of Hermes, just as Bonisagus did at the founding of the Order. All of the traditions, laws, and rules of the Order originate with the Code. The punishment for breaking the Code is proscribed within it—death—but in practice, magi usually agree to lesser penalties, especially when the violations are of the Peripheral Code rather than the Code proper. Nevertheless, when an infraction warrants death, a Wizards' March is called. Upon declaration of the Wizards' March, the target is no longer protected by the Code, and members of the Order are called upon to find and slay the transgressor. Those participating in a magus's destruction are free to plunder his resources, so there is rarely a shortage of willing executioners.

### The Code

The Code of Hermes (also called the Hermetic Oath), first sworn by Bonisagus, can be found on the next page. Since he was the first to swear it, his name is recorded whenever it is written down. There is a slight difference between the Code that members of House Bonisagus swear and the Code that members of other houses swear. The difference is marked.

### The Peripheral Code

The Peripheral Code consists of the body of rulings made by magi in council since the beginning of the Order. Although the laws and rules of the Peripheral Code are voluminous, they are also quite important. They provide precedents and lay out precisely what magi may and may not do. Questions about familiars, apprentices, the formation of covenants, exactly how magi may relate with mundane powers, how Wizard War may be waged, and the like are all covered in one form or another.

## Wizard War

The Code allows for a conflict between two magi to escalate to open conflict in certain conditions. When those conditions are met, the two magi involved may step outside the bounds of the Code temporarily to settle their differences. One magus initiates a Wizard War by sending a declaration of war to the other. The message must arrive on the next night of the full moon. The war then begins on the rise of the following full moon, and lasts until the rise of the next full moon after that.

Unjust or constant use of Wizard War is discouraged by the majority of level-headed magi. Occasionally, those who declare war too often find themselves victims of a Wizards' March.

## Tribunals

Tribunal was initially a term reserved only for what is now known as the Grand Tribunal—the first and original tribunal of the Order. Now, however, it refers to any one of the thirteen different officially recognized and regularly held councils of the Order, as well as the specific geographic areas over which these council meetings hold sway. Each tribunal holds council every seven years, settling disputes between magi and covenants, and dealing with other pressing business.

### Tribunal Geography

The Hibernian Tribunal, which consists of Hibernia and some nearby islands, is a small tribunal at the edge of Christendom. The land is wild and magical, and most magi live in isolation from the population of the land. Nevertheless, because of the relatively small size of the tribunal, a great percentage of the magi in the tribunal are involved in tribunal politics.

The Loch Leglean Tribunal covers Scotland and the northern islands. This area is also highly mystical, and has the distinction that the local populace is generally more accepting of magi than folk are elsewhere. The majority of magi here are of House Ex Miscellanea. A great wealth of information about the Loch Leglean Tribunal can be found in the Ars Magica supplement *Lion of the North*.

The Stonehenge Tribunal covers England and Wales. The domus magna of House Ex Miscellanea, Cad Gadu, is located in this tribunal. The Stonehenge Tribunal is disorganized, in part because many of the tribunal's magi live in isolation, and in part because of the rapid clearing of land and forest deprive them of the opportunity of live apart from society in magical areas.

The Iberian Tribunal covers all of the Iberian peninsula, including land currently held by the Moors. The politics of the Iberian Tribunal are chiefly concerned with the Reconquista, though there is certainly nothing that could be called agreement among the magi. At least two covenants routinely side with the Moors against the Christian forces. Although conflict is common, many covenants have a great wealth of both mundane and occult knowledge, plundered from conquered Moslem libraries and gained from Moorish scholars. You can find more information in the Ars Magica supplement *Iberia*.

The Normandy Tribunal covers France, including Burgundy and the Low Countries. It is home to Fudarus, the domus magna of House Tytalus. As the land here becomes more and more crowded with mundanes and the influence of the Dominion, the covenants of the tribunal must become more and more hidden and isolated. Remaining apart from the mundanes becomes a more difficult task with each passing year.

The Provençal Tribunal covers Languedoc, including Gascony and the Pyrenees. It contains Val-Negra, the domus magna of House Flambeau. The Provençal Tribunal is the cultural center of the Order, and perhaps its political center as well. Magi of Jerbiton are quite active here, and so relations with the mundanes are quite good. Many old and powerful covenants are found within this covenant.

The Rhine Tribunal consists of the lands of the Holy Roman Empire north of the Alps—Germany and the Rhine valley. Within its boundaries lie Durenmar, domus magna of House Bonisagus; Crintera, domus magna of House Bjornaer; and Irencillia, domus magna of House Merinita. Once the center of the Order, the Rhine Tribunal's power has decreased as the area has become more and more densely populated with time's passage. Some magi have started to involve themselves in the politics of the Empire, much to the displeasure of the quaesitores.

The Tribunal of the Greater Alps holds sway in the region around the Alps, including Bavaria. It is home to Valnastium, domus magna of House Jerbiton, and the Cave of Twisting Shadows, domus magna of House Criamon. The old covenants of this tribunal strictly enforce the status quo, allowing no new covenants to be formed within its borders. This lends the tribunal peace and stability, which its members enjoy.

The Roman Tribunal covers the southernmost portion of the Holy Roman Empire—the Papal states, the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and even has one covenant in North Africa. Harco, domus magna of House Mercere; Magvillus, domus magna of House Guernicus; and Verdi, domus magna of House Verditius are found here. This is the tribunal where magi are most involved in the world—living in cities, having political relationships with aristocrats, and selling their magical wares to mundanes. Most of the members of the Order here are quite cosmopolitan, and spend a great deal of time in the great cities. Some do not belong to covenants, or do so only in name. Relations among the covenants and magi are a nightmare mass of Byzantine political machinations. More information can be found in the Ars Magica supplement *Rome*.

The Tribunal of Thebes consists of the Byzantine Empire—Greece, Asia Minor, and the islands of the Aegean Sea. This tribunal includes the great city of Constantinople; one covenant is even found within its walls. The lands of Greece, though they fell from glory long ago, still have a great deal of magic to offer to those who live here.

The Transylvanian Tribunal consists of the kingdoms of Bulgaria and Hungary. The domus magna of House Tremere, Coeris, is found here. This area is perhaps the most magically potent of the tribunals, for the power of the Dominion is still quite weak. Although this makes the Transylvanian Tribunal one of the fastest growing in the Order, it also means that outside magical threats also abound. The Tremere have total political dominance in this tribunal.

The Tribunal of the Levant governs the magi of Christian Palestine, as well as a few covenants scattered throughout Egypt, Asia Minor, and Syria. The covenants of this tribunal have managed to find great knowledge both in the remains of earlier civilizations and in the Muslim scholars and sorcerers who live in this area.

The Novgorod Tribunal is the farthest eastern tribunal in Christendom. It consists of the Kingdom of Poland and the Russian Principalities, as well as the Nordic and Slavic lands of the North. Vast amounts of unsettled land and little competition among Hermetic magi for magical resources make this area attractive, but problems with pagan wizards and Mongols can be severe.

### The Grand Tribunal

Every 33 years, three representatives of each tribunal meet at the Grand Tribunal. Held at Durenmar, domus magna of House Bonisagus, those present discuss matters before the Order of Hermes as a whole. The next meeting of the Grand Tribunal will be in 1228. At such councils, the most powerful magi in the Order determine Order-wide policies and reconcile disagreements among tribunals. Intense politicking occurs, and such gatherings are certainly not for the weak-hearted.

## The Order and Society

Magi are prohibited by the Code and Peripheral Code from becoming the hirelings or vassals of mundane nobles. This provides the Order a great deal of protection from mundane affairs. The question remains, however, how exactly do magi interact with the rest of society?

### Peasants

The relationship between peasants and magi is quite simple. Most peasants fear magi and all things magical, and thus go within shouting distance of a covenant only if a dire emergency occurs and they have nowhere else to go. For the most part, magi find this a desirable circumstance, as they are not bothered as they immerse themselves in their arcane experiments. On the other hand, it does present some problems. It makes grogs hard to find, and food hard to come by. It also makes magi the convenient targets of blame for misfortunes ranging from dysentery to drought.

Magi are able to overcome most of these problems in part by fostering a relationship with those peasants who live near their covenants. Magi often provide services for the peasantry in return for food and service, and this arrangement can lend itself to other forms of cooperation. In areas where a covenant has stood for quite some time, relations between the magi and peasants can be almost friendly.

Peasants who are outcasts from society have little to lose from consorting with magi, as long as they can overcome their fear of the magical. Convicts often find sanctuary in the homes of magi, as few are brave enough to follow them there. Likewise, those who are ill or crippled may throw themselves on the mercy of magi, hoping to be cured of their ailments. In return, they offer their lifelong service.

### The Church

There is a very complex relationship between magi and those who represent the Church. Although many clergy think in very simple terms that "thou shall not suffer a witch to live," others who are well educated know that there is nothing diabolic in the magi of the Order. Such clergy often enjoy having philosophical discussions with magi at a level that most people can't comprehend. Of course, some magi are Christian themselves. They participate in all the ceremonies of the Church, and in this sense, magi and the clergy are allies against diabolic forces. Many clerics, however, cling to the belief that all magic is either from God or Satan, and those magi who are obviously not holy must be destroyed. Some go so far as to condemn the entire Order as Satanic.

The Church, of course, is involved in all sorts of mundane affairs—the Reconquista, the Crusades, the various heresies—and although assisting the Church does not violate the prohibition against working for mundanes, most magi would prefer to let study and experimentation occupy their time. Of course, some magi have fought in the Crusades and reconquest, much to the delight of the clergy. As long as some magi continue to help the Church, those who do not will probably simply be ignored.

### The Hermetic Oath

“I, Bonisagus, hereby swear my everlasting loyalty to the Order of Hermes and its members.

“I will not deprive nor attempt to deprive any member of the Order of his magical power. I will not slay nor attempt to slay any member of the Order, except in justly executed and formally declared Wizards’ War. I hereby understand that Wizards’ War is an open conflict between two magi who may slay each other without breaking this oath, and that should I be slain in a Wizards’ War, no retribution shall fall on he who slays me.

“I will abide by the decisions made by fair vote at tribunal. I will have one vote at tribunal, and I will use it prudently. I will respect as equal the votes of all others at tribunal.

“I will not endanger the Order through my actions. Nor will I interfere with the affairs of mundanes and thereby bring ruin on my sodales. I will not deal with devils, lest I imperil my soul and the souls of my sodales as well. I will not molest the faeries, lest their vengeance catch my sodales also.

“I will not use magic to scry upon members of the Order of Hermes, nor shall I use it to peer into their affairs.

“I will train apprentices who will swear to this Code, and should any of them turn against the Order and my sodales, I shall be the first to strike them down and bring them to justice. No apprentice of mine shall be called a magus until he first swears to uphold this Code.

*

“I request that should I break this oath, I be cast out of the Order. If I am cast out the Order, I ask my sodales to find me and slay me, that my life not continue in degradation and infamy.

“The enemies of the Order are my enemies. The friends of the Order are my friends. The allies of the Order are my allies. Let us work together as one and grow hale and strong.

“This oath I hereby swear on the third day of Pisces, in the nine hundred and fiftieth year of Aries. Woe to they who try to tempt me to break this oath, and woe to me if I succumb to the temptation.”

* At this point, followers of Bonisagus recite: “I shall further the knowledge of the Order and share with its members all that I find in my search for wisdom and power.” Others recite: “I concede to Bonisagus the right to take my apprentice if he should find my apprentice valuable to him in his studies.” The Peripheral Code extends Bonisagus’s right to claim apprentices to followers of Bonisagus.

## Nobility

Nobles usually want magi to aid them in their wars and intrigues—precisely what is forbidden. But often, nobles cultivate friendships with local magi and covenants in return for minor favors. Doing favors for friends does not necessarily violate the Code, but doing so may anger other magi or mundanes.

Followers of Jerbiton who are of noble descent may still feel loyalty to their families and traditional allies, and may even feel that they are bound by oaths of fealty. Some attempt to maintain their lives as nobility alongside their lives as members of the Order. Again, they face problems from magi who feel that the Order should be isolated.

Many covenants are located near or within the lands of nobles. Usually, magi seek to have pleasant relations with such people, as a wrathful enemy can be a threat to even a powerful covenant, and retaliation can quickly escalate into open warfare. Most often, covenants and nobles politely ignore each other, but some develop policies of mutual aid in times of crisis.

## Cities

The Order is of two minds about cities. Some magi are quite interested in them, finding that in cities they can interact with great minds, purchase supplies that are of use to them, and find items of great worth. On the other hand, many magi resent the intrusion of the Dominion that cities often bring, and distrust mundanes in small groups, much less in large masses.

As is understandable, those who don't care for city life shun it, and those who are so inclined take up city life. Many magi of the Roman Tribunal have abandoned covenant life altogether, and live happily in various cities in Italy. Some magi even teach at universities.

## Magical Items

There was a time when magi could sell magical artifacts to mundanes without restriction. That period was ended in 1061 by a treaty which regulates the sale of such devices. Under the provisions of the treaty, magi may only accept money for arcane services from consortes. Consortes, therefore, must act as go-betweens to other mundanes. The treaty also stipulates that any magic sold must eventually wear out and lose its power.

## Other Wizards

There are many in Mythic Europe who practice magic of one form or another, but are not members of the Order of Hermes. Alchemists, amulet-makers, hedge wizards, and fortune-tellers are largely ignored, even if they have actual magical powers, because they usually have limited power and no greater ambition than comfortable survival.

Some hedge wizards, on the other hand, have greater ambitions, and will work in the court of the most important noble they can impress. As long as they act discreetly, the Order usually leaves them alone. If, on the other hand, such magicians are obviously powerful and indiscreet, they are usually invited to join the Order and abandon their demeaning position. Those who decline the offer are killed.
