# Northern and Central Europe

## Denmark
This is the land of Vikings. The Danes have a long and proud history as warriors, and left their mark throughout France and England (many of the Normans originally came from Danish stock); even in the days of Charlemagne, before they had converted to Christianity, their ferocity was dreaded by the civilized nations. The land is generally cold and chilly, with frequent rains in every season except summer, and heavy snows in the winter. King Waldemar II of Denmark has recently taken advantage of the chaos within the Holy Roman Empire (during the succession of Frederick II, who was challenged by German princes), expanding his borders to the south and east along the Baltic coast.

### Malmö
A new city, founded in 1203 by Hanseatic League shippers, Malmö is a small but growing town with a moderately good harbor. Many of the inhabitants are Germans who were contracted to build the town and harbor facilities the Hanseatic merchants need to trade with the Swedes to the north. The wooden church in Malmö burned to the ground during its dedication ceremony in 1207. It has been rebuilt of stone but continually develops cracks in the walls, making it unsafe for services.

## Scandinavia
North of Denmark, across the straits, lie the lands of Scandinavia, some populated by Christians, some by pagans, and some by God alone knows what. The magi of this land follow an unknown tradition. There are tales that in the farthest of the Scandinavian lands are beings of human appearance but inhuman nature—folk who ride the wind and do not know the hearts or shapes of animals. It is also said that the wild lands harbor a great number of dragons, especially of a sort without legs or wings, like poisonous black worms.

## The Holy Roman Empire
Sprawling across central Europe is an empire that claims the legacy of Imperial Rome as its own. Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor, rules over a cacaphony of languages, lands, and peoples. This is truly an empire, not a nation. Though Frederick was crowned by the pope, the supreme pontiff is probably his greatest political rival now. In 1220, Frederick has just returned from Germany to Italy; as ruler of Sicily and the southern portion of the Italian peninsula, he has the Papal States encircled, and there is much consternation in Rome on this account.

Sicilian-bred Frederick has made his court the most cosmopolitan in Europe. He has welcomed Islamic scholars, Hermetic magi, astrologers, and travelers from strange and distant lands. He is known to keep exotic and magical animals. Churchmen regard Frederick with wariness, if not hostility; some say he is the Antichrist, and repeat rumors of strange experiments he and his servants perform on humans. The Order of Hermes, meanwhile, regards him as the most friendly of Europe's monarchs.

## Italy
Neither politics nor language unites the Italian peninsula in the 13th century. In mountainous regions feudal lords still rule their private domains; independent merchant city-republics battle one another over land and trade; and the Holy Roman Emperor plots to subject the whole land to his personal rule. The Italian language is only coming to be, as each community speaks its own dialect.

### Northern City-States
Between the Alpine borders of the Holy Roman Empire and the papal lands of Central Italy lie the regions of Lombardy and Tuscany, and the extraordinary city-states of northern Italy. Here live the richest and most successful merchants of Mythic Europe.

Genoa, with her face to the west, and Venice, looking east to the Adriatic, are the greatest; between them lie such cities as Milan, Florence, Pisa and Siena. The cities are remarkable in politics as well as wealth and trade. With the Treaty of Constance in 1183, they won recognition of their independence. Now they vie with one another, and take sides in the struggles between pope and emperor.

Heresy flourishes in northern Italy, goaded on by the voluptuousness of the Church and her antagonism with the Empire. The Church would like to stamp out the heretics, but a crusade (like the one devastating the Languedoc in southern France) would do untold damage to the region—and the independent strength of northern Italy is one of Rome's strongest walls against imperial aggression.

### Papal States
In theory the great monarchs of Europe owe fealty to Pope Honorius III as temporal liege as well as spiritual father. In practice the pope is just another player in the fractured politics of the continent.

The pope's rule is very tangible, however, in the middle lands of Italy, known as the Papal States. Saint Peter's Patrimony is the name for a strip of territory along the coast by Rome, property of the Church since the earliest days. Additional territories, crossing the Appenines (Italy's mountainous spine) and encompassing the Adriatic coast from Ravenna to Ancona, were added to the papal possessions over the centuries, bestowed by kings and emperors.

Most magi of the Order avoid the Papal States, for the obvious reasons that the Dominion is powerful here and there is little love for magi in the stronghold of the Church. But, since the magical past of Rome runs deep (it was the birthplace of the Cult of Mercury, ancestor to the Order of Hermes), there are unknown treasures to be found by those brave or foolish enough to seek them.

### Sicily and Southern Italy
Sicily and southern Italy are a crossroads of Mediterranean cultures. The blood and dreams of a dozen races populate the land, from ancient Greeks and Romans to the more recent Arab and Norman conquerors. In Palermo you will find Greek, Latin and Arabic spoken all around, as well as Norman French and Italian dialects. Saracens and Normans were both tolerant rulers, content to let their Christian, Jewish and Muslim subjects cleave to their beliefs and practices. This tolerance continues under the Emperor Frederick II, who inherited the Norman possessions and was raised in Palermo.
