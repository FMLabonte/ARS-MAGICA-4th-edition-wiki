# Eastern Europe

## Poland and the Eastern Baltic Sea
The lands extending between the Carpathian Mountains and the Baltic Sea are not well known to scholars in the west; it is surely a wild land of monsters and pagans. Some Hermetic scholars have learned of these lands and peoples from the chronicle recently written by Wincenty Kadlubek—"Master Vincent," a sometime student at the Sorbonne in Paris, currently the bishop of Kraków. Otherwise, western European books about the region are typically several centuries out of date.

Athanasius the Bald of Jerbiton, a magus who spends most of his time traveling or writing about his travels, identifies two distinct peoples in this region, according to their languages: the Slavs (related to the Slavs of southeastern Europe and Russia) and the Balts.

The great Slavic kingdom here is Poland. Their king of centuries ago, Krak, defeated the Dragon of the Vistula and so established their claim on this land. Today the greatest Polish prince is Leszek Bialy (Leszek the White, of Sanomierz). However, Poland in 1220 is in a period of fragmentation and strife, with many feuding nobles, each with his own *gród* (fortress) and retinue of warriors. A warrior caste is emerging; each *rycerz*, or knight, is a lesser noble with adequate land and income to arm himself and be able to fight in the service of his liege.

Poland is sparsely populated at this time, a situation only made worse by wars among the princes. Some lords, such as Henryk the Bearded, prince of Silesia, have appealed for settlers from other lands (particularly Germany), offering them land and special treatment in the villages they settle. Henryk's aim is to settle 10,000 new families. Many Germans have settled in cities, which often have two common names—one German, one Slavic. Jews are also common to the cities, and they are treated with more tolerance here than in many other countries. Slavery is still widely practiced, but the Church is trying to end it.

The Balts, who populate the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and the cold northern forests, cleave to their ancient pagan ways and defiantly resist conversion to Christianity. German knights, back from the crusades, have spoken of bringing them the Cross by means of the Sword, should the words of missionaries fail to be persuasive.

## Hungary
The Magyar people, led by their Prince Árpád, crossed the Carpathian Mountains and settled the fertile valley of the Danube late in the ninth century. Árpád's descendants, among them saints and great warriors, are the kings of Hungary. King Béla III, who ruled from 1173 to 1196, reconquered territories from the Byzantines and ruled with strength.

Béla's successors, Emery (ruled 1196-1204) and now Andrew II, have been less successful monarchs. Andrew has become unpopular, and troubles plague the land. Discontented nobles and clergy complain of high taxes, too many arrests, and royal confiscation of property. Counterfeit money has become a major problem, too. That is especially hurtful, since the Danube is one of Europe's great trade routes—and Buda, the largest city in the kingdom, is on the river. Some Hungarians nobles and powerful clergy know of the Magna Charta agreed to by King John of England, and they would like a similar covenant to lay out the rights and duties of the free peoples of Hungary.

Hungarian stories preserve the memories of the Magyar homeland, in distant Siberia, and the kindred tribes left behind when Árpád's people journeyed to the west. Some Hungarian clergy dream of finding their ancestral land and distant brethren who share their language, to bring them the Good News of Christianity.

## Serbia
A relatively new country, Serbia has ties to both East and West. Stephen II was made king in 1217 by the pope, but since most of the clergy and peasantry of the land is Orthodox, he was crowned a second time according to those rites. The nobility is currently adopting Western standards, and many once-free peasants are now being reduced to serfs.

The free city of Ragusa on the Adriatic coast is in Serb territory, an independent city-state and a thorn in the side of King Stephen. He is trying to gain control of the city, which is being threatened by the despot of Epirus and is appealing to the powerful merchants of Venice for protection.

## Bulgarian Empire
This empire, ruled by the ambitious and iron-fisted Ivan II, is an ally of the Byzantine emperor in Nicaea and is constantly skirmishing with the Latin states to the south, as well as Hungary. In 1204, the Bulgars took Belgrade and some Hungarian territory for themselves, and are currently claiming lands on all borders. The Slavic Bulgars and the Magyars of Hungary have a mutual history of war that goes back to when the Magyars were a migratory heathen tribe.

The city of Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria, and sits on a major trade route between Hungary and Constantinople. Cattle drives pass through here, and the stockyards to the west of the city are a gathering place for the Bulgarian army before major campaigns.

## Russia
The fragmentation of Russia began after the death of Yaroslav in 1054, as his sons divided the domain he had ruled from Kiev. The land is now divided into feuding principalities. Chief amongst them are Kiev in the south and the Republic of Novgorod in the north. Novgorod, which achieved complete independence from Kiev in 1136, is ruled by a Grand Prince and an assembly of citizens. It is stretching eastward to the Urals, settling new lands, building great monasteries such as Archangel and establishing profitable trade routes (especially for fur).

Between Kiev and the Black Sea are the lands of the Polovtsi, Asiatic nomads who have challenged the Russian princes in the past. To the east and southeast lurks a greater danger: the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan, who have nearly reached the eastern shores of the Black Sea and will soon threaten the gates of Europe.

## The East and the Levant

### Latin Empires

The former Byzantine Empire has fallen along with its capital, Constantinople, which was sacked in 1204 by the lords of the Fourth Crusade. Its vast territory has been divided, with Henry of Flanders now the emperor of the new Latin territory of Romania.

Latin Greece has been divided up into the principality of Achaea, including the duchy of Athens, while the regions of Thrace and Thessaly now form the kingdom of Thessalonica. Western Greece, though, is still Byzantine, ruled by the despot of Epirus. Venice has control of most of the former Byzantine ports and of the island of Crete, as well as three-eighths of Constantinople itself.

### Constantinople

This once-great city is now languishing under the Latin conquerors, most of its treasures having been looted to adorn the buildings of Venice. Many buildings lie abandoned, but few people are willing to relocate there after the depredations of Baldwin (though Henry is proving to be a more humane ruler). It is still a center of commerce, however, and commands the straits between the Aegean Sea to the south and the Black Sea to the north.

### Nicaean Empire

Following the fall of Constantinople, the Byzantine emperor made Nicaea the seat of the now-reduced empire. After enduring attacks from both the Latins and the Seljuk Turks, he made an alliance with the Bulgars, diverting Latin attention to the north. This allowed him to triumph over the Seljuks and to stabilize his borders. He has been pursuing the Latins ever since, slowly whittling down their holdings in Asia Minor to a thin strip of the coast opposite Constantinople.

Nicaea is a crossroads city, and many strangers from far-off lands mingle in the streets: Saracen ambassadors, Asiatic warriors, Kievan traders, Latin knights, Genoese merchants, and others. As a result, Nicaea is a cosmopolitan center of culture and government in Asia Minor.

### The Levant (Holy Land)

The lands of the Levant are hilly and dry. Winds are mainly from the south and southeast, carrying little rain to this desert region; in the summer, the blazing sirocco is like a blast from a red-hot stove. There is little vegetation, and the primary crops are olives, cedar, and citrus fruits. This land is populated mostly by Muslims and Jews, although the number of Christians is growing.

#### The Crusader Kingdoms

Formed by the lords of the First Crusade, these originally comprised four states: the kingdom of Jerusalem, the principality of Antioch, and the counties of Tripoli and Edessa. Edessa was retaken by the Saracens later in the series of crusades, and Jerusalem fell to Saladin in 1187, followed by Antioch. Antioch and some of the coast were recaptured in the Third Crusade, but Jerusalem remains under Muslim control.

#### Jerusalem

This is the most holy city of Judaism and Christianity, as well as an important religious site for Islam. It is the site of the Holy Sepulcher, where the body of Christ lay for three days, and once housed the True Cross. The city is currently in Saracen hands, having been recaptured from the crusaders by Saladin after the Battle of Hattin. Most of the time, Muslims do not harm Christian pilgrims who come here to worship at the holy sites.

## Beyond Mythic Europe

### The Far South

Beyond Spain and the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea lie the lands of the Moors. Europeans are unfamiliar with their ways and tell stories of kings who are magicians, hunting lions and dwelling in palaces without walls; of a land that is entirely under the rule of the Sun; of knights who breed all manner of wild animals for the greater glory of their king and their god.

#### Prester John

It is said that somewhere south or east of the Moorish lands is a Christian kingdom whose ruler is known as Prester John. His lands are the finest in the world, having rivers that run with rubies and hyacinths, and gigantic ants that mine gold from the earth. He, and the hermits who live in his kingdom's towers of stone, are rumored to know the location of Paradise, but angels guard the entrance and no one may pass. Around it, the legends say, grow trees whose fruit cures all sickness, madness, and despair, no matter how caused; this wondrous fruit may even heal ailments that are otherwise incurable.

### The Far East

Far to the east of the Russian principalities, say legends, there are forests too deep for a rider on horseback to pass through. They are reputedly inhabited by pagans and faeries, wild men riding winged horses, and witches with walking huts. Even the most common sorts of beasts are supernatural, and the peasants know no difference between magical and natural things. Beyond that is the mysterious land of Cathay, home of silks and spices, where dragons are said to abound and mysterious sorcerers practice unknown magics.

### The Atlantic and the West

Beyond Hibernia lie the Isles of the West, unnumbered and scattered on the unforgiving sea. Some, it is said, are rootless and move about like beasts, first to one place, then another, and cannot be charted. Sail farther west and you may come to the wild vineyards of Arcadia. Sail too far north, though, and you might find a place where the sun never rises and the sea is living ice that devours ships.

## Mythic Europeans

### The Three Classes

In the Middle Ages, European society was divided into three great classes of people: those who toil, those who pray, and those who war. Each class was supposed to be blessed by God, and worthy of salvation on its own terms. An implicit contract among the three kept each in its place, providing important services for the others. The same holds true in Mythic Europe.

#### Those Who Toil

The first of the great classes is the peasantry. A peasant's purpose is to provide the basic needs of life for everyone else,

so that the clergy are free to deal with God, and the nobles are free to fight their wars. Even though this work makes everyone else's achievements possible, it is considered the most ignoble of tasks, allotted to the most inferior of humanity. Disease, malnutrition, crop failure, and heavy taxation are the peasant's usual lot.

The upper classes believe that God created their stations and filled them with appropriate people. Thus, gratitude to the laboring class is not a consideration. Just as God decrees a person's social position, so too does He restrict its members: inequality is ordained.

The peasant is bound to his or her superiors by a social contract: "If you fight to keep me safe, I'll feed you. If you do your best to save my soul, I'll feed you." However, peasants have rights as well as responsibilities. They have the same chance of salvation as cardinal or king, and therefore have the same access to the blessings of the Church: baptism, consecration, last rites, and Christian burial. They also are entitled to decent treatment and full protection from their superiors, though what they actually get depends on the mercy of their lord and the allegiances of the local clergy.

Needless to say, the rights of the peasants are not always observed. However, for the upper classes to break the contract is to invite the peasantry to do the same. Every time a noble tramples the fields on a hunt, or ravages the countryside in a needless war, the peasants take note. Every time a parish priest breaks his oath of chastity, or a mendicant order buys cloth-of-gold, the peasants remember. The prospect of a peasant revolt haunts every abusive noble and hypocritical cleric, though in truth, most peasants are very loyal to their lords.

#### Those Who Pray

The second great class of people in Mythic Europe is the clergy. The social bargain demands they do the work of mind and spirit. In earlier times, saving souls was their only purpose, but over time, priests, monks, and nuns assumed other important tasks.

The first of these is to control and administer the social order. God created society, they argue, so God's representatives should run it. When peasants seek to overreach their limits, parish priests remind them that their lot is God's will. When nobles fight each other in useless wars, the bishops chasten them with their divinely ordained responsibility to protect the land against invaders, not neighbors. Disobedient kings are reminded that they rule by the will of God, which is known only to the pope.

The second task is to manage thinking. Excessive thought is dangerous for those not assigned to it; it makes them aware of the injustices of life, which can lead to social turmoil. Peasants are supposed to be good farmers. Nobles are supposed to be good warriors. Neither group should have to think any more than necessary—it's not their job. Saracens, pagans, Jews, and magi are doubly damned, for their thoughts are not only blasphemous, but in defiance of God's order.

A few clergy are so certain of their righteousness that they defy temporal laws, establishing their own "divinely sanctioned" order. By putting a price on absolution from sin, popes take bribes to assure a peaceful afterlife. Cardinals, abbots, and abbesses scheme for political power and control of lands. How long such practices are accepted depends upon the moral outrage of society, or of the few who have power to intimidate the priestly class.

The clergy are divided by an internal war, one which has been brewing for some time. On one side are those who believe their first task is the most important; they are the defenders of order, the enforcers of orthodoxy. When this means restraining mad nobles or rooting out diabolists, these clergy accept the task and are considered heroes. Sometimes, though, this requires excommunicating a noble with a new idea or suppressing magi, even benevolent ones. In such cases, these clergy are seen as oppressors.

On the other side of the struggle are those who seek knowledge above all else. They are frequently the attackers of orthodoxy, and fight the bigotry that too often arises with the emergence of anything new and different. For these clergy, "It's God's will" is no answer to any injustice. They say God made people with the power to think for themselves. Such ideas run the constant risk of being labeled heresy.

#### Those Who War

The third great class is the nobility. Their job is to protect society and maintain order. Every noble has an ancestor who was a barbarian chief, whom the common people supported in return for the power of the leader's sword. These ancient warriors passed their station down to their descendants, including the right to bear arms and to be supported by the common people, and the obligation to protect commoners in return.

Every noble wealthy and powerful enough to own a large tract of land keeps a house there to store the arms, armor, animals, and equipment of war. In the early days, when war was a constant feature of life, the noble house was little more than a stone fort. Now nobles demonstrate their power in grand manors and castles, with walled gardens and high turrets that dominate the landscape.

The peasants whom the lord protects live close enough to the castle walls that they may take refuge within if danger threatens. Civilization exists only within the shelter of the lord's household and sword. Ironically, the nobility maintains its tyranny by protecting the rights of lesser people.

## The Feudal System

### Warlords, Vassals and Lieges

Practically all warriors are nobles, from the duke who owns the largest lands to the poor knight who defends a baron's single keep. Nobles who own vast lands usually require help in defending them. The more land and peasants a lord has, the more warriors he or she can attract, and the better castles he or she can build. This in turn allows the lord to defeat more powerful lords in battle, and thereby gain more lands, castles and warriors. This is how great lords achieve their status.

Seizing territory from a neighboring lord, however, is a dangerous gamble. If the opponent is more powerful, the attacker might lose holdings instead. Even a victorious lord might be too weak from one battle to fight the greater war that had been the true goal, or to fend off the attacks of a third party. After a thousand bloody clashes, someone found a better way. In exchange for being granted lordship over a piece of a greater noble's land, a lesser noble agrees to fight for the greater in his wars.

The greater lord contracts for the services of the lesser in a solemn and holy ritual, passing a clod of fertile earth into the hands of the lesser. He or she is then bound forever by the gift of land. The lesser lord places his or her hands between those of the greater and swears an oath of fealty: the greater is now liege to the lesser, who is vassal to the greater. A lord who controls large areas of land, and owes fealty to no greater lord (except perhaps the Emperor or the Pope), is a king or queen.

Vassals owe their lords a certain number of days of service in war each year (usually 60). They in turn can have vassals of their own, a chain ending with the lowliest landless knight, who swears fealty just for the essentials of life and the hope of being granted a little land someday as a reward for exceptional service.

### Pages and Squires

Nobles may be born, but warriors are made. By the age of seven or eight, a young noble is already a fighter-in-training. Such children are taken from their mothers and fathers and sent into a greater noble's house. They spend the next seven years as pages, learning to ride and fight, as well as serving the lord. As servants of the castle, pages also learn the courtly graces from the ladies of the household.

Between eight and twelve years of age, a page becomes a squire and now learns from a single knight. A squire earns the office of knight only after proving a mastery of the arts of war, and in any case, no earlier than age 21. What rank the knight attains after achieving that honor depends on his inherited position in the hierarchy of nobles, or what fortune he may wrest from the world. (Many of the knights fighting in the crusade in 1220 are younger sons who hope to carve their own holdings out of the Saracen lands.)

### Inheritance

The system of inheritance can be complex, and varies from land to land: sometimes only the eldest son gets all of a lord's holdings (this system is called primogeniture), sometimes other relatives take pieces, and sometimes there's a war and everything goes to another noble. Although title usually passes to male children, a noblewoman may inherit lands if she has the luck, courage, and political acumen to survive the succession. In this case, she inherits the family's titles, rights, and powers.

Since most noblewomen are not trained in the ways of war, one who fails to inherit lands usually can't win her own by impressing a lord with swordplay. If she is not an heir, a noblewoman's title and position come from her husband; she is lord over no lands and cannot have vassals. She can settle for simply being a good wife and mother, or she can exert power behind the throne of her husband. However, she may make an outright bid for her husband's lands if he's away for an extended time, or if he dies leaving no heir or one who is too young to fight.

Female lords can be formidable, for while their brothers were learning swordplay, they were becoming skilled in the arts of diplomacy and conversation, reading and writing, and foreign languages. By the law, however, noblewomen have the right to lead armies and go on crusades.

### The Drive to Adventure

Many nobles have grown bored with their lot in life, now that the age of barbarian invasions is over. Though many nobles are content to slip into a useless life, some are unwilling to succumb to decadence. Doughty knights, in the flower of their youth, choose instead to venture into the far lands to the north or east. For them, the hunger for adventure is unquenchable; without dragons to hunt, crusades to fight, heathen lands to convert, and infernal taints to cleanse, there is no reason to live.

## The Church

### The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy

The pope is the vicar of Christ on Earth, second only to the powers of Heaven. Next come the cardinals, who elect a new pope, usually one of their own, when the old one dies. Archbishops are the chief clerics of large and important lands, while bishops are the chief clerics of cities. Below the bishops are the vast numbers of ordinary priests, whose station varies according to the size and prestige of the church and lands they serve, and according to whether they run the church themselves or assist a higher cleric.

While piety and faith protect many of the clergy from the power of the Devil, they are often the primary targets for temptation and corruption. The soul of a cleric may be harder to obtain than that of a commoner, but it is worth far more for its potential to corrupt a whole parish. The most attractive targets among this holy flock are those country priests too ignorant and unlettered to read the Mass, much less save a soul, and those bishops and cardinals who would rather fight wars and plot political intrigue than pray.

### Monastic Orders

Monks and nuns are bound by a great oath to follow the Rule of their holy order, a set of sacred laws set forth by its founder. Rules are different for different orders, and monks and nuns wear robes and hoods of varied patterns, sober blacks, or shades of brown and white, to show which order they belong to.

Some orders accept only men; some take both men and women. Every order is based on similar ideals: prayer observed throughout the day and night; withdrawal from the evils of the world; and celibacy. Generally monks and nuns live in separate institutions, though there is a lot of gossip about what goes on behind the walls.

These orders often hold their own lands, some as extensive as those of dukes and earls; the lord of a monastery or convent is called an abbot or an abbess. Those who have forsaken the sins of the world are holier than the most pious lay person and the most powerful archbishop alike. Monks and nuns answer only to their abbot or abbess. Because many monasteries are extremely wealthy, after generations of gifts and bequests and the profitable labor of the brethren within, abbots and abbesses have to deal with many temporal concerns, from political relations with the local nobles to rivalry with other monasteries and the meddling of bishops.

As true monks or nuns are the holiest of all people, so are false ones the most debased. Their souls are highly prized by the servants of the Dark One. While most live in pious chastity, an unholy few lie on silk sheets, eat foods as rich as those enjoyed by any king, keep lovers, and sometimes even deal with infernal powers. Lecherous and luxury-loving monks and nuns are the subject of a thousand jokes and as many tales of horror.

### Lay Clergy

For some, to be a lay cleric is the first step on the road to God. For others, it is a refuge from an inhospitable world, without the strict discipline of religious life. The vast majority of students, of whom more is said later, are lay clergy and hence beyond the reach of civil law. Most lay clergy are happy to stay as they are, free to live in the temporal world and subject only to the gentler laws of God. The worst of them are corrupt, licentious, and irreligious, caring only for the freedom their status gives them.

Lay clerics include the following, described in ascending order of seniority.

- Doorkeepers: The lowest order, they guard the entrances to holy places.
- Readers: These clergy write and teach, joining the everyday world with that of the Church.
- Exorcists: Such people are specialists in casting out of demons and in holy cures.
- Acolytes: Closest to holy orders, these clergy minister at the altar.

### Cathars

The hypocrisy of many in the Church invites heresy. One of the most influential heresies in 1220 lays claim to the holiness of monastic life, but renounces the sloth and corruption so often found in the holy orders. These Cathars, or Albigenses (named for the town of Albi, where they flourished), believe that any peasant can be as holy as an abbot or cardinal simply by living in the hermit's fashion, away from the sins of the world. The holy men and women who have given up worldly cares are called perfecti. They rail against pope and monk alike, denounce the sacred rituals of Mother Church, and even invested their own bishops and clergy.

The Cathars threaten the very foundations of the social order, yet their true faith and their charges of corruption cannot be denied. From their sanctuaries, like the inaccessible mountaintop castle of Montségur, powerful orators sway the populace; in some places they practically rule the countryside. For decades there has been debate within the Church as to whether they should be brought back into the holy fold by gentle and reasoned persuasion or burned as tools of the Devil.

The latter course of action has been chosen. The pope sanctioned a Crusade, led by Simon de Montfort, which continues to ravage the once rich land and culture of southern France. One bishop epitomized the crusaders' virulence by declaring that they should simply kill all the inhabitants of a town, orthodox and heretic alike; in the judgement after death, God would know his own.

## The Commoners' Lot

### Serfs

The first peasants to become serfs gave control of their lives and their land to a warrior, striking a bargain to exchange their labor for safety. In the evil days after the fall of Rome, Vikings, howling barbarians, and ravenous hordes from fallen cities roamed most of Europe, destroying all they met. Those who accepted serfdom saved their land and their lives by their bargain.

Serfs are not quite slaves, since they are bound to the land rather than a person, though their lord claims ownership of their work and its products. Serfs must give the lord goods in exchange for living on and farming the land they surrendered; it is an indentured servitude whose term never ends. They must also farm the lord's land before their own, and must provide labor for the lord's building projects, wars, and household. However, serfs cannot be bought, sold, or killed without legal justification.

Serfs' bodies are their own, but their deeds are not. They must care for themselves, as well or as poorly as they can, with what their lord allows them. For every act outside the ordinary bounds of their work, they must have their lord's blessing. Serfs who break the rules are dead serfs. On the other hand, lords who lawlessly destroy those they are bound by tradition to protect, or who raise their serfs' obligations above traditional levels, can be punished by their overlord.

#### Free Peasants

Free peasants are bound to no one. They, or their ancestors, may be former serfs who have been freed. In some extraordinary circumstances, such people's ancestors never became serfs. Free peasants have the right to do whatever they please whenever they want to, with only two restrictions: they must not take on the privileges of their betters; and they must, each year, pay rent to the lord of the land they farm—or be sent packing.

Like serfs, free peasants have a contract to care for their landlord, as well as his or her lands and household, in exchange for protection. Unlike serfs, though, free peasants can choose to risk starvation by doing as they please. Freedom is no less cherished when its profits are not tangible.

### The Peasants' Contribution

Most of the world's great works came from commoners' hands. Free peasants built London and Paris, and bought the cities' right to self-rule in the same way they bought their own freedom. The knight's proud sword came from the blacksmith's forge in the humble village at the foot of the castle. Barbers, lawyers, artists, craftspeople, and city guards are all peasants. The great cathedrals, monuments to the glory of God, were fashioned by toiling masons. The gold of kings was acquired by the clever minds and skilled hands of merchants and weavers, vintners and tradespeople.

Many among the noble class of the time deeply resent peasant wealth and power, when the power of their own land and sword is fading. Yet most peasants remain farmers, scraping a living together by the toil of their hands and the sweat of their brows. Even those who dwell in towns usually keep fields and flocks just outside the city walls. Short lives, high rents, and heavy taxes keep most peasants at the bottom of society. Thus, though peasants in theory have the ability to rise above their current social position, that transcendence is still centuries away.

## Cities

### Rise of the Medieval City

For centuries after the fall of Rome, the only settlements in northern Europe were tiny villages clustered close to the castles of the nobles, hiding from the barbarians, Vikings, and others who sought to destroy order and peace. Over time, as the barbarians were driven off or civilized, merchants began to travel the newly safe roads once again, trade fairs sprang up outside many of the larger castles, and some free peasants began to return to the long-deserted cities.

Taxing the fairs often brought a noble more silver and gold than extracting meager payments from overburdened peasants. So, in return for the greater profit gained from a permanent center of trade, some nobles granted the inhabitants of trading towns the right to freedom and self-government. Others were forced to do so when angry townspeople took up arms against oppressive taxation. Whatever the reason, lords usually signed charters with the inhabitants of towns, promising the townspeople certain rights in return for taxes.

From these humble beginnings many independent towns and cities were born. Now, in 1220, there are hundreds of towns of more than 1,000 inhabitants: London has about 25,000; Paris and Genoa boast over 50,000; Milan and Venice, jewel of the southern seas, have 100,000 residents. Still, none can rival Constantinople, with its population of more than half a million.

### Perils of Freedom

In the city, no one is lord or serf. A peasant who lives within the walls of a city for a year and a day is free, and cannot be called out to fight in one of the lord's wars. All citizens have the right to marry, move, and inherit property as they please.

Of course, too much freedom breeds anarchy and chaos, while the wealth of merchants invites the attention of thieves. To avert that danger, town councils are formed from the wealthy and knowledgeable heads of trade and commerce. These worthies levy taxes and tolls and make the laws, which are enforced by the town guard and the courts.

Many who visit a city or town for the first time are surprised at how crowded and closed in the place is. The reason for this is obvious: defense. Just as a castle and its keep protect a noble lord, the walls of a city defend it against bandits, war, or overly ambitious nobles. Of course, the walls breed crowding, filth, theft, darkness, fire, and even pestilence. Despite the risks, many townsfolk are rich in power, pride, and material goods.

### Roads

The major cities of Mythic Europe are linked with one another and with towns, castles, and monasteries, by roads. Some roads are better than others ranging from simple tracks to grand roads built by the Romans centuries ago. Where roads meet cities there are gates which are usually closed at sundown. Such gates often provide revenue to the city, as people entering are forced to pay a toll. Of course, gates also serve to keep out attackers and undesirables.

Just outside the gates, along the roads, are the pitiful shacks and decaying hovels of the very poor. Hospitals are also found here, little more than shacks themselves, run by the clergy for weary and injured travelers. Also outside the walls there are wretched shelters for lepers and other unfortunates.

### City Streets

Once inside the gates, the picture changes completely. The roads become the city's major streets and are well maintained, with solid cobbles, ditches for waste, and only a little mud. People travel on foot and on horseback, the very wealthy ride in litters, and wagon drivers haul goods. Side streets wind about between the buildings, from which garbage and other matter rains down intermittently. They are filled with people and their pack mules, geese, dogs, cats, and whatever vermin can survive.

To enable more people to live in a large city, many buildings have two, three, or even four stories. The upper levels often extend out, overhanging the lower ones and nearly touching across the street, to give more space inside the house. As a result, light is dim on the back ways, even on the brightest day.

### Work and Play

#### Markets

Living in the city is convenient, for one can purchase supplies readily. Ready-cooked food is available at market squares, taverns, and inns. Ingredients for cooking at home are also sold at the markets. Vendors sell different kinds of produce on different days: butter, poultry, meat, milk, fish, and herbs from the countryside. Craftsmen in town produce goods, like cloth and leather, in their shops and sell them at the markets.

#### Fairs

Fairs are held every month or so during the mild seasons of the year, and outshine even the busiest market days. Most fairs take place on important holidays, and usually last for eight days. At these times, the city truly comes to life. Plays and pageants are put on by the various guilds for the amusement and religious instruction of the public. Entertainers come from far away to perform mimes and puppet shows, and to play music and sing.

Merchants who have been to far-off cities come to sell their wares, and perhaps tell tales of places few ever see. Hedge wizards attend fairs to sell charms and other items, while alchemists set up their velvet pavilions and cater to the wealthy. Often magi, in the company of their retainers, come to these fairs to purchase mysterious objects, or simply to enjoy the mundane pleasures of the city.

#### Building Projects

There is plenty of construction work in cities, despite the limited space. Sometimes workers are expanding the walls; at other times, they execute special or lengthy projects, such as cathedrals. Traveling work gangs move from town to town, helping to erect large buildings. Because construction can take so long, these "itinerant" workers can become, for all practical purposes, citizens of a city.

## Guilds

Trade and commerce are the lifeblood of towns, and guilds govern these important enterprises. Merchant guilds regulate the behavior of traveling traders, also serving as a mutual aid association against the dangers of the road. Most townsfolk are more familiar with the craft guilds, which include everyone from humble cobblers to wealthy goldsmiths.

Craft guilds insure all members produce work of adequate quality for fair and uniform prices. No member can work longer hours or employ more apprentices than any other, nor advertise his or her wares to the detriment of another member. After all, unfair competition breeds dissent, and dissent breeds poverty for all. Guilds also provide aid to members who are sick, and funeral expenses and support to the families of members who die.

Cities offer opportunity for all who can work in an honorable profession, including women. Wives and daughters can join the guild of their husbands and fathers, and widows often inherit their husband's business and position. Many guilds admit all women of good character as members, and a few, such as those for spinning and block printing, employ only women.

### Advancement

The system provided by the guilds is generally fair and good. A youth is apprentice to a master, and works for room, board, and education during the years necessary to learn the craft. After learning the basics, the apprentice becomes a journeyman. Journeymen must still work for a master, but are paid for their labors.

After spending enough years to fully master the craft, a journeyman may petition the guild council for full membership. To do so, he or she usually must create a "masterpiece" to demonstrate his or her skill, and present it to the guild. If the work is judged acceptable, the journeyman swears an oath to uphold the guild, and becomes a master. He or she then has the right to sit on the guild council, work for whomever he or she will, and take on apprentices. In this way the guild assures all masters are fully conversant with their chosen craft.

### Education

Cities are also centers of learning. Well-to-do children of all social classes are taught the basics of reading by their parish priest, and almost everyone gets some instruction in religion. Church schools can also provide some of the basics of a formal education. Even though books are hard to come by, and written by hand, many people of substance own a few.

This is the age of the university: the most important cities, such as Paris and Oxford, have one. Students generally study for three years, after which they take examinations. Each who passes becomes a baccalaureus, who can then assist in teaching. After three more years of study such assistants become masters. Both men and women can be students and masters in most universities. Law, medicine, theology, history, rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic are the subjects commonly studied.

Though classes may be held in rented buildings or even in rough sheds, no one has greater pride than the educated. Students and their masters are part of a guild, much like the craft guilds. Students who attend the university of their home town are its champions, living together and challenging rivals as a group.

As long as they pay their tuition, students are responsible only to their masters, who in turn answer only to the Church. Students often flaunt their unique freedom and mock the nobility by going about armed with daggers and swords. Indeed, the reputation of students as lewd, irreverent, drunken, and rowdy is often well deserved. It is no surprise that nobles and students often come to blows.

## Money

What modern people think of as money, whether it be coins, bills, or any other abstract form, is a convenience rather than a necessity. If all money suddenly vanished off the face of the world, a lot of people would be angry, but the basics of life could continue. True wealth is measured in solid goods of value.

The basic unit of value is land. Land provides food, clothing, and shelter; without it, you would die. For that reason, only those who are crazy or truly desperate will sell it. Instead, people barter items of value whose worth depends on the land's bounty, such as grain and livestock. However, these are not easily exchanged physically, and require that there be a significant surplus on hand. Therefore, a symbol of the exchange—money—replaces the actual goods. Gold and silver coins make the ideal currency: precious metal is portable and for the most part without practical use.

### Coins

Many peasants in Mythic Europe live out their lives without ever using a coin. Anyone dealing with poor people may have to barter in goods of like value: a meal, a dozen eggs, a yard of cloth, or perhaps a special service from a craftsperson. Establishments that regularly serve travelers have special arrangements, since their goods or services are usually costly enough to necessitate payment in coins. In cities, coins are more common, and every town has merchants whose business involves dealing with them.

Unlike modern currency, medieval coins don't identify their own value. Each is a piece of precious metal that is printed with the mark of the lord or cleric that had it made, as well as with some identifying image. The mark signifies the weight of the coin and the percentage of pure gold or silver in the metal. The fancy picture keeps it from being counterfeited, and offers the wealth and fame of the coiner as a guarantee of authenticity.

It is always in the best interests of a lord to make his or her own coins, if people will accept them as good. That way, the lord knows those coins, at least, represent a known quantity in payment. However, the personal fame of the lord counts for much. People are generally much more willing to accept the coins of the king of France than they are those of the count of Toulouse.

### Paper Money

Paper money of a sort does exist in the Middle Ages, in the form of checks. A noble can write a letter of indebtedness to a banking house or to another person and sign it, creating an easily transported voucher that can be redeemed on demand for its value in gold or silver. A deed of ownership of land can fulfill the same function.

An endorsed check has additional signatures (endorsements) of rich and influential people. In theory, their signatures vouch for the check-writer's honesty; in practice, if the original writer doesn't honor the debt, the endorser has to come up with the cash. Obviously, the best checks are the ones endorsed by an archbishop or a monarch.
