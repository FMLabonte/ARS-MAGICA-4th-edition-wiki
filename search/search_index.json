I am William, called of York for I was born in that city, and I am an oblate at the monastery of Rievaulx. I came into this world of suffering in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and eighty six, and it pleased God to take my mother to Him at my birth. In my eighth year my father died, and my uncle gave me as an oblate to the monastery, where I have lived since. I shall take my vows as a monk next Easter, and never leave the monastery thereafter.</p> <p>I was given the book in which I record my life by Fulk of C\u00eeteaux, a monk of our Order. He has visited this monastery many times, and is much in conference with the abbot. He has shown a great interest in me, and I do not believe Geoffrey's suggestion that his interest stems from a mortal sin. I believe that Geoffrey will be a bad monk and bring scandal to our Order, but God alone shall judge.</p> <p>The abbot gave Fulk permission to grant me this book, and required that I obey his command to record my life. The monastic day is unchanging as the eternal God is unchanging: we pray seven times per day, as the psalmist says, and pass our other time in labor and study of the Holy Bible. There is great wisdom in such simplicity, as St. Bernard says.</p> <p>I, William, write this with my own hand. Adelard wrote the above with my help. I wanted the opening of this book to not be marred by my poor Latin.</p> <p>The third day of Advent, in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and ninety nine.</p> <p>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, and Ailred of blessed memory.</p> <p>Fulk of C\u00eeteaux visited the monastery today, and the abbot summoned me to a conversation with him. He wanted to read my book, and I brought it to him. He asked me many questions about my studies, and my life as a monk. He seemed happy, but I do not understand what he wanted.</p> <p>The Feast of the Circumcision, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.</p> <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, blessed Bernard, and Ailred of holy memory have mercy upon me and guard my soul.</p> <p>I have left the monastery. Fulk of C\u00eeteaux, who is neither Fulk nor of C\u00eeteaux, came for me and took me away. I am sitting by the fire in a camp, surrounded by men of war, and Julia who is Fulk is watching me write from the other side of the fire. I would leave, but I have nowhere to go. Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison.</p> <p>I shall tell the story of these days calmly. Fulk who is Julia came to the monastery on the Feast of the Innocents. He went to see the abbot, and I was summoned to speak to them again. Fulk asked me more questions, and then stared at me as if he could look into my soul. Perhaps he could. When I returned to the novices they were all whispering about me, and Geoffrey said wicked things about Fulk. His imagination fell far short of the truth.</p> <p>Yesterday I was summoned again to the abbot, and Fulk was with him once more. The abbot seemed distracted, and told me that I was to leave the monastery and go with Fulk to his home. I was shocked, because the abbot has always preached firmly that monks must stay in their monasteries. I began to protest, but he stopped me, telling me that I was sworn to obedience. I left, but it was not true. I have not taken my vows yet. I could have disobeyed him and remained. Instead I left.</p> <p>Fulk spoke to me before I left the abbot, and told me that we would leave before dawn. I own nothing, and so brought nothing but my clothes and this book. Fulk met me in the cloister, and we left in the half dark. Fulk quickly led me away from the road, and I heard voices ahead, and saw a camp fire. Fulk led me to the top of a hill, and stood between me and the rising sun.</p> <p>\"Watch and learn,\" he said, \"for this is your destiny.\" I faced the old man, dressed in the plain white habit of the Cistercians, and for a moment nothing happened. As the sun rose above the horizon, a darkness spread through his robes, and through his hair, his skin became fair, and his body changed, and I thought that a demon had surely possessed him. Perhaps it had. The white habit of a monk became rich robes of deepest blue, decorated with shining silver, and I was frozen to the spot as ice seemed to clutch at my heart. The old man was gone, and a beautiful woman stood before me. The silence of that moment seemed to last forever, as she seemed to gather the disappearing darkness into herself.</p> <p>\"I am Julia, follower of Jerbiton, and I am your mistress.\" The words broke whatever spell held me there, and I turned to flee back to the monastery, but men from the camp had climbed up behind us, and one of them caught me.</p> <p>We walked all day, the warriors guarding me so that I could not flee, and Julia leading the way. We camped shortly before sunset, and I watched carefully to see if she would change back. She did not, only performing some ritual. Now, she watches me across the flames, and I see my soul in hell, watching her through the flames for eternity. Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.</p> <p>The Feast of Epiphany, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.</p> <p>May our Lord Jesus Christ protect me, the Blessed Virgin Mary send angels to guard me, and Ailred of holy memory intercede for me, for I am in the den of vipers, yea, the very house of robbers.</p> <p>I am sitting in my room, which is lit by a fire which never goes out. The worm which never perishes will come for me when I sleep, for this is an unholy place, surely cut off from the love of God.</p> <p>It does not look like the mouth of Hell. It is a stone manor house, well built around three sides of a courtyard, the fourth side closed by a wall with a gate in it. Two towers rise from the rear corners, and there are people busy within it. It even looks something like a monastery, but without a chapel. There is no chapel, and no church in the village. Truly, all those here are lost, and I am among them.</p> <p>When we arrived it was clear that Julia had come home, for everyone rushed around to make her welcome. She sent a servant to summon a council, and led me to a large chamber in the rear of the house. In this room stood a large table, round like Arthur's, and she sat in a chair finer even than the abbot's, with her name carved on the back. She told me to stand behind her and keep silent. As I waited, the others came.</p> <p>The first was a man, small and thin, dressed in robes of deep red, the color of blood. He brought with him a smell of burning, and there was ash on his hands. The second was another woman, taller than Julia, and very pale, dressed entirely in white. Her cheeks and forehead were covered with scars in an intricate pattern, as were her hands. In one hand she held a dagger which glittered like ice, and she toyed with it throughout the council. They had entered through the door by which we had come, and I was sure then that I was in a house of demons.</p> <p>Then a bird, a raven, flew in through one of the windows and settled on another chair. In a moment it had changed to a man, small, with dark hair, who sat naked in the seat, staring at me with hungry eyes.</p> <p>One chair remained empty, and I fixed my eyes on it to avoid looking at the others, who were talking in Latin, too quietly for me to follow. As I watched, the final councilor appeared in the chair, appearing from nothing amid a stench of rotting flesh. He was robed in rough brown, and his face had the pallor of a corpse. I was about to run, but Julia had seized my wrist, and I found that I could not move. She spoke to the assembly.</p> <p>\"Sodales, this is William of York, my new apprentice. He is under my protection.\" I am sure that the raven looked disappointed at that.</p> <p>Then I was sent from the room, and guarded by two of the soldiers who had come with us from the monastery, until Julia emerged to lead me to my room. And now I sit here, and dare not sleep. Oh lord, save me from this place.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20I-%20Introduction/extracts-from-the-journal-of-antoninus-of-jerbiton-formerly-william-of-york/#the-art-of-magic","title":"The Art of Magic","text":"<p>The feast of St. Antony, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.</p> <p>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the holy Virgin Mary, and Ailred of blessed memory.</p> <p>I am still alive, and I have a friend here. Jocelin is a minstrel, and not much older than me. He lives here all winter, and for much of the rest of the year, but he also travels round England. He assures me that I will be allowed to leave.</p> <p>He came to me on the day after I arrived, and offered to show me around the place. This is the covenant Voluntas, part of the Order of Hermes. The magi, those whom I saw at the council, rule the covenant, while the consortes like Jocelin see to day to day administration and the turb does all the menial work. The magi all have private areas, which Jocelin refused to show me: he said it was too dangerous. Julia of Jerbiton, my mistress, is the most approachable of them. Kirist of Flambeau, the one in red, has a nasty temper, and can make you burn by snapping his fingers. Phessallia of Merinita, the woman in white, is cruel and cold, and I should stay away from her. Corvus the Raven of Bjornaer is just wrapped up in his own world, and doesn't like interruptions. Desiderius of Verditius is a necromancer, and would be more interested in me were I dead. I asked Jocelin where all these places \u2014 Jerbiton, Flambeau, and the rest \u2014 were, and he laughed, saying that they were not places, although they were houses. He said that Julia would explain that to me, and that he did not fully understand it.</p> <p>Jocelin took me to the kitchens, and introduced me to the head cook. She warned me about stealing from the larder, and told me that I was not a magus yet. He showed me round the dormitories, and took me to the door of the library and showed me a crack in the door. I peered in, and I was amazed. There were dozens of books, maybe more than two hundred. Jocelin told me that the library was off-limits to all but the magi, but that most covenfolk could not read, anyway. Then he took me to meet the grogs, the soldiers who had guarded me on the way here. The leader of the grogs is a woman, although I didn't realize that until she spoke. I think I was a bit rude in my confusion, but Maud just laughed and went back to training the others. Jocelin explained that the grogs were there to protect me, and were supposed to die to defend me, if necessary. I asked him why, since I was nobody important. Jocelin laughed then, and sat me down on a mounting block to explain. I will try to write down what he said.</p> <p>\"William, you have the Gift, and you are Julia's apprentice. In a few years you will be a magus, able to command the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. The winds and waves will answer to your will, and the earth itself will rise up to form your dwelling. Age will flee from your face, and flames will shrink from your body in fear. People will see what you wish them to see, and think their thoughts at your whim. The power of a king pales beside that which you may attain, and no-one but the Tribunal of the Order may judge you. You may be only an apprentice now, but everyone here respects what you will become.\"</p> <p>I wonder if he is right.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20I-%20Introduction/extracts-from-the-journal-of-antoninus-of-jerbiton-formerly-william-of-york/#the-order-of-hermes","title":"The Order of Hermes","text":"<p>Fifth day of Scorpio, thirteen hundred and thirty ninth year of Aries.</p> <p>I think I should write down what I have been taught, because I am sure that my mistress will not repeat it. She, and the other magi here, are members of the Order of Hermes, which seems to be much like the Cistercian Order to which I once belonged. It is divided into twelve Houses, of which Jerbiton is hers, and will, as her apprentice, one day be mine. The Order governs magi by the Code, which is enforced by the Quaesitores and at the Tribunals, which meet every seven years, one in each region of Europe. My mistress wants to build a Great Chamber, a new meeting place for our Tribunal, in London, because she says that the covenant of Blackthorn, as host, unduly influences the decisions. There are no abbots in this Order, and every magus has a say, so there is no-one to stand against Blackthorn\u2019s corruption.</p> <p>Covenants, like Blackthorn and Voluntas, are something like monasteries, I think. Several magi live together, sharing resources and governing themselves. Voluntas has a council of all the magi, and my mistress believes that we should build a fine new chamber for the council meetings, so that their importance is more obvious to the other magi. I think that she wants Corvus and Desiderius to regard them as more than simply distractions from work. They complain every time they are forced to leave their laboratories, even if it is only to fetch a book from the library.</p> <p>My training will last for fifteen years, and at the end of it I will be admitted to the Order, and then I shall have the same rights as my mistress, and the power that Jocelin spoke of.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20I-%20Introduction/extracts-from-the-journal-of-antoninus-of-jerbiton-formerly-william-of-york/#travels-and-the-great-chamber","title":"Travels and the Great Chamber","text":"<p>Fourth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress is going to visit another covenant, and she has decided to take Jocelin and me along. This will be the first time I have been out of the covenant since I arrived, apart from brief visits to Wilton, and Jocelin has been helping me with preparations. Henry the Tailor has made me a proper traveling cloak, and Henry the Smith has prepared me a dagger and an ax. We leave at dawn, and Jocelin is being deliberately mysterious about our destination. He won\u2019t tell me where the covenant Semitae is, telling me that I shall understand when we get there.</p> <p>Eighth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>We were attacked by brigands today. They were waiting in ambush, and the grogs had to fight them off at first, until my mistress could cast a spell. The spell, and the speech that she made after casting it, convinced them that we were important allies. They swore by the Holy Cross that they would not harm us, and then escorted us to the edge of their territory. Jocelin noted the route, and says that we will return another way. I don\u2019t see why: we dealt with them easily, but Jocelin is afraid to rely on magic too much.</p> <p>Twelfth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>We have arrived at the covenant Semitae, and I see what Jocelin meant. The covenant lives in several large wagons, and travels around the Tribunal. Their route is planned by Gerfallon of Criamon, the head of the covenant, which Jocelin says makes it nearly impossible for any sane person to track them down. My mistress is closeted with Gerfallon, but I haven\u2019t seen him (or her, I don\u2019t know) yet. Junius of Verditius, who makes the wagons, is entertaining us. They are fashioned of iron, so that a magus may have his laboratory in one, and they change the ground that they cross to make a firm road. Junius told us about his new project, which is to make a wagon that can be pulled through the sky and over the seas. He said that the main problem is the horses, and he thinks that he may have to make them as well, mundane horses not being suitable. I suggested that he just make the wagon move itself, but he didn\u2019t like that idea. Wagons do not move themselves naturally, while horses do, so it is easier to enchant a horse to move than to do the same for a wagon. There are so many things to remember when working magic.</p> <p>Thirteenth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>We have left Semitae, and my mistress is pleased with the results of our visit. I asked Jocelin why we had to walk, and he told me that most magi cannot ride horses, because the beasts hate their magic, and throw them off. I am unusual in that. He told me not to ask my mistress about it, because she is sensitive on the subject.</p> <p>Twentieth day of Virgo, thirteen hundred and forty second year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress is in a foul mood. She went to the council today to try to convince them to build the new council chamber. I have seen the plans: it is heptagonal, with a vaulted stone roof supported by a slender central pillar. It is truly beautiful, but they made her choose between that and the Great Chamber. She chose the bigger project, and made them promise to give her the money for the land next year, but she is still raging about their lack of vision.</p> <p>Ninth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>The covenant council have given my mistress the money for the land, and so we are going to London. Jocelin is coming along as well, because he knows London better than we do. My mistress has been sketching new plans all day, wondering whether she needs to buy a larger plot of land. Jocelin says that we should have some time to look around the city while she negotiates with people.</p> <p>Twenty third day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>We have arrived at London. There are so many people and houses here, and they are so big. Not as big as Rievaulx, on the whole, but large all the same, and so many of them. We are staying in an inn that Jocelin knows. We have private rooms, in return for a lot of money and a promise from Jocelin that he will perform. I don't think that I have ever actually heard him sing.</p> <p>Twenty fourth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress gave me leave to wander London today. Jocelin took me around for an hour or so, showing me how to get to the inn from St. Paul's, and where I could buy food. Then he left me. I think I lost my purse less than half an hour after that, but it is no matter. The merchants balance the thieves, and I can make as many silver pennies as I need. I watched a miracle play, which showed the martyrdom of St. Catherine, and wandered round St. Paul's, listening to people conduct business until they realized I was eavesdropping.</p> <p>Then I wandered up among the merchant houses, and met Elisabeth. She is working as a servant for one of the big houses, and was happy to go with me to an inn. I bought her wine, rather than the cheaper ale, and made sure that we were away before sunset. It's amazing what a tiny amount of magic can achieve. Perdo Mentem made her forget the time and the greetings from her friends, Creo Mentem enhanced her liking for me, and Creo Corpus made her burn with lust. Magic, and a bit of timing. The sun set while we were in flagrante delicto, so she barely noticed the magic wear off. She did hurry home as soon as we had finished, though, and I got back to the inn to discover that I had missed Jocelin's performance. Ah well.</p> <p>Twenty sixth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>Elisabeth had a young man, it seems. Quite a wealthy one, with a large number of rough friends. They sent a messenger, claiming to be from her, and like a fool I followed him. They were all waiting for me, and I couldn't affect enough of them. I don't know if they would have killed me, but Jocelin arrived, with the household guards of some noble, and they fled. He has promised not to tell my mistress, and hopes that I have learnt a lesson.</p> <p>I certainly have. I must get my mistress to teach me more Int\u00e9llego.</p> <p>First day of Cancer, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>The negotiations are complete, and my mistress holds the deeds to a large plot of land just outside the city. She has spent most of today expounding her plans for the Great Chamber, both as a masterpiece of architecture and art and as a place where all the magi of the Tribunal can meet away from the influence of Blackthorn. Apparently Semitae has also agreed to support this idea. We shall leave London tomorrow, and I still haven't heard Jocelin sing.</p> <p>Tenth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress talked to representatives of many covenants at last year's Tribunal, and now we are traveling about the country to negotiate support for the Great Chamber. She plans to form a religious order to look after it while the magi are not using it, thus giving it legitimacy while preserving our control. Personally, I doubt that many magi will want to meet in the Dominion, but she plans to portray that as a benefit: it grants additional safety to those attending Tribunal.</p> <p>We have come to the covenant Schola Pythagoranis in Cambridge. They are well-disposed to us, as House Jerbiton dominates them, but they are more interested in scholarship than art, and I think that our visit is somewhat ill-timed. They have taken advantage of the dissolution of the university at Oxford to lure the Masters and scholars here, and the town is bursting at the seams. It is strange to be in a town, and all the churches be closed. Even the round church of the Holy Sepulcher is closed, although I thought that the Templars had an exemption from the interdict. Jocelin is nervous about his immortal soul, but I told him not to worry: the faithful are not damned merely by dying during an interdict.</p> <p>We are being accommodated in one of the covenant's houses for tonight: they have buildings scattered through the town. The sancta of all the magi are in a large stone house near St. Sepulcher's, but the grogs and covenfolk live in other buildings, sometimes in single rented rooms. At least this covenant will not have any problem about meeting in the Dominion.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20I-%20Introduction/extracts-from-the-journal-of-antoninus-of-jerbiton-formerly-william-of-york/#twelfth-day-of-libra-thirteen-hundred-and-forty-seventh-year-of-aries","title":"Twelfth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.","text":"<p>We met with Edward of Milton, the Warden of the covenant, today.

As expected, they were sympathetic, but they had a request for us. The magi here do find that the Dominion interferes with their work, but they have identified a magical area in a nearby forest. Unfortunately, most of the forest is under the control of the faerie, and all attempts to construct laboratories have been thwarted. He wants us to negotiate a peace with the fay. If we succeed, he will support my mistress's plan at the next Tribunal. She agreed, of course.

This event deserves a more detailed account, however. The forest is only an hour's travel from Cambridge, and so we left shortly before dawn, my mistress preferring to deal with the faeries of the light. We arrived there a while after the sun had risen, and walked into the forest. My mistress was calling out that we wanted to speak with the ruler of this place, and the grogs were looking around nervously. I, of course, maintained my poise and dignity, as did Jocelin. He said that the fay were well known to be fond of minstrels, so he felt safe.</p> <p>After we had wandered for an hour, Guy, our woodsman, announced that we were lost, and that he could no longer make sense of the vegetation. My mistress was pleased at the news because, she said, it showed that we had entered the faerie forest. I felt a burning by my side, and realized that my knife was glowing with red heat. I plucked it from the sheath and threw it to the ground, where it melted and ran away like water. All around me, the grogs were doing the same. Poor Stephen was wearing chain mail, and we could not get it off him in time. As we stood there, completely unarmed, Jocelin said, quietly, \"I seem to remember that faeries dislike iron.\" My mistress turned on him, and seemed about to do something serious, but after a moment she relaxed.</p> <p>\"Yes, I should have thought. My apologies, lord.\" I was confused for a moment, until I followed her gaze, and saw that the faeries had arrived. Their lord was dressed in gleaming silver armor like the scales of a fish, and sat on a throne of ice, which sparkled in the sun. Beside him stood his guards, great bears in a silver livery, carrying clubs the size of young trees. At the lord's feet sat his minstrel, a tiny creature with enormously long, spindly fingers, which cradled a lute. I sensed other eyes on us, but I could see nothing.</p> <p>\"Why have you sought me out?\" the lord asked. My mistress replied.</p> <p>\"We are here on behalf of the magi of Schola Pythagoranis. They seek permission to build a laboratory on the edge of your wood.\"</p> <p>\"Why should I permit that?\" My mistress was silent, and Jocelin stepped forward, clearing his throat.</p> <p>\"Would you accept a wager for your permission?\" The faerie lord considered him, and nodded.</p> <p>\"Perhaps. What wager, and what contest?\"</p> <p>\"A singing contest, between me and your minstrel. If I win, you will allow the magi of Schola Pythagoranis to build and use laboratories in that area of your woods, for as long as they wish. If he wins, they will give up any attempt to build there.\"</p> <p>\"And you will remain here as my servant, until you die.\"</p> <p>\"Agreed.\" He said it quickly, before any of us could intervene. My mistress was pale, and went to talk to him, but he waved her away, turning his attention to tuning his lute. He looked at me over the frets and winked, and I realized that I was finally going to hear him sing.</p> <p>He struck a chord, and began. It was an old lay, the tale of a faerie maiden who enslaved human knights with her beauty, and kept them imprisoned in a cave. He sang well, and the faerie minstrel joined in. Its fingers moved like lightning over the strings, and it seemed to be playing three parts at once. It opened its mouth to sing, and three voices spilled out, the high voice of a young boy, the deep voice of a mature man, and a voice that was like the singing of birds in the dawn. My heart sank, but Jocelin only smiled, as he played a little interlude between verses. The maiden's latest victim was led into the cave, and there met the previous</p> <p>prisoners. Still the faerie minstrel seemed clearly better, and the faerie lord was grinning.</p> <p>Then the music changed. Jocelin was improvising, and changing the story. The newcomer spoke to the imprisoned knights of their homes and families, left behind desolate, and of the glory to be won on the battlefield, not in this cave. He spoke to them of the shame of being held in thrall by a woman, and roused them to action. As the knights rose to their feet and girded on their arms, preparing to leave, the faerie minstrel began to falter, losing time with Jocelin, the notes clashing.

Usually, a score in one Characteristic is added to a score in one Ability to determine how well the character performs a given task. For example, a character attempting to recall an important fact about dragons would add his score in Intelligence (a Characteristic) and his score in Legend Lore (an Ability) to generate a total that will indicate how well he can perform the remembering task.</p> <p>In most cases where characters are tested, outcomes are uncertain. The success or failure of such actions is simulated through a die roll, made at the direction of the storyguide. All die rolls in Ars Magica are made on ten-sided dice. These are marked with the numbers 0 through 9, and are available at most game and hobby stores. There are three different ways that the ten-sided die can be used in Ars Magica, and the method depends on the situation. Usually the rules will tell you which way to use the dice, but sometimes the storyguide must make the decision.</p> <p>A simple die is rolled in a situation when the variability of possible results is low and there is little likelihood of spectacular success or failure. Read the number as rolled; a 0 counts as 10.</p> <p>A quality die is useful in situations where there is a chance of extraordinary success, but no risk of devastating failure. Read the number as rolled; a 0 counts as 10. If the result is 1, you may roll the die again, doubling whatever number comes up. If a second 1 comes up, reroll and quadruple the next number; a third 1 means multiply the result by 8; and so on.</p> <p>A stress die is rolled when a character is in a critical situation. People under stress are scared and therefore give it all they've got. They are capable of extraordinary feats but can also make disastrous mistakes. Stress rolls can also be called for in situations where there is a chance of great success or abysmal failure, even if the situation is not particularly stressful. If you roll a 1 on a stress die you may roll the die again, doubling whatever number comes up, and so on, just like a quality die roll. If you initially roll a 0 on a stress die, it counts as a 0, not a 10, and you usually must check to see if you botch. To check for a botch, roll again. This second die is called a botch die. If your botch die comes up 0 your character has botched\u2014something has gone horribly wrong. Your character has failed, regardless of the final modified score of the die, and some special penalty, devised by the storyguide, generally applies. In particularly tricky situations, you may have to roll more than one botch die. Each extra 0 rolled increases the severity of your failure. Note that any result other than a 0 on a botch die is disregarded.</p> <p>No matter which way the die is rolled, the result is added to the sum of the character's Characteristic and Ability. This total sum must meet or exceed an ease factor that is either assigned by the storyguide or written out in the rulebook. The ease factor will be higher for difficult tasks, and lower for easier tasks.</p> <p>Often, modifiers other than the appropriate Characteristic and Ability will apply to a given die roll. Advantages or disadvantages are sometimes stipulated in the rules, or the storyguide may assign modifiers based on the specific situation. These modifiers should be added in to the total before comparison to the ease factor.</p> <p>For example, say that the character above was trying to remember a specific weakness of dragons. In order to remember, the storyguide says that he must beat an ease factor of 9. His Intelligence is +1 and his Legend Lore is 4. He rolls a stress die (the storyguide deems that there is a chance of a botch\u2014he could remember incorrectly and put himself in a load of jeopardy), getting a 5. His total is 10, which exceeds the ease factor. He successfully remembers the fact. Had he rolled a 0, he would have to roll a botch die to see if he had botched and remembered incorrectly.

Skills, Talents, and Knowledges are broken down further into related groups such as Arcane Skills or Formal Knowledges. Each Ability is assigned a score, representing the character's level of expertise.

Generally you will add your character's score in the appropriate Ability to your score in one Characteristic to the roll of a die. Often times, other modifiers will also apply based on the specific circumstances of the action. The Characteristic chosen depends on how the Ability is used. For example, Athletics is usually used in combination with either Stamina, Dexterity, or Quickness. In a situation where your character is attempting to leap over a chasm, you would apply your Athletics score and your Dexterity score. On the other hand, when running a foot race, you would sum your Athletics and Quickness.</p> <p>The Storyguide determines the ease of success in given tasks by assigning ease factors. When using an Ability against a static force the ease factor is based on the difficulty of the task. For example, when attempting to pick a lock, the ease factor would be based on the quality of the lock. When the attempt is opposed by another person's actions both roll and compare results. The higher total usually wins, but the storyguide must take into account any other modifiers that apply, such as Encumbrance, Virtues and Flaws, or special circumstances.</p> <p>The storyguide decides whether the roll is a stress or simple die. If your character is feeling pressured and is likely to make mistakes or do exceptionally well as a result, the roll is stress. The storyguide can also set a minimum Ability score that must be met even to attempt certain rolls.</p> <p>You may not always be aware of the reasons for rolling, the modifiers to your rolls, or the results of success or failure. In situations where your character does not know what is going on, the storyguide may simply roll on your behalf and announce the results.</p> <p>If your character attempts an action covered by an Ability that he does not have, there are three possible procedures. For Talents (except Exceptional Talents\u2014see page 59), roll a stress die modified only by the appropriate Characteristic, with three additional botch dice if you roll a 0. For Skills, you receive a -3 penalty to your stress roll as well as three extra botch rolls. Where the action requires a Knowledge, you cannot even make the attempt.

As this is a Flaw, good effects should not be generated from the Twilight encounter.</p> <p>Unimaginative Learner: You have trouble figuring things out for yourself. Subtract one from rolls when you study from raw vis (before multiplication).</p> <p>Vis Obligation: You must pay someone four pawns of vis a year, independent of any other obligation your covenant may have. Failing to pay your debt may lead to very serious consequences, such as Hermetic punishment. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Flaw based on the availability of vis in the Saga.</p> <p>Warped Magic: Your magic is accompanied by some unpleasant side effect that always manifests itself the same way, but with increasing intensity according to the level of the spell. Examples include nearby items become hot or nearby plant matter becomes shriveled and wilted. This effect may cause trouble from time to time, but is usually just annoying.</p> <p>Weak Writer: You write about magic slowly and methodically. You copy spells from your shorthand at (Scribe Latin x 10) levels per season, and copy (Scribe Latin x 30) levels of spells that have already been written out per season. You may only write summa up to one-third of your level in an Art of Knowledge, and write two levels less per season than normal.

Any spell that requires a targeting roll to aim its effect is subject to disastrous failure: a roll of 0 is automatically a botch. You receive a \u20133 penalty to any rolls involving Finesse.</p> <p>Discredited Lineage: The quaesitores suspect your Hermetic line of some terrible crime such as diabolism or descent from House Diedne, and it's unlikely that your name will ever be cleared. They keep a close eye on everything you do or say. If wrongdoing takes place, you are the first they suspect. Should you ever be formally accused, people are likely to shoot first and ask questions later. The quaesitores also try very hard to keep members of your line from positions of authority. You have a bad Reputation of an appropriate type, level 4, among quaesitores.</p> <p>Lack Of Concentration: You are profoundly unable to focus your mind. You cannot possess the Concentration Ability and cannot cast ritual spells.</p> <p>Lack Of Control: After casting a spell, you must spend a round doing nothing but recovering your mental faculties.</p> <p>Limited Magic Resistance: You are less able to resist magic than other magi. You gain no bonus from your Form scores to magic resistance rolls, though if you are caught without your Parma Magica, you retain a magic resistance of 0. You are still entitled to a natural resistance roll if it is applicable to the spell.</p> <p>Rigid Magic: You cannot use vis when you cast spells. Thus, you cannot extend the duration or range of spells, increase your spell rolls, cast ritual magic, or create permanent effects. You can use vis in the laboratory.</p> <p>Short-Lived Magic: Your spells do not last as long as they should. Spells that should be permanent last a year; those of a year, a moon; those of a moon, only to the next sunrise or sundown; and those of a sun, merely Diameter. Diameter, Concentration, and Instant spells are not affected, nor are those whose duration is enhanced by vis.</p> <p>Slow Caster: Your magic requires more time to prepare and execute than that of other magi. Your formulaic spells take two rounds to cast; spontaneous spells also take two rounds unless you fast-cast. Ritual spells are performed as normal, since all magi must cast them slowly and carefully.</p> <p>Stingy Master: Your master trained you less thoroughly than most, so you have only 130 points to buy spells and 130 points to purchase Arts instead of the usual 150 for each.</p> <p>Weak Magic: You are particularly unskilled with a certain Art, making it difficult for you to overcome the natural and magic resistance of targets. When determining Penetration with that Art, halve your spellcasting roll. In addition, the target's Natural Resistance roll is at +3.

Whenever you cast a spell, you have a difficult time stopping yourself from casting again and again until you drop from exhaustion. Whenever you use a stress die in spellcasting, you must, whether or not the spell succeeds, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll, against a target number of half the level of the spell (or, if you botched, the level you were attempting). If you fail, you must immediately either cast a Formulaic spell of at least the same level as the previous spell, or cast any spontaneous spell, expending Fatigue. If you botch, you continue casting spells until you fall unconscious.</p> <p>Old: You started your apprenticeship late in life, or were held far too long by your master. Your age is 40 + Stamina, or higher if you wish. This means you may have to make rolls on the Aging chart (without the aid of a longevity potion) before play even begins. Your first year as a magus will probably be spent in creating your longevity potion.</p> <p>Painful Magic: Casting spells causes you to suffer the equivalent of one Body level in pain for each spell you cast. This reduces all your actions by the appropriate wound penalty, which is cumulative with any from actual injuries or fatigue (though you do not suffer any physical damage from pain). You recover these \"pain levels\" just like Fatigue levels.</p> <p>Study Requirement: You are unable to study magic (including spells, Arts, and enchanted items) from books or vis alone. You must study in the presence of the appropriate Art. For example, you need to sit next to a brook or pond to study Aquam, or a large fire to study Ignem. Growing things are good for Creo, decaying ones good for Perdo. As your knowledge grows, you need to work with larger and larger quantities. This may limit your ability to learn some Arts. For example, the volcano that you need to learn Ignem 20 may be too dangerous to work near. This is up to the storyguide to decide.</p> <p>Weak Parma Magica: Your Parma Magica offers no protection under relatively common circumstances which are fairly easy for an opponent to utilize, such as when you are wet or facing away from the caster of the spell.

Whenever you enter a faerie area, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than its aura rating to avoid becoming disoriented.

This is an excellent Virtue for a beginning player, as it legitimizes any help the storyguide may give.</p> <p>Contortions: You are able to perform physical maneuvers beyond the scope of most people. Add your score in this Ability + Dexterity or Strength to any roll when attempting to break free of a hold or restraint, squeeze into a small space, or get through a small opening. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Contortions 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.</p> <p>Direction Sense: You have an uncanny ability to orient yourself and can determine which way is north by rolling Direction Sense + Perception of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Direction Sense 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.</p> <p>Dousing: You have the ability to find things beneath the earth through the use of a dousing rod (usually a forked stick) and your own intuitive sense. You concentrate on the thing to be found, hold your dousing rod out in front of you, and follow its subtle motions to the target. If you're looking for something specific, you must have an appropriate sympathetic connection to the thing sought (such as bottled water from a stream when searching for running water). Before you roll, designate the area in which you are searching\u2014if the item sought is not present in that area, you automatically fail. The time required to search depends on the size of the area, and must be invested whether you succeed or not. To find something common, like water within 25 paces, requires a Perception + Dousing of 9+. Increased distances or dousing for less common things increases the target number. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Dousing 1, which can be improved as any other Talent.</p> <p>Educated: You have been educated in a Grammar School, and may have attended a university or cathedral school. You have a score of 3 in Speak Latin and 1 in Scribe Latin, and may purchase Academic Knowledges or Skills at character generation. You are at least (18 - Int) years old. Magi may not select this virtue\u2014this sort of training is given to all starting magi.</p> <p>Empathy: You can intuitively understand the emotional needs of others and can therefore respond to them more appropriately. Add your Empathy score to rolls on appropriate Traits such as Communication and Presence. In addition, you may apply one third (rounded up) of your Empathy score to Folk Ken rolls. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Empathy 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Enduring Constitution: You can withstand pain and fatigue. Decrease the penalties for reduced Body and Fatigue levels by one point. You also get +3 on rolls to resist pain.</p> <p>Faerie Upbringing: Perhaps you were abandoned by your true kin, and the faeries found you. Maybe your family actually lived in a faerie forest, or faeries took you as a babe. Though you are now back in human society, you feel at home with and have an enhanced understanding of faeries, magic, and other strange things. You have the equivalent of the +1 Virtue Common Sense when dealing with Faerie. However, you find human society, including religion, bizarre. You cannot have Social Skills as starting Abilities, but may purchase the Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if you cannot otherwise buy Arcane Knowledges.</p> <p>Free Expression: You have the imagination and creativity needed to compose a new ballad or to paint an original picture, and have the potential to be a great artist. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to create a new work of art.</p> <p>Further Education: You have spent two years at a university or cathedral school in pursuit of higher learning. You have an additional seven experience points to spend on Academic Knowledges or Skills. This virtue may be taken multiple times. You may only take this Virtue if you already have the Educated or Magister in Artibus Virtue. In either case, your minimum age increases by two every time you take it. For example, an Educated character with Intelligence +2 who takes this virtue twice must be at least 20 years old. See Magister in Artibus on page 38.</p> <p>Good Armaments: You can start with any standard armaments and one expensive weapon or piece of armor.</p> <p>Healer: You have an empathic understanding of how to aid the wounded, the sick, and the suffering. Add one third (round up) your Healer score to any Chirurgy or Medicine roll, and to the recovery rolls of anyone you tend regularly. You can also use this Ability to calm the grieving and to soothe pain. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Healer 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Heir: You have little power or wealth now, but you stand to inherit land and possibly money. You need do nothing special to remain in your position, but others may occasionally attempt to remove you from the line of succession\u2014one way or another. When you finally win your inheritance you gain its responsibilities as well, so your freedom may be restricted.</p> <p>Herbalism: You are skilled at releasing the inherent magical properties of plants for use in potions, elixirs, pastes, and powders. Herbalism is particularly suited for some purposes, so you get bonuses when making certain kinds of substances: poisons +5, antidotes +5, healing and health +5, and hallucinogens +3. You can also identify plants, know when to harvest them, and understand their special properties. Choosing this Virtue confers the Knowledge Herbalism 1, which can be improved as any other Knowledge.</p> <p>Higher Purpose: Let others concern themselves with petty matters, you have a nobler goal. This purpose should be altruistic, like freeing an oppressed people or bringing peace between the Order of Hermes and society. You gain +3 on Personality Trait rolls made to pursue your goal.</p> <p>Indentured Servant: You have a personal attendant to cater to your everyday needs and desires. The servant generally follows your commands but is not trained to fight and is not highly skilled, having experience points in Abilities equal to his age in years. If the term of service is limited, and you want the servant to remain, you should provide some strong motivation. If your servant ever dies, or ends his service, you have no replacement.</p> <p>Inspirational: You are a stirring speaker or a heroic figure, and can urge people to great efforts. You give targets a +3 bonus to rolls for appropriate Personality Traits, and +3 to natural resistance rolls versus certain spells that affect the mind.</p> <p>Keen Vision: You can see farther and more clearly than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving sight, not including attacks with missile weapons.</p> <p>Large (companions and grogs): Your Size is +1 instead of 0. This gives you have an extra winded Fatigue level and an extra hurt Body level.</p> <p>Learn From Mistakes: You are able to improve a particular Ability through the expedient of repeated failure. The first time in a given story that you botch a roll or fail by exactly one point, you gain one experience point in the Ability. You may take this Virtue several times, once for each Ability chosen.</p> <p>Light Sleeper: You can wake up almost instantly when disturbed and can take action immediately once awake, without the usual penalties. The storyguide may also allow generous Perception rolls to see if noises wake you.</p> <p>Long-Winded: You can last longer when exerting yourself than most, and gain +3 on all your Fatigue rolls. This bonus does not apply to casting spells.</p> <p>Magic Sensitivity: You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical effects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from all natural resistance and magic resistance rolls you make. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Magic Sensitivity 1, which can be improved as Talents. When attempting to sense the magic nature of a place or object, the storyguide will assign an ease factor\u2014simply roll a simple die + Perception + Magic Sensitivity.</p> <p>Mimicry: You are able to imitate others' voices, as well as animal sounds. Mimicry is far from perfect, though, and you have to work hard to convincingly reproduce a specific person's voice: roll Mimicry + Communication of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Mimicry 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Perfect Balance: You are skilled at keeping your balance, especially on narrow ledges or tightropes. Add +6 to any roll to avoid falling or tripping.</p> <p>Premonitions: You intuitively sense whenever something is wrong, or is likely to go wrong soon. This Ability can be called upon by you or the storyguide, as appropriate, whenever there is a chance to avoid danger. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Premonitions 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Prestigious Family: Your family is well known and respected. When in dire need, others may help you because of your relatives, or your family itself may provide assistance. You begin the game with a Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who know your family.</p> <p>Rapid Convalescence: Your body can heal quickly. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to recover from wounds.</p> <p>Read Lips: You have a limited, self-taught Ability to understand the speech of people you cannot hear, simply by watching their mouths. This Ability is far from perfect, and you get many words confused: roll Read Lips + Perception of 9+ to be accurate in your interpretations. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Read Lips 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Reckless: You tend not to notice that situations are threatening. You start with a Personality Trait of Reckless +3, and can never have a positive Personality Trait reflecting care or patience. Whenever the storyguide deems it necessary for you to check bravery or a similar Personality Trait, make a roll against your Reckless score instead. A success means you do not realize your danger, and can act immediately without further checks.</p> <p>Second Sight: You are able to see ghosts, demons, and other invisible spirits. A roll of 9+ on Second Sight + Perception is usually successful, but your target may be higher or lower at the storyguide's discretion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Second Sight 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Secret Hiding Place: You know of a spot that is out of sight or just very difficult to get to, unknown to all but a few (or just yourself) and so is an excellent hiding place when you are in trouble. You may occasionally have problems getting there, but once hidden you are basically safe. However, there is always the risk that someone may find your hiding place, putting you in some kind of a predicament.</p> <p>Self-Confident: You have firm confidence in your own abilities. You begin the game with one extra Confidence point. You may take this Virtue up to three times, if you wish.</p> <p>Sense Holiness and Unholiness: You are able to feel the auras of good and evil. A Perception + Sense Holiness and Unholiness roll of 9+ lets you sense holiness or unholiness in a general area; 15+, in a person or object. In auras of particularly strong divine or infernal influence, your sensitivity may overwhelm you. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Sense Holiness and Unholiness 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Sharp Ears: You hear better than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving hearing.</p> <p>Social Contacts: You have a broad range of acquaintances in a specific social circle (specified when this Virtue is purchased), accumulated over years of travel and socializing. Almost everywhere you go, you meet someone you know, or can get in touch with someone who can help you. Whenever you are somewhere new, you can contact someone on a simple Presence roll of 6+. The storyguide may modify this target number upward for very small areas or areas where it is extremely unlikely that you would know someone. You may purchase this Virtue more than once, each time specifying a different social group.</p> <p>Strong Personality: For any three Personality Traits, you may have scores from -6 to +6 instead of the usual -3 to +3.</p> <p>Strong-Willed: You cannot easily be coerced into activities, beliefs, or feelings. You get +3 on any roll which may require strength of will.</p> <p>Tough: You can take physical punishment better than most people. You get a +3 bonus on your Soak score.</p> <p>Troupe Upbringing: You were raised among a group of entertainers, spending much of your childhood traveling from town to town. Rolls involving Performance Skills and Physical Talents in a selected area (which you should have approved by the storyguide) receive a +3 modifier. Examples might include tumbling and acrobatics, knife throwing and juggling, or storytelling and acting.</p> <p>True Friend: You have a very close friend who is your confidant, supporter, and ally in all things. The two of you do not hesitate to help the other, and you do not question each other's needs. Friendship brings obligations as well as benefits\u2014if anything bad happens to your friend, you are distraught (and, if appropriate, vengeful). You and your friend both have a Personality Trait of Loyal +3 to each other.</p> <p>Venus' Blessing: People are often attracted to you. You get +3 on Communication and Presence rolls with sexually compatible characters in appropriate situations. At times you can put this to good use. At other times it's an annoyance.</p> <p>Versatile Sleeper: You can fall asleep at will, anywhere, anytime, enjoying sleep whenever you have a few minutes. Thus, each day you get the equivalent of a full night's rest without having to spend the night in unbroken slumber. You can be awakened normally when napping.</p> <p>Veteran: You spent at least two years campaigning, perhaps on one of the Crusades. During that time, you improved your martial skills to some extent. You may spend seven experience points on Weapon Class Abilities, or any other Abilities that your storyguide approves of that you might have learned or improved while campaigning. You may take this virtue more than once.</p> <p>Weather Sense: You are in tune with the subtle nuances of the weather. On a roll of Weather Sense + Perception of 9+, you can sense what the weather will be like the next day, or sooner if conditions are rapidly changing. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Weather Sense 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Well-Known: You have a good Reputation, level 2, in a particular area near the covenant, and are generally well liked.</p> <p>Well-Traveled: You have journeyed extensively in this part of the world and find it easy to get along with people throughout the area. You are familiar with regional dialects and can pick others up quickly, giving you +3 to appropriate speaking rolls. In addition you know something of local habits and traditions, giving you get a +3 bonus to appropriate Knowledge rolls, such as Legend Lore.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20II-%20Characters/virtues-and-flaws/#2-virtues_2","title":"+2 Virtues","text":"<p>Blackmail: You have information that some powerful person would prefer kept hidden. You receive payments or services in return for your silence, and you may occasionally demand special favors. Don't push your luck\u2014your victim may decide it isn't worth the cost, or silence you permanently. This benefit has a yearly value of about 50 silver pennies, possibly more if you keep the pressure on. You should detail and record the specifics of this arrangement.</p> <p>Enchanting Music: When you set your mind to it, you can influence others in a specific way with your music. For a specific effect, you must sing words that people can understand. You can calm the grieving with tunes alone, but you need lyrics to convince peasants to rise up against the local lord. When you use Enchanting Music, roll a die (stress or simple, depending on the situation) and add Communication and Enchanting Music. A roll 9+ will calm the upset, a 12+ will win someone's love, a 15+ will incite a riot, an 18+ will touch the heart of a Magus, and a 24+ might win back a soul from the Prince of Darkness. If you botch, you inspire an unwanted emotion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Enchanting Music 1, which can be improved as other talents.</p> <p>Faerie Friend: You have an ally among the fey. How much assistance you can get depends on the power of the friend\u2014a small faerie with (relatively) minor powers can accompany you on a day to day basis. Powerful faeries have other business, and may only be available to answer questions and provide guidance, not to accompany you around on your adventures. Your ally is fully sentient, has its own powers, and can speak when it chooses. You may want to have another player act the part. While a faerie companion can be a great boon, it can also be a terrible burden. If it is nasty or mischievous, it could cause trouble for you everywhere. Characters with this Virtue can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.</p> <p>Famous: You have a good Reputation, level 4, in the area surrounding the covenant. You should detail the noteworthy deeds you performed to earn this fame.</p> <p>Gossip: You have regular social contacts in the area that provide you with all kinds of information about local social and political goings-on. On a simple roll of 6+, you hear interesting news before almost everyone else. You treat all local Reputations as twice their actual level. With some well-placed words, you may be able to bestow new Reputations (whether deserved or not). You quite likely have a Reputation too\u2014as a gossip.</p> <p>Great (Characteristic): You may raise any Characteristic from +3 to +4. Make sure you describe what it is about you that causes that increase (such as sheer bulk, a lean build, or extreme charisma).</p> <p>Hex: You have the power to bring injury or ruin to your enemies. You must wish a specific calamity upon a person by cursing him aloud, and the storyguide (based on a stress die roll modified only by your Hex score) determines whether you succeed. Example target numbers are 9+ to cause a calf to be born with three legs, 15+ to bring a debilitating illness in the victim's family, or 21+ to cause the victim to be killed in a strange accident. Assuming the roll is successful, the hex strikes your victim anywhere from a day to a month later. Divine power or magic might offer protection, but a hex can often bypass this by affecting the victim indirectly. Sometimes the Church punishes those whose curses are widely known to have come true. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Hex 1, which can be improved with experience points.</p> <p>Indulgences: You have a number of indulgences (remissions of sin), which have been bestowed upon you by the Pope. You may sell these, keeping some money for yourself, or you may grant them to individuals in return for \"services to the Church\" (that is, doing something for you). Each indulgence confirms the remission of one sin, and you can have no more than 20 at any time (roll two dice). When all have been granted or sold, you may purchase more by returning to Rome.</p> <p>Intuition: You have a natural sensitivity that allows you to make the right decisions more often than luck can account for. Whenever you are given a choice in which luck plays a major role (such as deciding which of three unexplored paths to follow), you have a good chance of choosing correctly. The storyguide should secretly roll a simple die. On a 6+, your intuition kicks in and you make what ever might be considered the \"right\" decision. Otherwise, you fail to get any flash of insight and must make the decision without aid.</p> <p>Jack-of-All-Trades: Despite your lack of training, you can attempt things that others equally unskilled would find more difficult. You suffer no penalties to rolls against a Skill in which you have no score, provided you have some time to consider what you are about to do. (There is normally a -3 penalty to use Abilities you do not possess.) Skills that are exclusive to a particular group (such as Hermetic Skills to magi) are still beyond you, unless you belong to the appropriate group.</p> <p>Training: You have access to a trainer who has a score of 6 in three different Ability Scores, and can teach you during one season each year. This trainer has a +1 Communication. Determine the specifics of the individual and the relationship with your storyguide. You may have to travel to get training, but do not have to pay or provide services in return for it.</p> <p>Latent Magic Ability: You have a magical quality that has not yet manifested itself. You probably do not realize you have this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguide's discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine).</p> <p>Lightning Reflexes: You respond to surprises almost instantly. In fact, your reflexes are sometimes so fast that you don't have a chance to think about how you are going to respond. Whenever you are surprised or startled, roll a stress die + Quickness. If you get a 3 or better, you respond reflexively. You must tell the storyguide what one type of action (attacking, blocking, running, etc.) you would like to respond with. If attacking in response, you gain +9 to your Initiative Total. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what happens (though it is always in the best interests of your immediate self-preservation). You only react to threats that you are not fully aware of, so you don't get a bonus against an assassin you watch sneak up on you. Note that you do not get a choice about whether to react. You could just as easily skewer a friend sneaking up in fun as you would an assassin about to strike. Also note that you must perceive an action to react to it\u2014you can still be easily killed in your sleep. This Virtue gives you no special powers of perception.</p> <p>Light Touch: You have especially good hand-eye coordination and great proficiency for using your hands in precise, fast ways. You gain +3 to all rolls involving subtle manipulation of objects (like picking pockets) and roll one less botch die than you normally would in such activities (minimum of one). This bonus does not apply to archery.</p> <p>Luck: You perform well in situations where luck is more of a factor than skill or talent. You get +1 to +3 (storyguide's discretion) on rolls in such situations, depending upon how much luck is involved. You do well at games of chance, but may be labeled a cheater if you play them too often.</p> <p>Magical Animal Companion: You are accompanied by a magical animal that's smart enough to follow your orders. The smaller and more innocuous the creature, the more intelligent it is. A ferret or crow is as intelligent as a human, a wolf is very cunning, and an animal the size of a horse is simply more intelligent than normal. If you wish, you may give your magical companion up to two points of Virtues, balanced with one Flaw point of your own. The creature has a Magic Might score of 10 - Size.</p> <p>Mentor: A person of some importance, wealth, or wisdom has taken an interest in your life, and at times provides you with material aid and advice. However, at some point your mentor may have a small favor to ask of you. He might not necessarily like your relationship with the covenant\u2014perhaps you must keep it a secret.</p> <p>Patron: An influential person provides you with materials and a handsome (by medieval standards) salary, in return for services of some kind. The relationship with your patron is one of business more than friendship, and you may occasionally have to walk on eggshells to avoid any unacceptable behavior, whether real or imagined.</p> <p>Piercing Gaze: By staring intently at people you make them feel uneasy, as if you are peering into their souls. Those with ulterior motives, uneasy consciences, or lying tongues must make rolls against an appropriate Personality Trait, Guile, or whatever the storyguide deems appropriate, to remain calm. Furthermore, you gain a +3 to rolls involving intimidation. Faeries and demons are unfazed by your power.</p> <p>Reserves of Strength: Once per day, when in need, you can perform an incredible feat of strength. For the duration of the action, add +3 to your effective Strength score. Afterwards, though, you must make two Fatigue rolls.</p> <p>Skinchanger: You have a magical cloak, animal skin or similar item made from an animal. While in physical contact with it, you may transform into the form of the animal represented by the item. The transformation takes one full round, and you retain both intelligence and sentience while in animal form. Clothing and possessions (save the animal item) do not transform, and you may be seen as a transformed human with InIm 20 or similar spells. If the item is stolen, the new owner has a arcane connection to you, and you may not transform until the item is retrieved. Skinchangers may transform into any nonmagical animal between Size -5 (robin) and Size +2 (bear). The character has the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 252), except that +3 is added to the character's Soak score (in animal form only).</p> <p>Superior Armaments: You can start with expensive arms and armor.</p> <p>Temporal Influence: Through blood or a position of trust, you enjoy some political weight in society. You have the ear of a leader and may yourself lead common folk at times, if they respect your position. The more influence you have, the more responsibility, and the harder it is to work unopposed with magi.</p> <p>True Love: You have found the one person meant for you in all of creation, and the bond between the two of you cannot be sundered. Whenever you are suffering, in danger, or dejected, the thought of your love will give you strength to persevere. Thus, you may add +3 to appropriate Personality Trait rolls, and add additional bonuses as allowed by the storyteller (never in excess of +3) to activities that will return you to your love, or save her life. In dire need, she may even come to rescue you. On the other hand, you are tied to your lover, to whom you must return frequently. If you do not, you may suffer penalties to most actions requiring spirit due to melancholy. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it.</p> <p>Visions: You often see images related to emotionally or magically laden events. A vision might be of the past, a possible future, or a distant occurrence, and is often symbolic or confusing. Visions usually come to you at quiet times in places connected with a powerful emotional or magical event, such as the site of a patricide or diabolic sacrifice. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Visions 1, which can be improved with experience points. When you wish to use this Talent, you tell the storyguide what specifically you would like to have a vision regarding. The storyguide assigns an ease factor based on the difficulty of gaining information about the topic. The storyguide should then make the roll in secret\u2014on a botch, incorrect information is divulged.</p> <p>Withstand Magic (companions and grogs): You are innately nonmagical and can resist many spell effects. You have a +6 bonus to natural resistance rolls against spells, faerie powers, and infernal powers. This bonus also applies to your Soak score against damage from spells. You resist good magic as well, and suffer a -6 penalty on any roll to determine if a beneficial spell (like healing) affects you. This Virtue does not apply to the effects of Exceptional Talents, nor does it protect against powers of the Dominion. You can have no magical powers.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20II-%20Characters/virtues-and-flaws/#3-virtues_2","title":"+3 Virtues","text":"<p>Charmed Life: Fortune protects you from the most terrible injury and harm. Whenever you botch, you may reroll the original roll and take the better result. You should describe in detail how you manage to avoid the terrible fate. The storyguide should also be lenient where there is a chance of your rescue or protection.</p> <p>Fast Learner (companions and grogs): You get an extra experience point per story and per year (allotted during the summer) because of your ability to pick up knowledge faster than normal. You begin the game with 10 extra experience points to use in purchasing Abilities. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Virtue\u2014it is much more useful in decade- or century-spanning sagas than it is in more short-lived ones.</p> <p>Giant Blood (companions and grogs): The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.</p> <p>Guardian Angel: You have learned to hear the words of a divine watcher who gives you practical and spiritual advice. The angel whispers in your ear and tells you what is best for you spiritually, rather than materially. It approves of violence only when there is a holy reason\u2014often difficult to demonstrate. If you act against the angel's advice, it may leave you until you correct your ways. Your guardian angel may help you by bestowing +3 to rolls when you are resisting infernal powers, depending on the current state of your soul. The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, it can hear and converse with you.</p> <p>Highly Trained: You start with 20 additional experience points that you may spend in any way that you choose.</p> <p>Large (magi): As the +1 Virtue of the same name for companions and grogs.</p> <p>Protection: You are under the aegis of a powerful person, usually a noble or high-ranking Church official (though other options are possible, if the storyguide approves). Those who know of your favored status treat you carefully; those who do not often pay the price. You have a Reputation (good or bad, your choice) of level 3, which could be higher if your protector is particularly great or well-known.</p> <p>Relic: You own a holy relic, such as the finger bone of a saint, with one Faith point in it. This can be built into any other item you possess (a sword, for instance).</p> <p>True Faith: Through piety and holy devotion you have faith that can move mountains. You have one Faith point and can gain more. For more about Faith points, see page 244.</p> <p>Visual Eidetic Memory: You remember everything you see as vivid images, giving you an increased chance to recall things and visualize them precisely. You gain +3 to all Intelligence rolls to remember a scene; if successful, you get another roll at an additional +3 (+6 total) to recollect all but the slightest of details.</p> <p>Wealth: You own land and other valuable things, and have a yearly income of about 700 silver pennies. You can have a mount of your own and automatically start the game with excellent arms and armor.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20II-%20Characters/virtues-and-flaws/#4-virtues","title":"+4 Virtues","text":"<p>Destiny: Your life is heading toward a definite, though as yet unknown, culmination, whose nature is hinted at in prophecies and dreams. This sense of purpose gives you the strength to overcome fear, depression, and discouragement caused by anything not relevant to your destiny; you gain +3 on appropriate rolls. If an untimely demise ever threatens the fulfillment of your purpose, then something, somehow, will likely preserve you. You will meet your fate at the proper time, though it may cost you your life. You must have the approval of your storyguide to select this Virtue.</p> <p>Divination: Divination involves divining the nature, location, and possible futures of people, places, objects, and events through a variety of methods. This Virtue grants you the Exceptional Talent Divination at level 1, which can be improved with experience. Numerous types of divination existed in the 13th Century. This talent gives a character knowledge of only a specific type of divination. Common forms of divination in this era include astrology, analyzing dreams, gazing into fires, crystals, or mirrors, and reading the entrails of animals. Each variety of divination gives similar results, but each requires its own special preparations which must be performed in order to divine effectively. To ask a question the diviner must make a stress roll adding Divination and Intelligence; the result must equal the level of difficulty for the question being asked.</p> <p>Examples of sample questions with their levels of difficulty are listed below. Note that divination does not imply predestination. A correct reading about the future will only give you the most likely of all of the possible futures.</p> Roll Required Nature of Question 9+ Answer one question about a distant person's current fate. 9+ Answer one question about an object which is present. 12+ Determine the location or fate of a distant object. 12+ Determine the basic character of a person 15+ Determine auspicious and inauspicious days and times for performing a given endeavor * 18+ Determine some important piece of information about the possible future of an individual 18+ Determine the likely course of a planned endeavor <p>*If the diviner successfully determines the best day and time for a single endeavor which takes place in a limited time frame (not more than a day) and requires a single roll (for example, looking for a lost treasure, asking a favor of the king, or playing a game of chess with death), then the diviner rolls a simple die, and compares it with the following: 1-6: +3, 7-9: +6, 10: +9.

The storyguide decides how far into the future the divined time is.</p> <p>If the endeavor is a long one requiring numerous rolls, like fighting a battle, going on a journey, or slaying a dragon, a successful divination roll gives a +1 to all rolls directly concerning this endeavor. If the diviner botches the roll to determine an auspicious day and time, then they have inadvertently determined the worst possible time for such an endeavor, and all the bonuses listed above are treated as penalties.</p> <p>Entrancement: You have the power to control another's will. By staring deeply into someone's eyes for several seconds\u2014generally impossible in combat\u2014you can verbally command the person to perform a certain task.

Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.</p> <p>Mythic (Characteristic): You have may raise one Characteristic from +3 to +5, making it a score of epic proportions. In addition to this increase, once per day you may perform an incredible feat of limited duration (such as lifting an extreme weight, running a great distance in a single day, or using a bow to shoot a cherry out of someone\u2019s hand) related to that Characteristic, without having to make a roll.

The severity of the curse determines the number of Flaw points: in general, the more intense or commonly manifested the effect, the higher the point value. Example \u20131 Curses: everything you say is taken in the worst possible way, or a live toad appears in your mouth when you speak a direct lie. Example \u20132 Curses: you stutter uncontrollably when you try to say something important, or if you ever tell a secret that was entrusted to you, the secret somehow harms you. Example \u20133 Curses: you are pained by light, with greater light bringing greater pain, or you see shapes and phantoms in the night that terrify and immobilize you. Example \u20134 Curses: you are doomed to be wounded in every battle you take part in (and in some that you try to avoid), or normal tools break whenever you use them.</p> <p>Enemies: Someone is causing trouble for you, such as a local baron or bishop, a band of outlaws, or a really nasty innkeeper. The enemy must be powerful enough to endanger you\u2014this is best agreed on with the storyguide and the rest of the troupe. The value for a local enemy with moderate means is \u20131. Vastly powerful enemies with considerable means and spare time to spend making your life miserable are worth up to \u20134.</p> <p>Outsider: You belong to a group that is both readily identifiable and distrusted or disliked. Examples include Saracens, Jews, and Moors. You are shunned and often persecuted because of this, and your life and freedom may occasionally be in peril. You have a bad Reputation of level 1 to 3 (depending upon how easy it is to identify you) among members of the dominant social group of your area. There is no way for you to ever remove that stain, and you are marked by it wherever you go. The cost of this Flaw is equal to the Reputation that it causes.</p> <p>Vow: You have sworn to do something difficult, and breaking your vow is a serious matter. Examples vows include never raising a weapon, never speaking, or living in poverty. If you do fail to uphold your vow, you must perform some kind of atonement, whether it be religious penance or coming to terms with your failure in some other way. Furthermore, you lose one point of Confidence. Depending on your vow, some people may respect your dedication, giving you a good Reputation of level 1 among those people. The cost of this Flaw depends on the severity of your vow and the frequency with which it is tested. The storyguide is the final arbiter of the cost of this Flaw.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20II-%20Characters/virtues-and-flaws/#-1-flaws_3","title":"-1 Flaws","text":"<p>Bad Reputation: People in an area know of you and hold you in ill regard. Choose an appropriate Reputation, level 2, within that area.</p> <p>Black Sheep: You come from a prestigious family, but you have somehow estranged yourself from your relatives. They have nothing to do with you, unless they wish to punish you somehow. Those who resent your family\u2019s power can take safe revenge by assaulting you. You begin the game with a bad Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who respect your family.</p> <p>Compulsion: You have an unfortunate urge that causes you problems. Examples include drinking, sex, perfection, bragging, or gambling. You may take this Flaw more than once.</p> <p>Dark Secret: You are haunted by something that would lead to shame, rejection, and possibly revenge if discovered. Hints about the secret continually arise, and there might be others who know it and could betray you. This makes you avoid certain places, dislike certain people, or fear certain things.</p> <p>Deep Sleeper: When you sleep, you don't go halfway. You can sleep through loud noises and generally only wake up when shaken, or when good and ready. Even then you suffer -3 on your rolls for half an hour or so after awakening, and you're likely to head back to bed if at all possible.</p> <p>Delusion: You believe wholeheartedly in something that just isn't so. Examples include that you are a magus (if you are not), that you are the Pope's child, or that your imaginary friend is real. This can cause real problems for you and your associates.</p> <p>Dependent: You are responsible for someone, like a young child or a decrepit grandparent. This restricts your freedom and time in a variety of ways, which may change with time\u2014a child grows up and moves away, a grandparent gets seriously ill and requires constant care. You may take this Flaw repeatedly to reflect several dependents.</p> <p>Disfigured: A visible disfigurement makes you ugly and easy to recognize. Presence rolls that involve good looks and gaining respect from most people are at -3. You probably have a cruel nickname that refers to your unfortunate appearance.</p> <p>Driving Goal: You have some personal objective that you feel compelled to attain, even if it gets you into trouble or jeopardizes the group. Such goals are ideal or open-ended\u2014you can never finally accomplish them. Examples include freeing peasants from oppression, harassing and killing Norman warriors, or amassing vast amounts of personal wealth. You may take this flaw more than once.</p> <p>Dutybound: You adhere to a restrictive code of conduct that forbids certain behavior, probably including prohibitions against lying, killing prisoners, stealing, and other occasionally useful actions. You follow this code out of guilt or fear rather than high-flown moral standards, and may spend more time justifying yourself than keeping your conduct pure.</p> <p>Evil Eye: One of your eyes is misshapen, causing your face to have a frightening appearance. People generally regard you as evil, and hide their children's faces from your gaze. You are at a -3 when dealing with mundanes in any social setting, in addition to any penalty you may have for the Gift.</p> <p>Expenses: You must pay a significant portion of your wealth and income (25% - 50%) to a person or organization, or devote it to expenses that bring you no personal gain. Failure to pay your dues brings unpleasant consequences, such as the loss of privileges or the ill will of an important person.</p> <p>Faerie Enmity: Faeries dislike you and take every opportunity to pester you. Faerie forests are extremely dangerous, but even field faeries may spoil your food, plague your dreams, or otherwise torment you. Luckily, your life is not in danger\u2014they prefer to let you live so they can continue to harass you.</p> <p>Favors: You owe a boon to someone (or to a great many people), and may be called upon to return the favor at any time. The consequences of ignoring such a request can range from mild to deadly serious, at the storyguide's discretion.</p> <p>Fragile Constitution: You are sickly and weak. You suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls to recover from wounds and diseases.</p> <p>Hatred: You are consumed with hatred for some person who is so powerful that exacting proper vengeance is impractical or impossible. Nevertheless, you constantly pursue opportunities to gain power over or hurt the object of your hatred, so much so that your reason is clouded.</p> <p>Hunchback (magi): You have a deformed body that gives you a grotesque appearance and hinders your movements. You are at a -3 to all rolls involving agility and balance. Presence rolls that involve good looks are at a -3.</p> <p>Infamous Family: Your family is very well known, but not very well liked. You have a bad Reputation at level 3 among those who know your family, and have a particularly hard time losing it because it applies to the whole family, not just you. You have trouble trusting others because the community has always acted against you.</p> <p>Judged Unfairly: Somehow you come across the wrong way to people, and they universally distrust and underestimate you. You catch no one's eye, impress no one, and can get no one to take you seriously. If you ever find an exceptional someone who sees you as you want to be seen, you will cling to that person.</p> <p>Lost Love: You have lost your true love to death, distance, or marriage. You take little joy in life's pleasures and give up easily in the face of difficulty, since you've already lost the most important struggle. On those occasions when you forget yourself and have a good time, you inevitably feel sorrow afterwards, thinking about how it could have been if your love were with you.</p> <p>Low Self-Esteem: You have a deflated opinion of your own self-worth. You begin the game with only 2 Confidence points.</p> <p>Magical Air (companions and grogs only): Although you do not have the Gift, you look and act like a magical person. This can be detrimental when dealing with mundane society\u2014you suffer the same -3 penalty to social interaction rolls as magi.</p> <p>Magic Susceptibility: You are easily affected by magic. You suffer a -3 penalty on all magic resistance and natural resistance rolls, and get -3 to Soak against direct magical damage. However, you receive a +3 bonus when rolling for the effects of beneficial magic.</p> <p>Meddler: You want to fix other peoples' lives: arrange matches, teach children to sew \"properly,\" or tend the sick. You waste a lot of time and energy on such endeavors, and people usually resent it. You have a Personality Trait of Meddlesome +3 and a bad Reputation, level 1, as a meddler. If you are a magus, you probably interfere in the affairs of other magi, companions, and apprentices. You don't violate Hermetic law, but you probably come close\u2014and you almost certainly irritate the other magi of your covenant.</p> <p>Missing Ear: You cannot accurately locate the direction of sounds, and suffer a penalty of -3 to hearing rolls.</p> <p>Missing Eye: You cannot judge close distances easily and get -3 on Attack rolls for missiles. In melee combat you suffer -1 on Attack rolls because your field of vision is limited. You also have a blind side from which people can approach unseen. This Flaw can be combined with Poor Eyesight (below), but the penalties are cumulative.</p> <p>Oath of Fealty: You owe one season of service each year to someone or some organization outside the covenant. Additionally, you must justify your actions to those persons, and sometimes there is a conflict between your oath and your activities in the covenant. Magi are forbidden from taking Oaths of Fealty by the Hermetic Code.</p> <p>Obese: You are large because of fat, not muscle. You are at -1 to all rolls that involve moving quickly or gracefully and at -3 to all Fatigue rolls. Your Size is +1, and so you gain one Hurt Body level. You do not gain an extra Fatigue level.</p> <p>Obligation (companions and grogs): You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.</p> <p>Obsessed: You are fixated on some prized object, action, or ideal. This interferes with your accomplishment of more immediate tasks. Examples might include obsessive protection of magi to the point that you attack those who insult them, or obsessive neatness where you keep yourself spotless and deride those who do not.</p> <p>Offensive To Animals: (companions and grogs only): You are somehow disturbing to animals. Horses do not let you ride them, and dogs growl or cower in your presence. People may well suspect you of being a wizard or Devil-worshipper.</p> <p>Oversensitive: Something that others find merely unpleasant you consider intolerable. Examples might include an oversensitivity to disrespect, to slovenliness, or to impiety. If you are the violent type, you may start fights with those who offend you.</p> <p>Poor Armaments: You can only have inexpensive arms and armor, and can only have inexpensive equipment relevant to your occupation.</p> <p>Poor Eyesight: Bleary vision impedes your performance. Rolls involving sight, including rolls to attack and defend, are at $-3$. New environments are disorienting and perhaps frightening for you. This flaw can be combined with Missing Eye (above), but the penalties are cumulative.</p> <p>Poor Hearing: Subtract 3 from rolls involving hearing. Speech that is hard for others to understand because of language, dialect, or accent is almost impossible for you to follow. You often pretend to be listening to people when in fact you are not.</p> <p>Poor Memory (companions and grogs): You have a very hard time recalling one type of thing, such as names, faces, or places. When attempting to remember such an item, you must make a stress roll of $6+$ to succeed. You get $-3$ on any other memory-related rolls. On a botch, you recall incorrectly but are convinced you have the right information. For best effect, the storyguide should make recollection rolls secretly.</p> <p>Reclusive: You prefer to do things on your own, and do not like being interrupted. You feel that an intrusion by another upon your time is unnecessary at best, and an insult at worst. You have a Personality Trait of Reclusive $+3$. If someone interrupts you, make a stress roll against this Trait; on a $6+$, you rudely show them the door. If you botch, you lose your temper completely, while a multiple botch likely results in violence as you try to get rid of the pest.</p> <p>Short Attention Span (companions and grogs): You have trouble concentrating, which makes it hard to learn anything. You must earn double the normal experience points to raise your Knowledge Abilities, and expend twice as much to buy them in the first place. Keeping watch, listening to complex orders, following the plot of a story, or performing other such tasks that require continued attention are usually not within your ability.</p> <p>Simple-Minded: You can only think about one thing at a time\u2014guarding the bridge, hunting for a missing ring, or hiding in the trees for example. You become easily confused unless others give you very clear instructions. When unexpected circumstances pop up, you find them difficult to deal with.</p> <p>Social Handicap (companions and grogs): You have some trait that keeps you from interacting easily with other people. This impairs your dealings with most of society, causing penalties of $-3$ on appropriate rolls. Examples include morose temperament, unworldliness, an unpleasant odor, or outspoken atheism.</p> <p>Soft-Hearted: You cannot bear to witness suffering, and causing it brings you sleepless nights. Even the deaths of enemies are painful for you. You avoid danger and try to keep your friends out of it as well. Life and health mean so much that you would rather give up important goals than let another person risk combat. You are easily moved by song and story.</p> <p>Tainted With Evil (magi): An air of corruption surrounds you as a result of something you, your parens, or your ancestors did. Others naturally feel very ill at ease around you, and can easily grow to hate you. Gaining a positive Reputation is impossible. Magi do not react as strongly to this attribute as normal people.</p> <p>Uncommon Fear: Something that others find innocuous or even pleasant makes you nervous, edgy, and unable to concentrate. If you are prone to violence, you might respond by attacking or destroying the feared thing, but only if you cannot escape its presence. The object of your fear is not something you're likely to meet on a daily basis. Examples include wild animals, strange sounds, and clergy.</p> <p>Weakness: You have a soft spot for some object or person. In the face of this, all else is unimportant: promises are forgotten, duties neglected, and common sense cast to the winds. Examples include poets and storytellers, food, flattery, or a pretty face.</p> <p>Weak-Willed: You look to others for guidance rather than to yourself. Those who try to fool, intimidate, or manipulate you gain $+3$ to their rolls. What you need more than anything else is to find someone you can trust.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20II-%20Characters/virtues-and-flaws/#-2-flaws_2","title":"-2 Flaws","text":"<p>Clumsy: You are not very graceful and tend to drop things\u2014you are at a $-3$ in all related rolls. Furthermore, roll an extra botch die when taking actions related to Dexterity. Roleplay your clumsiness.</p> <p>Common Fear: This is just like the flaw Uncommon Fear, but the thing that frightens you is more frequently encountered. Examples include fires, buildings, and the touch of others.</p> <p>Curse of Venus: You are very attractive to people whom you do not wish to attract (add +3 to Presence rolls). People you detest keep getting crushes on you, and will not be dissuaded. Furthermore, you tend to fall in love with inappropriate people, and in inappropriate circumstances. These people you are interested in tend to think you are vain and shallow, causing a \u20131 penalty on Presence and Communication rolls.</p> <p>Decrepit: You have one Decrepitude point (see page 181) from old wounds or a past serious illness.</p> <p>Diabolic Upbringing: Your parents were diabolists, and though you have escaped their evil ways, you are still haunted by your upbringing and the memory of acts best left unspoken. Thoughts of demons plague you, and you live in a constant state of dread and hatred. The powers of Hell might have a special interest in your soul. You may purchase the Knowledge Occult Lore, even if you are normally not permitted to buy Arcane Knowledges.</p> <p>Haunted: You are plagued by a ghost that only you (and those with Second Sight) can see and hear. It insults, berates, and distracts you\u2014especially when you need to keep your cool. It might steal and hide your smaller items, give others near you the chills, or cause a buzzing in your ears that prevents you from hearing clearly. In no case, however, does the ghost have any powers when more than seven paces away from you. The storyguide should use his imagination in making the ghost irritating but not fatal. Yelling can drive the ghost away for a time, but also confuses those around you. Unless you are exceptionally strong-willed, you might have to aid the ghost in its purpose in order to be rid of it. A magus with this Flaw is haunted by a particularly powerful ghost, and therefore has trouble controlling it even with spells. It also often interferes with magical research, giving \u20133 to all Lab Totals.</p> <p>Hunchback (companions and grogs): As per the \u20131 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.</p> <p>Infamous: People know you well and curse you in their prayers. You have a level 4 bad Reputation, specifying the horrible deeds that earned you such ill will.</p> <p>Lame: One of your legs is weakened, whether since birth or through some accident. You move slowly and clumsily. Your base speed is a mere one mile per hour, and anyone can outrun you. You suffer a \u20136 penalty on rolls involving moving quickly or with agility, \u20133 on Dodge, and \u20131 on other combat scores.</p> <p>Lycanthrope: You have been cursed to change form into a dangerous predator (such as a wolf, lynx, or bear) on nights of the full moon. No items or clothing transform between shapes, and it takes one full round for the full transformation to take effect. You are not immune to normal weapons, and the curse does not infect bite victims. The animal may be detected as a cursed human with a InIm 25 or equivalent spell.</p> <p>You have the intelligence of a animal while changed, react to all stimuli as an animal, and do not retain any memory of actions taken in animal form, save occasionally in dreams. You may not even realize that you are under this curse. You can still recognize both friends and enemies when changed.</p> <p>Lycanthropes may transform into any non-magical animal between Size \u20131 (wolf) and Size +2 (bear). You have the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 252), except that +3 is added to your Soak score (in animal form only). Furthermore, you are fully healed of all wounds incurred in animal form upon resuming human form (which happens at dawn).</p> <p>Missing Hand: Perhaps it was an accident or a punishment in your past that cost you one of your hands. Climbing, combat, and other activities normally requiring both hands are at a penalty of \u20133 or greater.</p> <p>Noncombatant (magi): You have no interest or ability in the fighting arts. You cannot learn any Weapon Skills, and suffer \u20133 on all Attack and Damage scores. You may not learn combat spells (defined at storyguide discretion). You cannot pick Virtues and Flaws relating to armament quality. You may learn and engage in cert\u00e1men.</p> <p>Obligation (magi): You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.</p> <p>Overconfident: You have an exaggerated and unshakable opinion of your capabilities, and you do not hesitate to try things that promise only defeat. If you are convincing in your speech, you can infect others with your overconfidence. You gain the Personality Trait Overconfident at +3.</p> <p>Poor: You have almost no wealth, and for some reason you can never seem to hang onto the valuables you do gain. You automatically begin the game with inexpensive arms and armor, and whenever you put your hands on something of value, you can bet you won\u2019t have it for long.</p> <p>Poor (Characteristic): You have an exceedingly bad Characteristic\u2014lower one which is already \u20133 to \u20134. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a feeble stature, hideous visage, or slack-jawed stupidity.</p> <p>Sheltered Upbringing: You grew up completely separated from society, knowing only your parents or mentor. Recently you have been introduced to a wondrous new world of strangers, and you are overwhelmed. Depending on your personality, you might react with contempt, fear, or wonder. You are unable to function normally because you cannot understand most human customs. You suffer a penalty of \u20133 to most tasks involving social interaction, and you may have no Social Talents or Skills as beginning Abilities. Eventually you may overcome your upbringing.</p> <p>Small Frame (companions and grogs): You are of a lighter-than-average build. Your Size is reduced by 1. You have no Hurt Body Level and no Winded Fatigue Level.</p> <p>Tainted With Evil (companions and grogs): As the \u20131 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above. Mundanes react much more strongly to your atmosphere of corruption.</p> <p>Terrors: Some specific thing fills you with overwhelming dread. You can do nothing but scramble and fight to flee its presence. If escape is impossible, you are likely to collapse into a quivering heap. The object of your fear is common enough that it will be encountered from time to time, but rare enough that you are not totally incapacitated. Examples include criminals, deep forests, heights, wide open spaces, and caves.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20II-%20Characters/virtues-and-flaws/#-3-flaws_1","title":"-3 Flaws","text":"<p>Arthritis: Your joints are stiff and often painful, making almost any prolonged movement difficult.

For much of your life you could not speak, and knew nothing of human ways. Now that you have joined human society (or the covenant), you have learned to understand some basic spoken phrases, but civilized life is still a mystery you want little part of. You may only choose beginning Abilities that you could have learned in the wilds or picked up at the covenant (such as how to use a mace instead of a club). You have neither the inclination nor the capacity to learn more refined skills, and have no Speak or Scribe Own Language Ability.</p> <p>Fury: A violent temper sometimes overwhelms you, sending you into a destructive, uncontrollable rage.

Then, you decide if you wish to expend a Fatigue level in order to increase the power of the spell. If you choose to Fatigue yourself you are pushing your limits\u2014you must roll a stress die whether you are in a stressful situation or not. If you do not Fatigue yourself, you roll either a stress or simple die depending upon whether there could be an immediate harmful result if you do not cast the spell.</p> <p>Once you have made those determinations, roll the appropriate die, add the appropriate Technique and Form, your Intelligence, and Encumbrance. Divide this total by two if you elected to expend a Fatigue level, and divide it by five if you did not. The final result is the level of the spell that you have cast.</p> <p>Refer to the guidelines for the Technique/Form combination you used (in the Spells chapter) to determine whether your spell is of high enough level to have the effect you desire. If it is too low, a lesser effect may still occur, if relevant, based on the level you did manage to attain. If your result was zero or lower, there is no spell and therefore no effect. Unless you specify otherwise, the effect that you produce will have the default range, duration, and target for the Art combination you are using.

If you do specify otherwise, see \u201cRanges, Durations, Targets\u201d on page 103 to determine how changing those parameters changes the level of the spell.</p> <p>For example, a magus comes upon a small stream with a rocky bank. The magus doesn\u2019t wish to get his feet and robes wet crossing the stream, so contrives to cause some of the rocks to arrange themselves as stepping stones across the stream. He knows no formulaic spell that will do this, so decides to try a spontaneous one. The appropriate arts are Rego (because he wants to move something) and Terram (because he is moving rocks). His relevant Arts are 10 and 6, respectively, and his Intelligence is +3. He is not encumbered. He decides that the success of this spell is not extremely important, so elects not to fatigue himself. As the situation is not stressful, he rolls a simple die, getting a 7. His total, then, is 10 (Rego) + 6 (Terram) + 3 (Intelligence) + 7 (his roll) = 26. He divides by 5 (because he didn\u2019t fatigue himself), generating a spell of level 5. Checking the Rego Terram guidelines in the spell chapter, we can see that he has just been able to move a Small amount of dirt. He has not succeeded in moving the stones as he wanted, but nevertheless, a handful of nearby sand scatters itself sympathetically across the path he desired for the stones.</p> <p>Had the magus elected to fatigue himself, the total, 26, would have been divided by 2, for a total level of 13.

For example, if an enemy magus causes a tree branch to swing down and strike you, you can fast-cast a spontaneous spell in response to make the branch swing wide.</p> <p>There are three steps to determine the success of a fast-cast spell: compare speed, roll for casting, and determine spell potency.</p> <p>As the situation demands, compare your stress die + Quickness + Finesse + Encumbrance to the stress die + Quickness + Finesse + Encumbrance of another spell caster, to the Initiative Totals of those attacking you physically, or to an ease factor set by the storyguide. If your opponent's total is higher than yours, their spell or attack beats your fast-cast spell. In this case, you must roll to maintain concentration before you can cast a spell (presuming you still wish to cast it at that point). This is a normal concentration roll, based on any interruptions you've suffered.</p> <p>Next, roll for your spontaneous spell and subtract 5 before dividing the roll. That is, roll Technique + Form + Intelligence - 5, divided by 2 if a Fatigue level is spent or divided by 5 if not. If you roll a 0 when fast-casting, you must roll three extra botch dice.</p> <p>Fast-cast defenses have very limited range, duration, and potential for seriously affecting targets, as their levels tend to be low. The duration of most fast-cast counterspells is Momentary.</p> <p>You completely ward off a spell attack if your total equals or exceeds half the penetration of the attacking spell. Otherwise it penetrates anyway. When defending from mundane attacks, a spell total of 10 protects you from a single attack, 15 from up to three known attacks, 20 from any number of known attacks, and 25 against all attacks, known or unknown. These results assume that your spell is appropriate to defending against attacks: a Perdo Ignem spell, for instance, may stop flaming oil from harming you, but will be ineffectual against axe strokes.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20III-%20Hermetic%20Magic/casting-spells/#recognizing-spells","title":"Recognizing Spells","text":"<p>The Form required for fast-cast defense against a certain mundane attack is easy to determine (for example, ReTe would be a good choice for redirecting sword swings), but for fast-cast defenses against magic, you must at least be able to determine the Form of the magic you are defending against, or you will be unable to construct an appropriate defense.</p> <p>If the attacker is a Hermetic magus and is using words you can hear or gestures that you can see, then you can determine both the Technique and the Form of the attacking spell automatically.

It is required to cast ritual spells, and you can use it to strengthen spells. With spontaneous spells, your only use for raw vis is to increase your spell roll (and thus increase the level of the resulting spell). With formulaic and ritual spells, you may use raw vis to extend range, extend duration, or increase your spell roll. You must always use vis that is of the same Form or Technique as the spell you are casting with it, and you must be physically touching the substance within which raw vis is contained in order to use it.</p> <p>When you choose to use raw vis, you must determine the number of pawns that are to be invested in the magical activity before you initiate it. Once you have established the number, you cannot change it, and if the spell is disrupted, fails, or botches, all the vis you dedicated to it is lost. When using vis to increase your spell roll, add +5 to the roll for every pawn of vis expended. When casting spontaneous spells, you add this bonus before the roll is divided. If you want to increase the range or duration of a formulaic or ritual spell (to the amount listed after the slash in the description), you expend one pawn of raw vis per 5 levels of the spell or fraction thereof. If you wish to extend both range and duration, you must expend vis for both. Note that using raw vis to strengthen a spell is tricky, and you must always roll a stress die when strengthening a spell with vis, even if you have mastered the spell in question. In addition, if you roll a zero, you must roll one extra botch die per pawn of vis expended.</p> <p>There are limits to the amount of vis you can utilize at one time. Your highest applicable Art score is the maximum number of pawns of vis you may invest into a single round of magical action or the initial casting of a given spell. Furthermore, you cannot spend more pawns of a given type of vis than you have score in that art. For example, if a magus with Perdo 10 and Mentem 6 cast a Perdo Mentem spell, he could use up to 10 pawns of Perdo vis, or up to 6 pawns of Mentem vis. He could also choose to use Perdo vis and Mentem vis in combination, as long as the total number of pawns does not exceed 10 and the number of pawns of Mentem vis does not exceed 6.</p> <p>For laboratory activities, Vim + Magic Theory is the limit to the number of pawns of vis (regardless of type) that you may use in one season. Vim is used because it's representative of magic as a whole, so it imposes a limit on the amount of magic you can work with over an extended period.</p> <p>If you try to use more vis than your appropriate Art or Vim score allows, whether you are casting a spell or working in the lab, the extra points are used up, but you do not gain any benefit from them. They do not count towards the action attempted, but you still have to roll one extra botch die per pawn of vis expended.</p> <p>At the storyguide's option, the uncontrolled magical power that you release may affect your surroundings, causing magical side effects in proportion to the amount of uncontrolled vis expended.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20III-%20Hermetic%20Magic/casting-spells/#casting-a-spell-while-maintaining-another","title":"Casting a Spell While Maintaining Another","text":"<p>Certain spells require that you maintain concentration on them to sustain their effect.

It serves as a nonlethal way for one magus to establish dominance and precedence over another, and has formal restrictions to keep it from disrupting the unity of the Order. One need not accept a challenge to cert\u00e1men, but the social cost may be no less than that of accepting and losing. You may challenge anyone to cert\u00e1men once, but the Code prohibits you from challenging the same person again unless he challenges you in the meantime. Thus, you cannot hound an unwilling opponent into cert\u00e1men. Cert\u00e1men is solely an institution of the Order of Hermes; non-Hermetic wizards do not have the ability to participate in the ceremony.</p> <p>To engage in cert\u00e1men, you and the other magus must agree on one Form and Technique combination you will both use.

The rules of cert\u00e1men permit the use of any system for determining the Arts used as long as it is acceptable to both magi.</p> <p>Once the Technique and Form are chosen, you and your opponent concentrate for a moment, both entering trances.

Each becomes attuned to the magical forces surrounding them, shaping them into phantasms representing the Technique and Form of the duel. If the Technique and Form are Muto and Anim\u00e1l, the phantasms might be two animals, one controlled by each magi. During the course of the duel, each animal changes into various other animals in an effort to defeat the other. A Creo Ignem contest could consist of two fiery beings fighting.

This spell, which must be of the same Technique and Form of the contest, circumvents the loser's Parma Magica (though the loser still gets a magic resistance roll based on the Form of the spell). In most cert\u00e1men contests, this \"free\" spell is unnecessary, because your opponent's collapse already designates your victory. However, some duelists use it anyway to intimidate and embarrass those who fight them. This free spell can be used to harm your fallen opponent, but remember, cert\u00e1men is intended to be a harmless way to resolve disputes.</p> <p>The second way to win cert\u00e1men is by surrender. If your opponent realizes he is outmatched, or wants to walk away from the duel, he can concede the contest. Such a submission means that loser is still capable of defending himself, so he has full Parma Magica and Magic Resistance against any final spell cast at him.</p> <p>The third way to win cert\u00e1men is to maintain concentration in the face of distraction when your opponent does not. Concentration rolls are not necessitated by the loss of Fatigue levels during cert\u00e1men. Sometimes, however, conditions surrounding the duel necessitate that the duelists make Concentration rolls. If one of the duelists fails a Concentration roll, the fight ends. The duelist's loss of concentration causes his phantasm to disappear, indicating the opponent's victory. A victor through loss of concentration does not get a free spell.</p> <p>Loss of concentration, however, does not necessarily mean that cert\u00e1men is over and that a victor is decided.

You combine one Technique and one Form to cast a spell, and together their names indicate the spell's general function.

Among the common people there sometimes appear rare individuals with the Gift\u2014those who have innate magical power. Only these individuals can become apprentices and eventually magi. Luckily for those magi who seek them, these people inevitably stand out from the crowd. They are almost invariably intelligent and curious, causing them to fit in poorly with the mass of ignorant, superstitious society. Also, most potential apprentices somehow attract supernatural attention to themselves. In many populations there is a youth who is prone to wandering alone at night, who is the subject of much town gossip, and who displays a precocious wit. Chances are that such a person is a potential apprentice.</p> <p>Searching for an apprentice can lead to good storytelling and roleplaying possibilities, especially if the search is complicated by enemy forces or uncooperative members of the child's family. However, if you do not wish to make a story out of finding an apprentice, you may determine the results of the search with a die roll. For every season you spend searching for a potential apprentice, make a stress die and add your Perception. If the result is 6+, you find one. If you botch, you may think you've found a child fit to be an apprentice but are somehow duped, either by the child or by some power that replaces your child with its servant.</p> <p>Your student should be between eight and seventeen years old at the beginning of apprenticeship (if you wish, roll a simple die + 7).

First, decide the effects of the spell you wish to invent; you may pick a spell described in the Spells chapter to invent (to save you from having to find a copy), invent a variant of a spell listed there, or you can make up something completely on your own.</p> <p>If you want to duplicate an existing spell, use the statistics given for it in the Spells chapter, but include your wizard's sigil (see \"Sigils\" on page 60).</p> <p>If you create a variant of a spell in the Spells chapter (change its range, say, or allow it to affect a different kind of target), first refer to the spell that you are basing your spell on. Then determine whether you are changing the spell's range, duration, target, or a combination of those. The new spell's level is determined based on how radically the new spell is different from the old one. The method for determining the new spell's level is described under \"Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets\" on page 104.</p> <p>When you invent a completely new spell you must describe it fully, both in terms of its mechanics (range, duration, and target) and how it fits into the medieval paradigm. You must make sure that it takes into account the limits of magic (see page 67). To determine the new spell's level, you must first determine its Technique and Form. This should be a matter of common sense. Next, refer to the general guidelines for that Technique/Form combination, found in the Spells chapter. This will provide a list of what sorts of effects correspond to each spell level. Once you have determined this base level, check the default range, duration, and target for your Technique/Form combination. If you would like your spell to have a different range, duration, or target, refer to the guidelines for changing them under \"Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets\" on page 67.</p> <p>For example, say a magus wishes to create a spell that lights a fireplace. The spell is obviously Creo Ignem\u2014it creates fire. Turning to the guidelines for Creo Ignem, we see that igniting something flammable (like wood) takes a level 5 spell. We also see that the basic range for Creo Ignem is Near, the basic duration is Momentary, and the basic target is Small. The magus wishes to be able to do this from across the room, so the range Near makes sense. He wants it to set logs on fire, but the magic need not sustain the fire\u2014wood will burn by itself once ignited. The duration is therefore Momentary, as per the default. The magus decides that the target Small is not large enough to ignite the large fireplace in his covenant's great hall. Therefore, he must move the default target of Small up one step to Individual, adding five levels. The final level of the spell, then, is 5 (the basic level of the effect) + 5 (to move the target from Small to Individual), for a total of 10.</p> <p>Once you have determined the specifics of the spell you are trying to invent, you must determine if you can actually invent it. Then, you must figure out how long it will take. You can only invent a spell if your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level. You get a bonus for knowing a similar or variant spell (+1 per five levels of similar spell\u2014see \"Similar Spells\" on page 69), and you may also add your aura rating as a bonus to your Lab Total. Any requisites that the new spell has also count in figuring your Lab Total. For each point that your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level, you accumulate one point per season.

Second, you always have an arcane connection to your talisman, making it easy to find if it is lost (but also making it a hazard if it falls into enemy hands). Third, your talisman is fully protected by your Magic Resistance if you are touching any part of it.

Finally, even when you're not touching your talisman, it receives the Magic Resistance offered by your Form scores.</p> <p>In addition to the basic powers of a Talisman, you may also, at any time, spend a season to open your talisman to one kind of magic attunement, based on the shape and material of the talisman. Use the \"Form and Effect Bonuses Table\" to determine what attunements are possible. Your talisman may be able to accept more than one kind of attunement, and can hold more than one attunement, but you can only invest one new attunement per season. For instance, a magus can enhance his staff talisman by spending a season to attune it to spells that control things at a distance. He then gets a +4 bonus on rolls with spells that control things at a distance (because that is the bonus listed on the Form and Effect Bonuses Table). He could further enhance it to give him a +3 to project bolts and missiles (for example), but that would take another season.</p> <p>Bonuses from attunements only apply when the magus is touching the talisman. They do not apply to Magic Resistance or any laboratory activities.

An effect is like a spell, and must be fully defined, as a spell is. You may base the effect on a spell from the Spells chapter, or may invent your own effect. If inventing a new effect, you must design the effect carefully, as if inventing a new spell. The level of the effect is the equivalent of its spell level. You should confirm your effect level with the storyguide. Also, remember the effect's starting level. The actual level of the effect may change as you define the parameters of the effect, but the starting level is essential to scores, like Penetration, that are needed when the effect is used.</p> <p>After laying out the parameters of the effect, you must decide how frequently you use the effect. Consult the \"Effect Frequency Table.\" The number you choose corresponds to a modifier, which is added to the level of the effect. Next, if the effect is not of Constant Use, you must specify a triggering action or ritual of some kind to activate the effect. The trigger must be specific about exactly what actions need to be performed. A trigger can involve a command word or phrase, moving the item in a specific way (for example, waving or pointing a wand), a stance to be adopted, or anything physical that you can imagine. The enchanted item cannot read thoughts, so the trigger action must be physical, not mental.</p> <p>Finally, choose any effect modifications you wish to apply to the device (see below), adjusting the level of the effect for each modification.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20IV-%20Laboratory/apprentices/#effect-modifications","title":"Effect Modifications","text":"<p>You have some options on how effects in an invested device operate.

For each factor of range and duration that you want to leave open to accept vis in the field, add +3 to the effect's level. For instance, a healing wand only heals damage temporarily unless vis is used with it (the same amount of vis that is required for the spell being imitated). Therefore, you must leave the user the option to add vis to extend the duration of the effect, thereby adding 3 levels to the effect. The number of pawns of vis that may be used in the field to extend range and duration is limited. The wielder may only expend a number of pawns of vis equal to his score in the Art that corresponds to the type of vis being used.</p> <p>Penetration: You may elect to have the effect make Penetration rolls using the Art scores you had when the effect was originally invested, rather than using the device's own power, by adding +4 to the level. (Of course, this means you must record these scores for future use.) You may also elect to have the effect Penetrate according to the current Art scores of its wielder. This adds +8 to the effect's level.</p> <p>Concentration: When investing an effect, you can arrange to have the device maintain concentration on the effect for the wielder. This option adds +5 to the effect's level. Note that the wielder still needs to concentrate to change how the effect is used. For instance, a levitation belt that does not require concentration can hold someone in the air, but to move up or down the wielder must concentrate. Effects left to their own concentration start to wear off at sunset and sunrise. At these times the wielder must concentrate on the effect for a few moments to perpetuate it until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first.</p> <p>Effect Use: You can restrict the use of a device's effect to a specific list of people (for example, to you and all your current apprentices) by adding +3 to the level of the effect. Otherwise, invested devices can be activated by anyone who knows their trigger actions.</p> <p>Charges: It is possible to instill an effect whose power expires after a given number of uses. The following table lists Lab Total modifiers to place a given number of charges in a device. Each time the power you have instilled is activated, one charge is used up. When all the charges have been used, the item stops functioning.</p> <p>Note that you must still choose a number of uses per day when you instill an item with charges. Thus such an item is restricted in how often and how much it can be used. You cannot give charges to an item of Constant Use.</p> <p>A device that uses charges can be made rechargeable by adding 5 levels to the level of the effect. Actually recharging the effect takes one season and costs an amount of vis equal to that which was originally spent investing the effect. In order to recharge a device, you must either have the lab text (see below) from the device's creation, or you must successfully investigate the power which you are recharging.</p> Number of Charges Effect Level Modifier 1 \u20135 2 \u20134 3 \u20133 6 \u20132 12 \u20131 24 0 50 +1 100 +5 <p>Effects that Govern the Device Alone: Some effects work only on the device in which they are placed, such as a staff that grows thorns like the spell Transformation of the Thorny Staff.

Magi of two hundred years or older are rare, but not unheard of.</p> <p>The longevity potion acts as a magical anchor, sustaining the vital life force of the magus, often by directly affecting the tissues of the magus's body. This anchor, however, prevents the magus from expending his life force in normal human fashion, so the magus becomes permanently sterile. Though called a potion, the longevity effect may be imparted through any number of media. Charms, potions, clothes, and tattoos are just some of the possibilities, each one having unique properties. A longevity charm, for example, has to be worn constantly to provide its preserving power; if it were removed, you could die immediately, or you might slowly fade away until the charm was returned or a new longevity \"potion\" created.

In the world of Ars Magica, magi can create longevity potions to stave off the effects of aging. A longevity potion is a specialized, single-use type of enchantment that affects whatever it is applied to.</p> <p>Normally, only Creo, Corpus, and Vim vis may be used in a longevity potion. However, a longevity potion is a very personal creation, and as such, it is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. You may, with the approval of the troupe or storyguide, substitute any type of vis that your magical talents are strongly associated with.</p> <p>A longevity potion's effect lasts until you actually suffer the ill effects of aging; that is, you develop an affliction, have the score of an existing affliction increase, or gain a Decrepitude point through aging (see \"Aging\" on page 180). After this, the potion loses its effectiveness and a new potion must be brewed. You can invent a new potion (following the normal rules for doing so), or brew a new batch from the old formula. This involves simply making a new investment of vis (of an amount based on your current age) but no significant investment in time. This \"replacement\" potion may be created using your lab text (see next section) from the previous brewing. If your longevity potion fails and you make aging rolls before you create a new one, you suffer the full effects of your age. You do not gain back any affliction points or Decrepitude points that you suffered when you were not under the effects of a potion when you do finally take one.</p> <p>When creating a longevity potion for the first time, you can increase its potency by adding extra vis to the brew. This vis is above and beyond that which you must spend for your current age. For each additional pawn you add to the brew, add 1 to your Lab Total. This vis is invested when you originally create a given version of a potion, but you must use the same amount of vis with each new potion of this formula that you make when the previous one fails. If you reinvent the potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, you can choose not to use extra vis. Extra vis spent does not increase your Lab Total to determine if you can create a longevity potion in the first place.</p> <p>You can make longevity potions for others, even for non-magi. To determine the ingredients for another person's potion, you and that character must spend one season of research and brewing. Your Lab Total (based on Intellego Corpus), plus aura, must equal 30+. Otherwise, you cannot determine what ingredients need to go into the potion. If your score is 30+, you can make the potion and must invest one pawn of vis per five years of the character's current age. A longevity potion made for another magus functions just as if made for you (-1 to aging rolls for every 5 points of Lab Total). Non-magical people, however, are not as resilient as magi.

Because of the inflexible, complex nature of enchantments, however, a lab text is not as useful as a spell written out in full. While a written spell aids you in learning a spell and maybe creating other spells with similar effects, a lab text only allows you to duplicate the results of a previous laboratory enterprise.</p> <p>You should keep a record of your magus's life in the laboratory, so you know what sorts of lab texts you have access to.

Lab texts that detail longevity potions also give a bonus to the magus's Lab Total, making more recent potions more potent and more helpful to resisting aging. However, a lab text for longevity potions is only useful when recreating a previous batch of potions, though it is still valid if you have to add more vis to the new potion based on your increased age. If you're creating a new potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, previous lab texts are useless because you are creating a whole new formula.</p> <p>If you create a longevity potion and make a lab text of it, that text is only of use to you.

You gain the bonus of his Magic Theory score at the time he wrote the text.

By using Im\u00e1ginem, you can alter what others perceive. Im\u00e1ginem, however, means \"image,\" not \"illusion.\" Thus, one creates, transforms, perceives, destroys, and controls images, not necessarily illusions. A clairvoyance spell, therefore, is Int\u00e9llego Im\u00e1ginem because it detects real images. By manipulating sensations, however, you can create effective illusions. The Art of Im\u00e1ginem rewards the creative magus by fooling people into actions they would otherwise shun: for instance, they might walk off a cliff, while their eyes tell them there is a bridge over the chasm.</p> <p>Stenches and perfumes, tints and stains, color and shadow, melody and cacophony, sweet and sour; all these are perceptions, and so can be manipulated by the Art of Im\u00e1ginem. An image works on the senses, not on the mind, so an unthinking beast is as likely to believe an image as an imaginative human. Nevertheless, Im\u00e1ginem spells are still most effective at fouling the communication on which human society depends. Beasts are likely to be fooled by illusions, as are the simpler undead. Demons are very hard to deceive, while faeries often see through illusions and manipulate them to fool you in turn. Certain members of the Church have proven remarkably adept at discerning truth from illusion, though the talent is not dependable.</p> <p>It is more difficult to mimic a specific object or person using an Im\u00e1ginem spell than it is to mimic a general image, and requires a Perception + Finesse stress roll. For example, it is easier to imitate a generic gold ring than it is to reproduce the gold ring with inscriptions that the baron presented to his wife on the occasion of their tenth wedding anniversary. The higher the roll, the better you can fool people. You get a bonus to your roll for familiarity with what you are mimicking (~3 for an unfamiliar object, +3 for highly familiar objects or for having the subject available for modeling). For mimicking people, a roll of 6+ lets you fool acquaintances of the person, 9+ lets you fool friends, and 12+ lets you fool close friends and relatives. Use a similar scale for mimicking objects. If you botch the Finesse roll, you may think the image is satisfactory, but it's immediately seen through once in use.</p> <p>A ritual for special attention is Eyes of the Past (InIm 20).

They help you use your spells to better effect, and since using spells efficiently is what being a master magus is all about, these spells are very important. With imagination, you can use these spells to make wards, alarms, one-use magic items, and other interesting things. Many Vim spells are meant to be cast along with other spells, and modify or change their effects. Such Vim spells have no spell foci.</p> <p>Vim magic also encompasses dealing with demons. Summoning and dealing with demons is prohibited within the Order, but fighting them is allowed.</p> <p>Magi often use Vim to counteract magical phenomena. Storyguides should assign spell levels for all magical phenomena that those using Vim counterspells will have to match.</p> <p>Most Vim spells are of General level, because the magic that Vim spells affect varies widely in power. A spell to dispel a first magnitude spell needs to be much less powerful than a similar spell to dispel a fifth magnitude effect. The guidelines provided for Vim spells take account of this, and rather than giving an absolute level for a corresponding effect, they give the relationship that the level of the Vim spell must bear to the level of the target. Thus, the guideline for creating a ward against demons states that the level of the ward plus a quality die minus 5 must exceed the Might of the demon.</p> <p>As usual, these guidelines refer to a spell with the basic range, duration and target. When changing these parameters the change in level should be taken account of before multiplying or dividing the spell level to get the effect. Thus, a version of Wind of Mundane Silence (PeVi) with Far range would dispel a spell cast with a Technique + Form total of less than half (spell level - 10). Ten levels of the spell's power are devoted to increasing the range, and only the remaining power is available for the effect.</p> <p>The Individual target for a Vim spell can refer to either an individual spell, or an individual object or person, and similarly for Group. If the target is an object or person, the Vim spell will affect any suitable magic affecting that person, not just one spell. Most such spells can only be cast on either other spells or individuals, but, if the description suggests that they could be cast on either, then they can. For example, Mirror of Opposition can only be cast on other spells, while The Invisible Eye Revealed can only be cast on people or objects.</p> <p>The guidelines below refer mainly to spells. This is for the sake of brevity, as Vim spells can affect magical effects proceeding from magical items, magical creatures, or demons. However, unless specifically stated otherwise, the spells do not affect magical items, only the effects that they produce. Thus, Wind of Mundane Silence could dispel a stone wall produced by a magical item, but Disenchant is needed to dispel the magic of the item itself.</p> <p>It should be noted that Hermetic magi, and some non-Hermetic wizards, do not have Might scores, and thus are not affected by wardings or other spells that act against Might scores.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20V-%20Spells/vim-spells/#creo-vim-guidelines","title":"Creo Vim Guidelines","text":"<p>There are few Creo Vim spells known throughout the Order.

Although demons deal in Vim, they are made of the essence of deception itself. If a demon does not wish to be detected, it cannot be (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), and for this reason there are no demon-locating magics. Magic items cannot be investigated with simple magic spells. Investigation requires that you spend at least one season in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains (see the Laboratory chapter). A spell will suffice to tell you that an item is magical, however, and may give you some idea of its powers. Spells will never tell you how to use an item.</p> <p>Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual.</p> <p>A first magnitude Int\u00e9llego Vim spell will detect magical effects of tenth magnitude or higher. For every magnitude by which the detecting spell is increased, decrease the minimum spell to be detected by two magnitudes. Thus, a sixth magnitude spell will detect \"zero magnitude\" effects: the traces of powerful magic, or the recent presence of weak magic. Further increases in level will give increased sensitivity to residues. This level of spell also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of the magic (within a magnitude). The addition of one magnitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well. The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other types of magic. Further increases in level will yield further information, depending on the design of the specific spell.</p> <p>Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spell only affects one realm, and storyguides may wish to disallow spells to detect the Divine or Infernal.</p> <p>As a general rule, residues of magic decline as follows. As soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves. It then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes. Storyguides should employ this as a guideline, not a rigid formula, and may, if they wish, allow high level detection spells to pick up residues with 'negative magnitude'.</p> <p>Magical items have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawns of vis used to open the enchantment (or half the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices). Magnitudes of non-Hermetic items must be set by the storyguide. A spell to detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice-versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above.</p> <p>Magical creatures can also be detected. Treat their Might as the level of the effect: for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might or highest Art by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude. Again, this requires a different spell, and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures. Demons may not be detected. Storyguides may, at their option, allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead.</p> <p>Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrelevant, as is the realm of power that it was designed to detect.

If this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch. You don't have to double botch dice on it, though.</p> <p>If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus, you must either be co-operating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell spontaneously. There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition, your Penetration total for the Muto Vim spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are co-operating.</p> <p>These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depend on a good understanding of the processes involved.</p> <p>You may only put a Muto Vim effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All Muto Vim spells require some tailoring to the specific use, hence the additional botch dice, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored.</p> <p>Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way: it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants. See the example spells for ideas on how specific this should be.</p> <p>Gen: Superficially change a spell of less than twice the level of the Vim spell.

This may not change either the Technique or Form of the target spell. A change in power of plus or minus one magnitude is a significant change, as is a change of target, if the target was possible for the original spell.</p> <p>Gen: Totally change a spell of less than half the level of the Vim spell. This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts. The Vim spell affects the structure of the spell, not the things that the spell targets. A change in power of up to two magnitudes is a total change.

The bandits are armed with a sword, sword, and dagger respectively. Sir Boris would like to engage all three, keeping all of them at Reach. The first two bandits would like to engage at Reach as well, so no engagement contest is required. The third would like to move to Touch to use his dagger, but his engagement contest fails (as he compares his 11 to Sir Boris' 20).</p> <p>Sir Boris' Attack Total against each is diminished by 6 (-3 for each beyond the first). Assuming that his Attack score is 10 and his roll is a 7, he generates an Attack Total of 11 (10 + 7 - 6) against each of his opponents. Sir Boris' Defense Total is likewise diminished by 6 against each opponent.</p> <p>If the bandit with the dagger had succeeded in closing to Touch range, Sir Boris would have attacked the two with swords with an 11, as above, but would have only had a 5 to hit the dagger-bearing opponent, since he has a further -6 when using his sword at one range inside its optimum range. His defense totals against the bandits with swords are the same as they are above, but again, against the Touch range opponent, he would suffer a further -6. (Of course, at Sir Boris' option, he could use his Brawling skill to defend against the Touch range opponent.)</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20VI-%20Combat/all-out-attack-or-defense/","title":"All Out Attack or Defense","text":""},{"location":"Chapter%20VI-%20Combat/all-out-attack-or-defense/#all-out-attack-or-defense","title":"All Out Attack or Defense","text":"<p>There may be times when you want to throw caution to the winds and press the attack at the expense of defending yourself.

The same holds true in Mythic Europe.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20X-%20Mythic%20Europe/eastern-europe/#those-who-toil","title":"Those Who Toil","text":"<p>The first of the great classes is the peasantry. A peasant's purpose is to provide the basic needs of life for everyone else,</p> <p>so that the clergy are free to deal with God, and the nobles are free to fight their wars. Even though this work makes everyone else's achievements possible, it is considered the most ignoble of tasks, allotted to the most inferior of humanity. Disease, malnutrition, crop failure, and heavy taxation are the peasant's usual lot.</p> <p>The upper classes believe that God created their stations and filled them with appropriate people. Thus, gratitude to the laboring class is not a consideration. Just as God decrees a person's social position, so too does He restrict its members: inequality is ordained.</p> <p>The peasant is bound to his or her superiors by a social contract: \"If you fight to keep me safe, I'll feed you. If you do your best to save my soul, I'll feed you.\" However, peasants have rights as well as responsibilities. They have the same chance of salvation as cardinal or king, and therefore have the same access to the blessings of the Church: baptism, consecration, last rites, and Christian burial. They also are entitled to decent treatment and full protection from their superiors, though what they actually get depends on the mercy of their lord and the allegiances of the local clergy.</p> <p>Needless to say, the rights of the peasants are not always observed. However, for the upper classes to break the contract is to invite the peasantry to do the same. Every time a noble tramples the fields on a hunt, or ravages the countryside in a needless war, the peasants take note. Every time a parish priest breaks his oath of chastity, or a mendicant order buys cloth-of-gold, the peasants remember. The prospect of a peasant revolt haunts every abusive noble and hypocritical cleric, though in truth, most peasants are very loyal to their lords.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20X-%20Mythic%20Europe/eastern-europe/#those-who-pray","title":"Those Who Pray","text":"<p>The second great class of people in Mythic Europe is the clergy. The social bargain demands they do the work of mind and spirit. In earlier times, saving souls was their only purpose, but over time, priests, monks, and nuns assumed other important tasks.</p> <p>The first of these is to control and administer the social order. God created society, they argue, so God's representatives should run it. When peasants seek to overreach their limits, parish priests remind them that their lot is God's will. When nobles fight each other in useless wars, the bishops chasten them with their divinely ordained responsibility to protect the land against invaders, not neighbors. Disobedient kings are reminded that they rule by the will of God, which is known only to the pope.</p> <p>The second task is to manage thinking. Excessive thought is dangerous for those not assigned to it; it makes them aware of the injustices of life, which can lead to social turmoil. Peasants are supposed to be good farmers. Nobles are supposed to be good warriors. Neither group should have to think any more than necessary\u2014it's not their job. Saracens, pagans, Jews, and magi are doubly damned, for their thoughts are not only blasphemous, but in defiance of God's order.</p> <p>A few clergy are so certain of their righteousness that they defy temporal laws, establishing their own \"divinely sanctioned\" order. By putting a price on absolution from sin, popes take bribes to assure a peaceful afterlife. Cardinals, abbots, and abbesses scheme for political power and control of lands. How long such practices are accepted depends upon the moral outrage of society, or of the few who have power to intimidate the priestly class.</p> <p>The clergy are divided by an internal war, one which has been brewing for some time. On one side are those who believe their first task is the most important; they are the defenders of order, the enforcers of orthodoxy. When this means restraining mad nobles or rooting out diabolists, these clergy accept the task and are considered heroes. Sometimes, though, this requires excommunicating a noble with a new idea or suppressing magi, even benevolent ones. In such cases, these clergy are seen as oppressors.</p> <p>On the other side of the struggle are those who seek knowledge above all else. They are frequently the attackers of orthodoxy, and fight the bigotry that too often arises with the emergence of anything new and different. For these clergy, \"It's God's will\" is no answer to any injustice. They say God made people with the power to think for themselves.

First was Bonisagus, who discovered a way to create a simple magical shield that protected one from spells (now called simply the \"Parma Magica\"), and began work on a universal theory of magic. The Parma Magica would permit magi to meet with little fear of being attacked, and a universal theory of magic would give them a reason to work together.</p> <p>The sorceress Trianoma, apprentice to Bonisagus, made good use of the Parma Magica. Its protection permitted her to seek out wizards all across Europe. She was a gifted diplomat, well able to convince her peers of the benefits a unified Order would bring. Wizards would be guaranteed their individual freedom, but the Order provided the means by which peace could be kept among them. A unified theory of magic would allow them to share their discoveries and knowledge. Trianoma encouraged many magi to visit with Bonisagus and share what they knew with him. From Druids, for example, he learned how to create new spells at a moment's notice. This skill developed into spontaneous magic. The rudiments of ritual and formulaic magic grew from the traditions of the Roman cult of Mercury, which worked powerful magic in prolonged rituals involving many participants. Using this and other knowledge, Bonisagus developed a broadly applicable theory of magic, now known as Hermetic theory.</p> <p>While Bonisagus unified the magic of the magi, Trianoma masterminded their political unification. She had brought twelve magi together who all wanted to form an order. They learned the Parma Magica, studied Bonisagus's theory of magic, wrote the Code, and named their order after the Greek god of magic, whose cult they knew to predate the Roman cult of Mercury. At Durenmar in the Black Forest in A.D. 767, the twelve magi swore to uphold the Code of Hermes, and the Order was formed.</p> <p>Since these magi could work together and share what they learned, they grew quickly in power. They realized that with the power of magic in their hands, the only other mortals they needed to fear were other magi. Systematically they sought other wizards out and offered them membership in the newly reformed order.

A great wealth of information about the Loch Leglean Tribunal can be found in the Ars Magica supplement Lion of the North.</p> <p>The Stonehenge Tribunal covers England and Wales. The domus magna of House Ex Miscellanea, Cad Gadu, is located in this tribunal. The Stonehenge Tribunal is disorganized, in part because many of the tribunal's magi live in isolation, and in part because of the rapid clearing of land and forest deprive them of the opportunity of live apart from society in magical areas.</p> <p>The Iberian Tribunal covers all of the Iberian peninsula, including land currently held by the Moors. The politics of the Iberian Tribunal are chiefly concerned with the Reconquista, though there is certainly nothing that could be called agreement among the magi. At least two covenants routinely side with the Moors against the Christian forces. Although conflict is common, many covenants have a great wealth of both mundane and occult knowledge, plundered from conquered Moslem libraries and gained from Moorish scholars. You can find more information in the Ars Magica supplement Iberia.</p> <p>The Normandy Tribunal covers France, including Burgundy and the Low Countries. It is home to Fudarus, the domus magna of House Tytalus. As the land here becomes more and more crowded with mundanes and the influence of the Dominion, the covenants of the tribunal must become more and more hidden and isolated.

When they cannot get people to worship them, or to stop worshipping God, they use other methods. Demons especially love destruction; however, this doesn't serve the long-term interests of the Prince of Darkness, as it usually sends people running to the protection of the Church. The soul is the prize; the body alone is as useless to the Devil as it is to his divine counterpart.</p> <p>Violence is an effective strategy against wizards, though, especially Hermetic magi who are protected from many infernal powers by their Parmae Magicae. Magi are able to harm demons with their spells and are unlikely to turn to the Dominion, which interferes with magic. Thus, demons tend to bring their more overt powers to bear in confrontations with them.</p> <p>Demons also employ possession, entering the victim's body and taking it over partially or completely and making the person commit \"evil\" acts. This does not taint the victim's soul, regardless of what the neighbors think. A soul can only be corrupted through a human's free will. Therefore, possession is a less desirable form of attack as well. Demons use more subtle approaches to seek human damnation.</p> <p>Demons primarily use temptation: some moral dilemma is presented to an individual, who must make a choice with no arm-twisting. In making the wrong decision, the mortal taints his or her soul.</p> <p>Oppression is a more broad-based attack, provoking emotions that are sinful in nature. The demon creates a general mood that affects large groups of people, by bringing about evil and unnatural events that affect the environment. The oppressive atmosphere sours moods and brutalizes emotions, encouraging people to respond with evil acts and damn themselves. Those who can see the world from a spiritual perspective are immune to this effect.</p> <p>Obsession is a direct supernatural attack on a victim, brought about by the demon's presence. Obsession is distinct from possession, in that the demon never enters the human body but instead heightens inherent flaws. The basic form of obsession is the phantasm, an evil idea or image that flashes across the mind, usually arising from the victim's own darker wishes. A person who cannot resist these urges taints his or her soul.</p> <p>Harder to produce and harder to resist is the psychomachia (pseu-ko-mah-KEE-ah, \"battle for the soul\"): the demon speaks to its victim, in his or her own voice, urging the commission of evil acts. In game terms, any Personality Trait roll is modified by the demon's Psychomachia score, prompting the character to behave sinfully or self-indulgently. The storyguide can also demand a Personality Trait roll from the victim at any time, even when roleplaying and the situation at hand otherwise make it unnecessary.</p>"},{"location":"Chapter%20XII-%20Bestiary/infernal-creatures/#demons-and-raw-vis","title":"Demons and Raw Vis","text":"<p>When their corruptive power touches the Earth, demons often leave behind physical residue in the form of raw vis. Anim\u00e1l, Ignem, Im\u00e1ginem and Perdo vis are most common. If a demon has no obvious affinity with one of these Arts, it usually deposits Vim vis. Demonic vis is frequently tainted with evil, and can cause unpleasant side effects if used in magic. At the very least, double the number of botch rolls usually required.</p> <p>When a demon is defeated or destroyed on Earth, its spirit is banished back to Hell. Often it cannot return to Earth for some time, as punishment for failed machinations; failure can also be punished by infernal torture. Because of this, it is exceedingly difficult to recover the corpse of a devil. Such a deed requires a journey to Hell, not lightly undertaken despite the prodigious vis harvest that can reward success.</p> <p>Some devils are so weak that their spirits only come to Earth in physical form. The corpses of such demons can be harvested for vis. If this is the case, the amount and type of vis available will be set out in the creature description.

The most common form adopted by shapeshifters is that of the wolf, but others are possible.</p> <p>Shapeshifters have many different origins, which determine the power they are aligned with, whether magical, infernal or faerie.

However, changing shape into a form with fewer body levels will not kill a severely wounded character. Unless the shapeshifter is dead, the character will have at least one body level in any form he assumes.

Still the faerie minstrel seemed clearly better, and the faerie lord was grinning.</p> <p>Then the music changed. Jocelin was improvising, and changing the story. The newcomer spoke to the imprisoned knights of their homes and families, left behind desolate, and of the glory to be won on the battlefield, not in this cave. He spoke to them of the shame of being held in thrall by a woman, and roused them to action. As the knights rose to their feet and girded on their arms, preparing to leave, the faerie minstrel began to falter, losing time with Jocelin, the notes clashing. As they turned on their captor, who revealed herself as a fiend with golden claws dripping ink, which scored wounds on the heart, and a voice that pierced the ears with poetry, the faerie minstrel was reduced to singing fragments, off key, and often mistakenly continuing the story. As the faerie was defeated and the knights rode to freedom, he dropped out completely.</p> <p>The face of the faerie lord was like thunder, and darkness swirled within his throne.</p> <p>\u201cYou have won, mortal.

Your companions, however, were no part of our bargain.\u201d Jocelin turned to look at us, stricken, and I felt little better. My mistress, however, was undisturbed. She gathered us close to her, and bowed to the faerie lord. I could see the shadows taking shape around us, warriors with cruel, dark blades. Then she held up a piece of wood from our chambers in Cambridge, and began chanting. The faerie lord screamed with rage, even as he vanished from our sight, and we found ourselves back in Cambridge.</p> <p>We spent two days in the faerie forest, it seems, but Schola Pythagoranis are happy, and my mistress has their support.

My mistress has told me not to write down his name, for his protection. I suspect that ours may also be involved: the Quaesitores might be inclined to take a dim view of such goings on. My mistress needs a public sponsor for her religious order, and this lord is likely to be it.</p> <p>This is a great city, not quite so large as London, but large nonetheless. From the towers of the castle keep, it is all spread out below you, the great cathedral dominating, and the dozens of smaller churches pushing their towers up beyond the level of the houses. It is strange, all these</p> <p>churches and no service, as the interdict continues. Kirst has spoken of the possibility that the Dominion will fade if it continues, since the power of God will lie less heavily on a land that He has rejected, but I have noticed no fading while I have been here.</p> <p>As guests of this lord, we were entertained well in the Great Hall, a truly spectacular room. Of course, my mistress\u2019s Great Chamber will be yet finer. Minstrels played, and Jocelin joined them for a while. He really loves these places \u2014 I think it has something to do with the servant girls. The food, at any rate, was better than I have eaten in some time. The winter stocks here have hardly been touched, it seems.</p> <p>Thirteenth day of Capricorn, thirteen hundred and forty-eighth year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress spent today closeted with the lord, negotiating for his support. I was employed as a valet, bringing food and drink so that none of the lord\u2019s servants need know what was going on. He spoke of the possibility of magical assistance against the Pope, in Ireland, or against the King of France. Of course, my mistress had to refuse. She can hardly break the Code that blatantly in order to build a meeting place for the Tribunal.</p> <p>The talk turned to more personal things: long life, protection from his enemies, and such like. I was sent from the chamber at that point, ostensibly to fetch wine. Since the agreement had been concluded by the time I returned, however, I suspect that the real reason was to prevent me from learning what the terms were. My mistress seemed happy, however.</p> <p>Twenty first day of Sagittarius, thirteen hundred and forty-ninth year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress has just spent three seasons solidly training me, and now she has told me to amuse myself for a while.

This was Flavius of Bonisagus, the youngest magus at the covenant. As we walked through the corridors, torches flared into burning life as we approached, and sank back into darkness as we passed on. We felt, rather than saw, the servants of the covenant pass us, spirits in the darkness. We were taken to the guest area, and warned that the rest of the covenant was off limits. The main reception room was lit by a sphere of crystal which shone like the sun and hung under a gilded dome more than thirty feet across. The walls were hung with tapestries shot through with golden thread, and the furniture was covered with silks. Gems gleamed on the golden utensils, and the aroma of fresh food rose from covered trays. Three silver figures, which I took to be statues at first, proved to be the servants, magically animated and enchanted to see to our needs. My mistress affected disdain for it all, pronouncing it gaudy and vulgar. Truly, it was, but the sheer power on display was enough to awe me. I wish that Jocelin was here to see it, but the magi of Ungulus do not like consortes to visit.</p> <p>We have bedchambers of equal splendor, and equal magic. There are basins into which statues of nymphs pour never-ending streams of water, and a fire that burns without fuel. The bed is hung about with curtains that seem to cut off all noise, and a bell summoned a serving girl who was ready to see to any need I might have. I have sent her away for now, but I think I may summon her again when I have finished this.</p> <p>Twentieth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and fifty first year of Aries.</p> <p>Oh dear. We met with the four members of Ungulus yesterday. Only Flavius was really coherent: the other three must surely be on the verge of Final Twilight. Certainly the magic here seems to have addled them, even if it is not quite ready to take them: they seemed incapable of agreeing on anything, including how to disagree with my mistress. Finally, Flavius got them to agree to support her in return for some service. I'm sure he had something in mind, because he turned to her, but another magus, Sinead Ex Miscellanea, leapt in first, demanding that we deal with a dragon who lives to the north of the covenant. The other older magi immediately agreed with her, and Flavius found that he had no choice but to go along with them. He was not happy about it.</p> <p>My mistress agreed. I think that her mind is going, with this focus on the Great Chamber. We cannot expect to take</p> <p>on a dragon. Were we both Archmagi I would have my doubts: as it is, this is surely madness. I have tried to persuade her of this, but all she will say is that she needs their votes. Soon, then, we will visit the dragon.</p> <p>Eighth day of Virgo, thirteen hundred and fifty second year of Aries.</p> <p>We escaped the dragon, but my mistress will not have the support of Ungulus at the Tribunal. Nor will she ever have Jocelin's support again. I hope that she is satisfied.</p> <p>Blind in her obsession, she was sure that we could handle the dragon. She spent a year researching these things, and preparing supplies for the assault. She hired some skilled mercenaries to train the most loyal grogs, and even Jocelin went into training. I tried to dissuade him, but he only laughed, and said that he would relish being the only minstrel in England to have seen a dragon and lived to tell of it. I am sure that he would have, as well. My mistress will answer for him at some tribunal, somewhere.</p> <p>Our journey across country was uneventful as far as the cave where the wyrm was said to lair. My mistress cast her scrying magics, and declared that it was safe to enter. The grogs went ahead, of course, while Jocelin and I stayed by my mistress. She was almost in a trance, so busy was she concentrating on the route ahead. She led us along a large tunnel, and into a great cave. Daylight filtered in from cracks leading to the surface, and we saw heaps of gold coins, simply scattered about the room, and many chests, full, no doubt, of rich treasures. There was no sign of the dragon.</p> <p>Of course. I do not know what my mistress had been thinking. Her pathetic magics were in no way adequate to the challenge of one of the wyrms. It must have been aware of us since we approached the cave, and now it was waiting, invisible, until we were ripe for the picking. The discipline of the grogs broke, and they ran forward. One of them reached out for the gold, and it disappeared like smoke on the wind, revealing the dragon to our view. Its scales glittered more brightly then jewels, its teeth sang like swords, and its eyes were pits into the depths of Hell. It turned on our grogs, and breathed fire, sweeping over them and destroying them in a moment. Jocelin grabbed me, and turned to run back up the tunnel. My mistress stayed behind, weaving magic in an attempt to stop the beast. There was a scream, abruptly cut off, but we could see the entrance to the cave, and I thought we had escaped. Then the fire came, rushing up the tunnel behind us. Jocelin grabbed me and threw me with a strength I had never even guessed at. I flew out of the tunnel, and rolled down the hill as flame gouted out of the hole. Jocelin did not scream, even for a moment.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-110/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 110","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>ARS MAGICA THE ART OF MAGIC</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-110/#level-30","title":"Level 30","text":""},{"location":"page-refs/page-110/#steed-of-vengeance","title":"Steed of Vengeance","text":"<p>R: Touch/Near, D: Sun/Perm, T: Ind</p> <p>Spell Focus: The Hoof of a Pooka (+5)</p> <p>Turns a horse into a ferocious magical mount.

The Praeco interrupted her to ask about the dangers of meeting in the Dominion, but she parried that one well. Then another member of Blackthorn, Golias of Tytalus, raised a new objection. How, he asked, did she plan to keep control of the religious, when the rest of their order would doubtless want a say. She replied that she planned to form a new order. He asked her how she planned to do that, in the light of the Pope's decree banning all new orders. That rocked her, and with only Voluntas, Semitae, and Schola Pythagoranis supporting her scheme, it was voted down.

Life is a struggle: wars and plagues stalk the land, the Church and kings rule with an iron fist. Yet Mythic Europe is also a place of magical wonder, inhabited by all the creatures of folktale and myth. What the folk of the land believe holds true: faeries and rural spirits must be placated; demons corrupt everything they touch; divine power is accessible through prayer; and magic is everywhere.</p> <p>Against this background, you will play a magus, a member of the mystical Order of Hermes. Your character will wield the magical energy that pervades the world, and seek great arcane knowledge. You and your fellow players will also portray the loyal companions and grogs that stand with the magi in their covenants.

By using Im\u00e1ginem, you can alter what others perceive. Im\u00e1ginem, however, means \"image,\" not \"illusion.\" Thus, one creates, transforms, perceives, destroys, and controls images, not necessarily illusions. A clairvoyance spell, therefore, is Int\u00e9llego Im\u00e1ginem because it detects real images. By manipulating sensations, however, you can create effective illusions. The Art of Im\u00e1ginem rewards the creative magus by fooling people into actions they would otherwise shun: for instance, they might walk off a cliff, while their eyes tell them there is a bridge over the chasm.</p> <p>Stenches and perfumes, tints and stains, color and shadow, melody and cacophony, sweet and sour; all these are perceptions, and so can be manipulated by the Art of Im\u00e1ginem. An image works on the senses, not on the mind, so an unthinking beast is as likely to believe an image as an imaginative human. Nevertheless, Im\u00e1ginem spells are still most effective at fouling the communication on which human society depends. Beasts are likely to be fooled by illusions, as are the simpler undead. Demons are very hard to deceive, while faeries often see through illusions and manipulate them to fool you in turn. Certain members of the Church have proven remarkably adept at discerning truth from illusion, though the talent is not dependable.</p> <p>It is more difficult to mimic a specific object or person using an Im\u00e1ginem spell than it is to mimic a general image, and requires a Perception + Finesse stress roll. For example, it is easier to imitate a generic gold ring than it is to reproduce the gold ring with inscriptions that the baron presented to his wife on the occasion of their tenth wedding anniversary. The higher the roll, the better you can fool people. You get a bonus to your roll for familiarity with what you are mimicking (~3 for an unfamiliar object, +3 for highly familiar objects or for having the subject available for modeling). For mimicking people, a roll of 6+ lets you fool acquaintances of the person, 9+ lets you fool friends, and 12+ lets you fool close friends and relatives. Use a similar</p> <p>scale for mimicking objects. If you botch the Finesse roll, you may think the image is satisfactory, but it's immediately seen through once in use.</p> <p>A ritual for special attention is Eyes of the Past (InIm 20).

Such Vim spells have no spell foci.</p> <p>Vim magic also encompasses dealing with demons. Summoning and dealing with demons is prohibited within the Order, but fighting them is allowed.</p> <p>Magi often use Vim to counteract magical phenomena. Storyguides should assign spell levels for all magical phenomena that those using Vim counterspells will have to match.</p> <p>Most Vim spells are of General level, because the magic that Vim spells affect varies widely in power. A spell to dispel a first magnitude spell needs to be much less powerful than a similar spell to dispel a fifth magnitude effect. The guidelines provided for Vim spells take account of this, and rather than giving an absolute level for a corresponding effect, they give the relationship that the level of the Vim spell must bear to the level of the target. Thus, the guideline for creating a ward against demons states that the level of the ward plus a quality die minus 5 must exceed the Might of the demon.</p> <p>As usual, these guidelines refer to a spell with the basic range, duration and target. When changing these parameters the change in level should be taken account of before multiplying or dividing the spell level to get the effect. Thus, a version of Wind of Mundane Silence (PeVi) with Far range would dispel a spell cast with a Technique + Form total of less than half (spell level - 10). Ten levels of the spell's power are devoted to increasing the range, and only the remaining power is available for the effect.</p> <p>The Individual target for a Vim spell can refer to either an individual spell, or an individual object or person, and similarly for Group. If the target is an object or person, the Vim spell will affect any suitable magic affecting that person, not just one spell. Most such spells can only be cast on either other spells or individuals, but, if the description suggests that they could be cast on either, then they can. For example, Mirror of Opposition can only be cast on other spells, while The Invisible Eye Revealed can only be cast on people or objects.</p> <p>The guidelines below refer mainly to spells. This is for the sake of brevity, as Vim spells can affect magical effects proceeding from magical items, magical creatures, or demons. However, unless specifically stated otherwise, the spells do not affect magical items, only the effects that they produce. Thus, Wind of Mundane Silence could dispel a stone wall produced by a magical item, but Disenchant is needed to dispel the magic of the item itself.</p> <p>It should be noted that Hermetic magi, and some non-Hermetic wizards, do not have Might scores, and thus are not affected by wardings or other spells that act against Might scores.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-155/#creo-vim-guidelines","title":"Creo Vim Guidelines","text":"<p>There are few Creo Vim spells known throughout the Order.

Although demons deal in Vim, they are made of the essence of deception itself. If a demon does not wish to be detected, it cannot be (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), and for this reason there are no demon-locating magics. Magic items cannot be investigated with simple magic spells. Investigation requires that you spend at least one season in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains (see the Laboratory chapter).

Each spell only affects one realm, and storyguides may wish to disallow spells to detect the Divine or Infernal.</p> <p>As a general rule, residues of magic decline as follows. As soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves. It then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes.

Magnitudes of non-Hermetic items must be set by the storyguide. A spell to detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice-versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above.</p> <p>Magical creatures can also be detected. Treat their Might as the level of the effect: for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might or highest Art by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude.

First of all, they cannot be cast on spontaneous spells. Such magic is being manipulated at whim\u2014any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control.</p> <p>Secondly, when you cast a MuVi spell, you get double the normal botch dice.

The same applies to the spell that you are casting on, even if it is being cast by another magus, and even if it is mastered. If either spell botches, both do.</p> <p>Thirdly, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+ if you are casting both spells (that is, the MuVi spell and the spell it is affecting). If this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch. You don't have to double botch dice on it, though.</p> <p>If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus, you must either be co-operating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell spontaneously.

This occurs most often when an archer is firing at an approaching foe. If a character declares intent to engage at Far, Middle, or Near range and wins the engagement contest, that character may fire at the stated range.

The bandits are armed with a sword, sword, and dagger respectively. Sir Boris would like to engage all three, keeping all of them at Reach. The first two bandits would like to engage at Reach as well, so no engagement contest is required. The third would like to move to Touch to use his dagger, but his engagement contest fails (as he compares his 11 to Sir Boris' 20).</p> <p>Sir Boris' Attack Total against each is diminished by 6 (-3 for each beyond the first). Assuming that his Attack score is 10 and his roll is a 7, he generates an Attack Total of 11 (10 + 7 - 6) against each of his opponents. Sir Boris' Defense Total is likewise diminished by 6 against each opponent.</p> <p>If the bandit with the dagger had succeeded in closing to Touch range, Sir Boris would have attacked the two with swords with an 11, as above, but would have only had a 5 to hit the dagger-bearing opponent, since he has a further -6 when using his sword at one range inside its optimum range. His defense totals against the bandits with swords are the same as they are above, but again, against the Touch range opponent, he would suffer a further -6. (Of course, at Sir Boris' option, he could use his Brawling skill to defend against the Touch range opponent.)</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-169/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 169","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER VI COMBAT 169</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-169/#brawling-maneuvers-table","title":"Brawling Maneuvers Table","text":"<p>Maneuver: Damage Replacement (Soak Replacement)</p> <p>Attack: For each Wound level replaced, opponent loses 1 Fatigue level (Regular Soak)</p> <p>Throws: If at least 2 Wound levels are replaced, you unbalance and topple your opponent while remaining standing yourself.

Who oversees the activities of the storyguide's own characters when he is running the story? Who sets the overall story arc for the saga? There are several different ways that such questions can be answered.</p> <p>The first strategy you can take is to adopt a more traditional roleplaying structure\u2014that of one storyguide who makes all the decisions and controls no player characters. This keeps questions of who adjudicates what very simple. Unfortunately, in such cases, the storyguide misses out on the fun of creating and playing characters within someone else's framework. The players, in turn, have a limited capacity to create their own tales.</p> <p>To alleviate this problem, you can change the set up slightly. The single storyguide from the previous structure becomes the alpha storyguide, who sets the main plot arcs for the saga. He adjudicates many stories and all in-between times activities like advancement and laboratory work (except when it involves his characters). Other troupe-members are allowed, under this model, to occasionally run a story, or perhaps a series of related stories.</p> <p>Taking things one step further, the alpha storyguide can give up even more power over the troupe. This third strategy allows each troupe-member who so desires to make up an entire saga arc and become an important storyguide. This approach allows many people with many different ideas to all work together and have a large say in how the saga progresses. The alpha storyteller coordinates the different visions to make sure that everything makes sense. The drawback is that the troupe runs the risk of becoming lost in stories that point every which way, but benefit in that all troupe-members, even the alpha storyteller, can play in a variety of engaging stories.</p> <p>Finally, the position of alpha storyguide can be all but abandoned.

It might be in a manor, a castle, a ship, or a hole in the ground. Covenants provide for the needs of magi in several ways. First of all, they provide security. Mythic Europe is a dangerous place for all, and magi in particular need safety to perform their arcane studies. Covenants also provide for the mundane needs of magi: food, clothing, work space, and the like. Most magi would prefer not to have to devote their time to such concerns. Finally, covenants provide magi with a community of peers. When in a covenant, a magus is surrounded by others who think about things in the same way that he does.</p> <p>Covenants are also the most meaningful way the members of different houses work together and learn from one another. Although some covenants are composed only of members from one house, at least two thirds are composed of magi of different traditions.</p> <p>In fact, loyalty to one's covenant is often the strongest loyalty a magus feels, even more than loyalty to his house. Of course such feelings vary from magus to magus, but the prevalence of such an attitude is an indicator of the importance of covenants to the Order of Hermes.</p> <p>Of course, covenants are important from a troupe standpoint as well.

God created society, they argue, so God's representatives should run it. When peasants seek to overreach their limits, parish priests remind them that their lot is God's will.

First was Bonisagus, who discovered a way to create a simple magical shield that protected one from spells (now called simply the \"Parma Magica\"), and began work on a universal theory of magic. The Parma Magica would permit magi to meet with little fear of being attacked, and a universal theory of magic would give them a reason to work together.</p> <p>The sorceress Trianoma, apprentice to Bonisagus, made good use of the Parma Magica. Its protection permitted her to seek out wizards all across Europe. She was a gifted diplomat, well able to convince her peers of the benefits a unified Order would bring. Wizards would be guaranteed their individual freedom, but the Order provided the means by which peace could be kept among them. A unified theory of magic would allow them to share their discoveries and knowledge. Trianoma encouraged many magi to visit with Bonisagus and share what they knew with him. From Druids, for example, he learned how to create new spells at a moment's notice. This skill developed into spontaneous magic. The rudiments of ritual and formulaic magic grew from the traditions of the Roman cult of Mercury, which worked powerful magic in prolonged rituals involving many participants. Using this and other knowledge, Bonisagus developed a broadly applicable theory of magic, now known as Hermetic theory.</p> <p>While Bonisagus unified the magic of the magi, Trianoma masterminded their political unification. She had brought twelve magi together who all wanted to form an order. They learned the Parma Magica, studied Bonisagus's theory of magic, wrote the Code, and named their order after the Greek god of magic, whose cult they knew to predate the Roman cult of Mercury. At Durenmar in the Black Forest in A.D. 767, the twelve magi swore to uphold the Code of Hermes, and the Order was formed.</p> <p>Since these magi could work together and share what they learned, they grew quickly in power. They realized that with the power of magic in their hands, the only other mortals they needed to fear were other magi. Systematically they sought other wizards out and offered them membership in the newly reformed order.

Others can gain one point by spending at least one year in selfless service to God, if their motivations are pure. Characters concerned only with recognition, esteem, and power do not get the Faith point. A character can only gain more Faith points through extreme devotion to Christianity, and these are lost if he turns even slightly from the path. A person with even a single Faith point is rare; someone with five or more is exceedingly holy and will most likely be canonized after death. Such people can be clergy, though many are extremely reverent lay persons.

When they cannot get people to worship them, or to stop worshipping God, they use other methods. Demons especially love destruction; however, this doesn't serve the long-term interests of the Prince of Darkness, as it usually sends people running to the protection of the Church. The soul is the prize; the body alone is as useless to the Devil as it is to his divine counterpart.</p> <p>Violence is an effective strategy against wizards, though, especially Hermetic magi who are protected from many infernal powers by their Parmae Magicae. Magi are able to harm demons with their spells and are unlikely to turn to the Dominion, which interferes with magic. Thus, demons tend to bring their more overt powers to bear in confrontations with them.</p> <p>Demons also employ possession, entering the victim's body and taking it over partially or completely and making the person commit \"evil\" acts. This does not taint the victim's soul, regardless of what the neighbors think. A soul can only be corrupted through a human's free will. Therefore, possession is a less desirable form of attack as well. Demons use more subtle approaches to seek human damnation.</p> <p>Demons primarily use temptation: some moral dilemma is presented to an individual, who must make a choice with no arm-twisting. In making the wrong decision, the mortal taints his or her soul.</p> <p>Oppression is a more broad-based attack, provoking emotions that are sinful in nature. The demon creates a general mood that affects large groups of people, by bringing about evil and unnatural events that affect the environment. The oppressive atmosphere sours moods and brutalizes emotions, encouraging people to respond with evil acts and damn themselves. Those who can see the world from a spiritual perspective are immune to this effect.</p> <p>Obsession is a direct supernatural attack on a victim, brought about by the demon's presence. Obsession is distinct from possession, in that the demon never enters the human body but instead heightens inherent flaws. The basic form of obsession is the phantasm, an evil idea or image that flashes across the mind, usually arising from the victim's own darker wishes. A person who cannot resist these urges taints his or her soul.</p> <p>Harder to produce and harder to resist is the psychomachia (pseu-ko-mah-KEE-ah, \"battle for the soul\"): the demon speaks to its victim, in his or her own voice, urging the commission of evil acts. In game terms, any Personality Trait roll is modified by the demon's Psychomachia score, prompting the character to behave sinfully or self-indulgently. The storyguide can also demand a Personality Trait roll from the victim at any time, even when roleplaying and the situation at hand otherwise make it unnecessary.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-254/#demons-and-raw-vis","title":"Demons and Raw Vis","text":"<p>When their corruptive power touches the Earth, demons often leave behind physical residue in the form of raw vis.

Demonic vis is frequently tainted with evil, and can cause unpleasant side effects if used in magic. At the very least, double the number of botch rolls usually required.</p> <p>When a demon is defeated or destroyed on Earth, its spirit is banished back to Hell. Often it cannot return to Earth for some time, as punishment for failed machinations; failure can also be punished by infernal torture.

Their strength lies in their inherent magical nature, not in their muscle, though some have supernatural strength. Most rely on illusion, deception and other forms of magic to protect themselves.</p> <p>The goals of faeries are largely incomprehensible to mortals. They lack any need for food and shelter (indeed, none of them ever die or grow old), so are often motivated by a simple desire to amuse themselves. Faeries spend much of their time in games of \"let's pretend.\" They seem fascinated by humanity and play out elaborate games with strict rules, taking on the roles of kings, queens, courtiers, jesters, and knights. Often, the rules require that they do not use powers beyond what their roles permit.</p> <p>It's not easy to put faeries in a mortal context. Think of them as the wild opposites of Mythic Europe's mundane folk. They are the restless, endlessly creative, playful, unfathomable, and unleashed reflection of stolid humanity. They are closest to the simple, honest people who realize on an intuitive level that there is much within the world that they do not understand and never will.

Mundanes can be so cautious of the faeries' wrath, or so thoroughly frightened by the clergy's warnings, that they dare not set foot in dark woods or virgin mountains.</p> <p>Faerie power can also endure the presence of humans if tolerant relations are established between the two folk. Commoners and lowly faeries may even exchange goods or services; though to humans the trade may not seem equitable, it may be perfectly reasonable to the faerie mind.</p> <p>Inciting the wrath of faeries is to be avoided at all costs. Being completely wild, they adhere to no human or divine standard of morality. There's no evident rhyme or reason to the pain and torture they can inflict, and being eternal, they can hold grudges beyond mortal reckoning. Because faeries are so unpredictable, all relations with them are fraught with peril. Magi too would be wise to keep the peace with faeries, for not even Hermetic magic is a reliable defense.

To avoid this problem, you should think of grogs as the vibrant lower-class characters found in many Shakespearean plays. Their lives are often insignificant compared to those of the major figures, but their actions often reflect upon or even direct the basic themes and plot of the play. Yes, grogs are peripheral characters, but they're still a lot of fun to roleplay, just as Shakespeare's servants and guttersnipes are enjoyable to watch.</p> <p>The key to successfully portraying grogs is to emphasize the extremes. Just as they work and live hard, they play hard\u2014drinking is a favorite pastime for all medieval folk. They live menial lives, so often complain about their fate.

The storyguide secretly rolls a simple die; the number rolled is a multiple to the spell's normal duration.</p> <p>Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic: You can do more with spontaneous magic than most magi at the cost of your own life energy. When you decide to exert yourself in casting a spontaneous spell, you declare the level of effect you wish to produce before rolling. Make your casting roll as normal, adding all the appropriate modifiers and dividing by two. If your result is higher than the level you declared, you spend only one Fatigue Level as usual. If your result is less than the level you declared, you must expend one Body level per five points (or fraction thereof) you missed the target level by.

As such, you are very proficient in working with any of the natural elements of air, earth, fire, and water. You automatically gain Affinity with Elements (see page 34), which applies to all rolls involving Auram, Aquam, Ignem, and Terram. Due to your exotic training, however, your ties to Hermetic magic are weak. You have a Major Magic Deficiency in the Form of Vim (see page 35), and all rolls to cast formulaic spells that don't deal with the elements are at a penalty equal to your Affinity with Elements score. Furthermore, you are unable to cast any ritual spells, save those that specifically and concretely involve elements. This Virtue prevents you from having any other Magical Affinities.</p> <p>Silent Magic: You may cast spells without speaking, at no penalty. You do not benefit from using your normal voice.</p> <p>Variable Flaws</p> <p>Cyclic Magic (negative): As with the variable Hermetic Virtue, your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature and is less potent at specific times. This Flaw yields two points for each -3 penalty to spell-casting rolls at the peak of the cycle. The length of time during which you are at a disadvantage must be equal to the time when there is no penalty.</p> <p>Deleterious Circumstances: Your magic is restricted in certain situations.

Subtract the chosen cost of this Flaw from every roll that you make to cast formulaic spells.</p> <p>-1 Flaws</p> <p>Blatant Gift: People immediately realize that there is something strange about you, even if they do not know you are a magus. Animals are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by your presence.

You receive -3 on Lab Totals when you invent new spells, craft magic items, and make potions, unless you are working from a lab text. If you experiment, rolls twice as many dice on the experimentation table.</p> <p>Disjointed Magic: You cannot use previous knowledge to help you with magic. You gain no benefit from knowing a spell that is similar to one you are learning or inventing, and you gain no enchantment bonuses from Techniques and Forms already invested in an item.</p> <p>Flawed Parma Magica: Your Parma Magica (a ritual of protection against spells) is defective and provides only half the normal magic resistance against a certain Form. You may purchase this Flaw more than once for different Forms.</p> <p>Follower of Verditius (Verditius only): See page 26.</p> <p>Hedge Wizard: Because of your esoteric magic, other magi distrust you, and more importantly, grant you no respect. You start with a negative Reputation within the Order of Hermes at level 3 as a hedge wizard, even though you are a member of the Order.</p> <p>Incompatible Arts: For some reason you are completely unable to use one or more combinations of Techniques and Forms (except for Vim and Corpus).

Most magi expect little better from you. Even if you've done nothing wrong, you are treated as though you don't deserve to be a member of the Order. You have a bad Reputation of the appropriate type at level 3 among magi.</p> <p>Loose Magic: You lack the concentration, will, or ability to Master spells.</p> <p>Necessary Condition: In order for your magic to work, you must perform a specific action while casting any spell. This should be something simple, such as singing or spinning around three times.</p> <p>No Familiar (Bjornaer Only): Because of a flaw in your magic or nature, it is impossible for you to create the mystic cords that bind you to a familiar. Magi of houses other than Bjornaer may take this Flaw with the permission of the Storyguide.</p> <p>No Sigil (Tremere Only): See page 25.</p> <p>Poor Reader: You don't like to read, and don't read very well.

You get a \u20136 penalty to Lab Totals when learning spells or when working from the lab texts of others.</p> <p>Tormenting Master: Your master does not believe you have successfully passed the apprentice's gauntlet (the test of becoming a magus). He periodically troubles you with political moves and indirect attacks.</p> <p>Twilight Points: During apprenticeship you suffered an encounter with wild, strong magic that sent you into Wizard's Twilight (see page 182). The nature of the experience is important, as any future Twilight episodes will likely be related to the first. Consult with the storyguide to determine the exact nature and effect of the experience\u2014both the number of Twilight points you have sustained as well as any effects you suffered. As this is a Flaw, good effects should not be generated from the Twilight encounter.</p> <p>Unimaginative Learner: You have trouble figuring things out for yourself. Subtract one from rolls when you study from raw vis (before multiplication).</p> <p>Vis Obligation: You must pay someone four pawns of vis a year, independent of any other obligation your covenant may have. Failing to pay your debt may lead to very serious consequences, such as Hermetic punishment. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Flaw based on the availability of vis in the Saga.</p> <p>Warped Magic: Your magic is accompanied by some unpleasant side effect that always manifests itself the same way, but with increasing intensity according to the level of the spell. Examples include nearby items become hot or nearby plant matter becomes shriveled and wilted. This effect may cause trouble from time to time, but is usually just annoying.</p> <p>Weak Writer: You write about magic slowly and methodically. You copy spells from your shorthand at (Scribe Latin x 10) levels per season, and copy (Scribe Latin x 30) levels of spells that have already been written out per season. You may only write summa up to one-third of your level in an Art of Knowledge, and write two levels less per season than normal. You copy summae at (Scribe + Dexterity) x 2 levels per season.</p> <p>-2 Flaws</p> <p>Clumsy Magic: You have trouble targeting your spells accurately. Any spell that requires a targeting roll to aim its effect is subject to disastrous failure: a roll of 0 is automatically a botch. You receive a \u20133 penalty to any rolls involving Finesse.</p> <p>Discredited Lineage: The quaesitores suspect your Hermetic line of some terrible crime such as diabolism or descent from House Diedne, and it's unlikely that your name will ever be cleared. They keep a close eye on everything you do or say. If wrongdoing takes place, you are the first they suspect. Should you ever be formally accused, people are likely to shoot first and ask questions later. The quaesitores also try very hard to keep members of your line from positions of authority. You have a bad Reputation of an appropriate type, level 4, among quaesitores.</p> <p>Lack Of Concentration: You are profoundly unable to focus your mind. You cannot possess the Concentration Ability and cannot cast ritual spells.</p> <p>Lack Of Control: After casting a spell, you must spend a round doing nothing but recovering your mental faculties.</p> <p>Limited Magic Resistance: You are less able to resist magic than other magi. You gain no bonus from your Form scores to magic resistance rolls, though if you are caught without your Parma Magica, you retain a magic resistance of 0. You are still entitled to a natural resistance roll if it is applicable to the spell.</p> <p>Rigid Magic: You cannot use vis when you cast spells. Thus, you cannot extend the duration or range of spells, increase your spell rolls, cast ritual magic, or create permanent effects. You can use vis in the laboratory.</p> <p>Short-Lived Magic: Your spells do not last as long as they should. Spells that should be permanent last a year; those of a year, a moon; those of a moon, only to the next sunrise or sundown; and those of a sun, merely Diameter. Diameter, Concentration, and Instant spells are not affected, nor are those whose duration is enhanced by vis.</p> <p>Slow Caster: Your magic requires more time to prepare and execute than that of other magi. Your formulaic spells take two rounds to cast; spontaneous spells also take two rounds unless you fast-cast. Ritual spells are performed as normal, since all magi must cast them slowly and carefully.</p> <p>Stingy Master: Your master trained you less thoroughly than most, so you have only 130 points to buy spells and 130 points to purchase Arts instead of the usual 150 for each.</p> <p>Weak Magic: You are particularly unskilled with a certain Art, making it difficult for you to overcome the natural and magic resistance of targets. When determining Penetration with that Art, halve your spellcasting roll. In addition, the target's Natural Resistance roll is at +3. The storyguide may disallow this Virtue for some Arts that rarely require penetration, or rarely call for natural resistance.</p> <p>-3 Flaws</p> <p>Magic Addiction: You crave the rush of casting and holding power over magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you have a difficult time stopping yourself from casting again and again until you drop from exhaustion. Whenever you use a stress die in spellcasting, you must, whether or not the spell succeeds, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll, against a target number of half the level of the spell (or, if you botched, the level you were attempting). If you fail, you must immediately either cast a Formulaic spell of at least the same level as the previous spell, or cast any spontaneous spell, expending</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-37/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 37","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER II CHARACTERS 37</p> <p>Fatigue. If you botch, you continue casting spells until you fall unconscious.</p> <p>Old: You started your apprenticeship late in life, or were held far too long by your master. Your age is 40 + Stamina, or higher if you wish. This means you may have to make rolls on the Aging chart (without the aid of a longevity potion) before play even begins. Your first year as a magus will probably be spent in creating your longevity potion.</p> <p>Painful Magic: Casting spells causes you to suffer the equivalent of one Body level in pain for each spell you cast. This reduces all your actions by the appropriate wound penalty, which is cumulative with any from actual injuries or fatigue (though you do not suffer any physical damage from pain). You recover these \"pain levels\" just like Fatigue levels.</p> <p>Study Requirement: You are unable to study magic (including spells, Arts, and enchanted items) from books or vis alone. You must study in the presence of the appropriate Art. For example, you need to sit next to a brook or pond to study Aquam, or a large fire to study Ignem. Growing things are good for Creo, decaying ones good for Perdo. As your knowledge grows, you need to work with larger and larger quantities. This may limit your ability to learn some Arts. For example, the volcano that you need to learn Ignem 20 may be too dangerous to work near. This is up to the storyguide to decide.</p> <p>Weak Parma Magica: Your Parma Magica offers no protection under relatively common circumstances which are fairly easy for an opponent to utilize, such as when you are wet or facing away from the caster of the spell. You would be well advised to keep your weakness from being discovered by too many potential enemies.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-37/#-4-flaws","title":"-4 Flaws","text":"<p>Chaotic Magic: Your magic is very wild.

When casting Formulaic spells or using vis, roll twice the normal number of botch dice. You may not Master spells.</p> <p>Susceptibility to Divine Power: You are especially sensitive to the Dominion and suffer twice the normal penalties (such as spell-casting modifiers and botch rolls) to your magic when in a divine aura.</p> <p>Susceptibility to Faerie Power: You are especially susceptible to the fey and their magic. Whenever you enter a faerie area, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than its aura rating to avoid becoming disoriented. In addition, your magic resistance score, including Parma Magica, against faerie magic is halved. If someone else uses their Parma Magica to protect you, their resistance is not affected and you benefit normally.</p> <p>Susceptibility to Infernal Power: You are especially vulnerable to the dark powers. Whenever you enter an area of infernal influence, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than the aura rating or become ill (-1 on all rolls).

For example, an Educated character with Intelligence +2 who takes this virtue twice must be at least 20 years old. See Magister in Artibus on page 38.</p> <p>Good Armaments: You can start with any standard armaments and one expensive weapon or piece of armor.</p> <p>Healer: You have an empathic understanding of how to aid the wounded, the sick, and the suffering. Add one third (round up) your Healer score to any Chirurgy or Medicine roll, and to the recovery rolls of anyone you tend regularly. You can also use this Ability to calm the grieving and to soothe pain. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Healer 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Heir: You have little power or wealth now, but you stand to inherit land and possibly money. You need do nothing special to remain in your position, but others may occasionally attempt to remove you from the line of succession\u2014one way or another. When you finally win your inheritance you gain its responsibilities as well, so your freedom may be restricted.</p> <p>Herbalism: You are skilled at releasing the inherent magical properties of plants for use in potions, elixirs, pastes, and powders. Herbalism is particularly suited for some purposes, so you get bonuses when making certain kinds of substances: poisons +5, antidotes +5, healing and health +5, and hallucinogens +3. You can also identify plants, know when to harvest them, and understand their special properties. Choosing this Virtue confers the Knowledge Herbalism 1, which can be improved as any other Knowledge.</p> <p>Higher Purpose: Let others concern themselves with petty matters, you have a nobler goal. This purpose should be altruistic, like freeing an oppressed people or bringing peace between the Order of Hermes and society. You gain +3 on Personality Trait rolls made to pursue your goal.</p> <p>Indentured Servant: You have a personal attendant to cater to your everyday needs and desires. The servant generally follows your commands but is not trained to fight and is not highly skilled, having experience points in Abilities equal to his age in years. If the term of service is limited, and you want the servant to remain, you should provide some strong motivation. If your servant ever dies, or ends his service, you have no replacement.</p> <p>Inspirational: You are a stirring speaker or a heroic figure, and can urge people to great efforts.

You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving sight, not including attacks with missile weapons.</p> <p>Large (companions and grogs): Your Size is +1 instead of 0. This gives you have an extra winded Fatigue level and an extra hurt Body level.</p> <p>Learn From Mistakes: You are able to improve a particular Ability through the expedient of repeated failure. The first time in a given story that you botch a roll or fail by exactly one point, you gain one experience point in the Ability. You may take this Virtue several times, once for each Ability chosen.</p> <p>Light Sleeper: You can wake up almost instantly when disturbed and can take action immediately once awake, without the usual penalties. The storyguide may also allow generous Perception rolls to see if noises wake you.</p> <p>Long-Winded: You can last longer when exerting yourself than most, and gain +3 on all your Fatigue rolls. This bonus does not apply to casting spells.</p> <p>Magic Sensitivity: You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical effects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from all natural resistance and magic resistance rolls you make. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Magic Sensitivity 1, which can be improved as other Talents. When attempting to sense the magic nature of a place or object, the storyguide will assign an ease factor\u2014simply roll a simple die + Perception + Magic Sensitivity.</p> <p>Mimicry: You are able to imitate others' voices, as well as animal sounds. Mimicry is far from perfect, though, and you have to work hard to convincingly reproduce a specific person's voice: roll Mimicry + Communication of 9+. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Mimicry 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Perfect Balance: You are skilled at keeping your balance, especially on narrow ledges or tightropes. Add +6 to any roll to avoid falling or tripping.</p> <p>Premonitions: You intuitively sense whenever something is wrong, or is likely to go wrong soon. This Ability can be called upon by you or the storyguide, as appropriate, whenever there is a chance to avoid danger. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Premonitions 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Prestigious Family: Your family is well known and respected. When in dire need, others may help you because of your relatives, or your family itself may provide assistance. You begin the game with a Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who know your family.</p> <p>Rapid Convalescence: Your body can heal quickly. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to recover from wounds.</p> <p>Read Lips: You have a limited, self-taught Ability to understand the speech of people you cannot hear, simply by watching their mouths. This Ability is far from perfect, and you get many words confused: roll Read Lips + Perception of 9+ to be accurate in your interpretations. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Read Lips 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Reckless: You tend not to notice that situations are threatening. You start with a Personality Trait of Reckless +3, and can never have a positive Personality Trait reflecting care or patience. Whenever the storyguide deems it necessary for you to check bravery or a similar Personality Trait, make a roll against your Reckless score instead. A success means you do not realize your danger, and can act immediately without further checks.</p> <p>Second Sight: You are able to see ghosts, demons, and other invisible spirits. A roll of 9+ on Second Sight + Perception is usually</p> <p>successful, but your target may be higher or lower at the storyguide's discretion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Second Sight 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Secret Hiding Place: You know of a spot that is out of sight or just very difficult to get to, unknown to all but a few (or just yourself) and so is an excellent hiding place when you are in trouble. You may occasionally have problems getting there, but once hidden you are basically safe. However, there is always the risk that someone may find your hiding place, putting you in some kind of a predicament.</p> <p>Self-Confident: You have firm confidence in your own abilities. You begin the game with one extra Confidence point. You may take this Virtue up to three times, if you wish.</p> <p>Sense Holiness and Unholiness: You are able to feel the auras of good and evil. A Perception + Sense Holiness and Unholiness roll of 9+ lets you sense holiness or unholiness in a general area; 15+, in a person or object. In auras of particularly strong divine or infernal influence, your sensitivity may overwhelm you. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Sense Holiness and Unholiness 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Sharp Ears: You hear better than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving hearing.</p> <p>Social Contacts: You have a broad range of acquaintances in a specific social circle (specified when this Virtue is purchased), accumulated over years of travel and socializing. Almost everywhere you go, you meet someone you know, or can get in touch with someone who can help you. Whenever you are somewhere new, you can contact someone on a simple Presence roll of 6+. The storyguide may modify this target number upward for very small areas or areas where it is extremely unlikely that you would know someone. You may purchase this Virtue more than once, each time specifying a different social group.</p> <p>Strong Personality: For any three Personality Traits, you may have scores from -6 to +6 instead of the usual -3 to +3.</p> <p>Strong-Willed: You cannot easily be coerced into activities, beliefs, or feelings. You get +3 on any roll which may require strength of will.</p> <p>Tough: You can take physical punishment better than most people. You get a +3 bonus on your Soak score.</p> <p>Troupe Upbringing: You were raised among a group of entertainers, spending much of your childhood traveling from town to town. Rolls involving Performance Skills and Physical Talents in a selected area (which you should have approved by the storyguide) receive a +3 modifier. Examples might include tumbling and acrobatics, knife throwing and juggling, or storytelling and acting.</p> <p>True Friend: You have a very close friend who is your confidant, supporter, and ally in all things. The two of you do not hesitate to help the other, and you do not question each other's needs. Friendship brings obligations as well as benefits\u2014if anything bad happens to your friend, you are distraught (and, if appropriate, vengeful). You and your friend both have a Personality Trait of Loyal +3 to each other.</p> <p>Venus' Blessing: People are often attracted to you. You get +3 on Communication and Presence rolls with sexually compatible characters in appropriate situations. At times you can put this to good use. At other times it's an annoyance.</p> <p>Versatile Sleeper: You can fall asleep at will, anywhere, anytime, enjoying sleep whenever you have a few minutes. Thus, each day you get the equivalent of a full night's rest without having to spend the night in unbroken slumber. You can be awakened normally when napping.</p> <p>Veteran: You spent at least two years campaigning, perhaps on one of the Crusades. During that time, you improved your martial skills to some extent. You may spend seven experience points on Weapon Class Abilities, or any other Abilities that your storyguide</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-43/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 43","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER II CHARACTERS 43</p> <p>approves of that you might have learned or improved while campaigning. You may take this virtue more than once.</p> <p>Weather Sense: You are in tune with the subtle nuances of the weather. On a roll of Weather Sense + Perception of 9+, you can sense what the weather will be like the next day, or sooner if conditions are rapidly changing. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Weather Sense 1, which can be improved as other Talents.</p> <p>Well-Known: You have a good Reputation, level 2, in a particular area near the covenant, and are generally well liked.</p> <p>Well-Traveled: You have journeyed extensively in this part of the world and find it easy to get along with people throughout the area. You are familiar with regional dialects and can pick others up quickly, giving you +3 to appropriate speaking rolls. In addition you know something of local habits and traditions, giving you get a +3 bonus to appropriate Knowledge rolls, such as Legend Lore.</p> <p>+2 Virtues</p> <p>Blackmail: You have information that some powerful person would prefer kept hidden. You receive payments or services in return for your silence, and you may occasionally demand special favors. Don't push your luck\u2014your victim may decide it isn't worth the cost, or silence you permanently. This benefit has a yearly value of about 50 silver pennies, possibly more if you keep the pressure on. You should detail and record the specifics of this arrangement.</p> <p>Enchanting Music: When you set your mind to it, you can influence others in a specific way with your music. For a specific effect, you must sing words that people can understand. You can calm the grieving with tunes alone, but you need lyrics to convince peasants to rise up against the local lord. When you use Enchanting Music, roll a die (stress or simple, depending on the situation) and add Communication and Enchanting Music. A roll 9+ will calm the upset, a 12+ will win someone's love, a 15+ will incite a riot, an 18+ will touch the heart of a Magus, and a 24+ might win back a soul from the Prince of Darkness. If you botch, you inspire an unwanted emotion. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Enchanting Music 1, which can be improved as other talents.</p> <p>Faerie Friend: You have an ally among the fey. How much assistance you can get depends on the power of the friend\u2014a small faerie with (relatively) minor powers can accompany you on a day to day basis. Powerful faeries have other business, and may only be available to answer questions and provide guidance, not to accompany you around on your adventures. Your ally is fully sentient, has its own powers, and can speak when it chooses. You may want to have another player act the part. While a faerie companion can be a great boon, it can also be a terrible burden. If it is nasty or mischievous, it could cause trouble for you everywhere. Characters with this Virtue can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.</p> <p>Famous: You have a good Reputation, level 4, in the area surrounding the covenant. You should detail the noteworthy deeds you performed to earn this fame.</p> <p>Gossip: You have regular social contacts in the area that provide you with all kinds of information about local social and political goings-on. On a simple roll of 6+, you hear interesting news before almost everyone else. You treat all local Reputations as twice their actual level. With some well-placed words, you may be able to bestow new Reputations (whether deserved or not). You quite likely have a Reputation too\u2014as a gossip.</p> <p>Great (Characteristic): You may raise any Characteristic from +3 to +4. Make sure you describe what it is about you that causes that increase (such as sheer bulk, a lean build, or extreme charisma).</p> <p>Hex: You have the power to bring injury or ruin to your enemies. You must wish a specific calamity upon a person by cursing him aloud, and the storyguide (based on a stress die roll modified only by your Hex score) determines whether you succeed. Example target numbers are 9+ to cause a calf to be born with three legs, 15+ to bring a debilitating illness in the victim's family, or 21+ to cause the victim to be killed in a strange accident. Assuming the roll is successful, the hex strikes your victim anywhere from a day to a month later. Divine power or magic might offer protection, but a hex can often bypass this by affecting the victim indirectly. Sometimes the Church punishes those whose curses are widely known to have come true. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Hex 1, which can be improved with experience points.</p> <p>Indulgences: You have a number of indulgences (remissions of sin), which have been bestowed upon you by the Pope. You may sell these, keeping some money for yourself, or you may grant them to individuals in return for \"services to the Church\" (that is, doing something for you). Each indulgence confirms the remission of one sin, and you can have no more than 20 at any time (roll two dice). When all have been granted or sold, you may purchase more by returning to Rome.</p> <p>Intuition: You have a natural sensitivity that allows you to make the right decisions more often than luck can account for. Whenever you are given a choice in which luck plays a major role (such as deciding which of three unexplored paths to follow), you have a good chance of choosing correctly. The storyguide should secretly roll a simple die. On a 6+, your intuition kicks in and you make what ever might be considered the \"right\" decision. Otherwise, you fail to get any flash of insight and must make the decision without aid.</p> <p>Jack-of-All-Trades: Despite your lack of training, you can attempt things that others equally unskilled would find more difficult. You suffer no penalties to rolls against a Skill in which you have no score, provided you have some time to consider what you are about to do. (There is normally a -3 penalty to use Abilities you do not possess.) Skills that are exclusive to a particular group (such as Hermetic Skills to magi) are still beyond you, unless you belong to the appropriate group.</p> <p>Training: You have access to a trainer who has a score of 6 in three different Ability Scores, and can teach you during one season each year. This trainer has a +1 Communication. Determine the specifics of the individual and the relationship with your storyguide. You may have to travel to get training, but do not have to pay or provide services in return for it.</p> <p>Latent Magic Ability: You have a magical quality that has not yet manifested itself. You probably do not realize you have this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguide's discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine).</p> <p>Lightning Reflexes: You respond to surprises almost instantly. In fact, your reflexes are sometimes so fast that you don't have a chance to think about how you are going to respond. Whenever you are surprised or startled, roll a stress die + Quickness. If you get a 3 or better, you respond reflexively. You must tell the storyguide what one type of action (attacking, blocking, running, etc.) you would like to respond with. If attacking in response, you gain +9 to your Initiative Total. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what happens (though it is always in the best interests of your immediate self-preservation). You only react to threats that you are not fully aware of, so you don't get a bonus against an assassin you watch sneak up on you. Note that you do not get a choice about whether to react. You could just as easily skewer a friend sneaking up in fun as you would an assassin about to strike. Also note that you must perceive an action to react to it\u2014you can still be easily killed in your sleep. This Virtue gives you no special powers of perception.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-44/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 44","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>ARS MAGICA</p> <p>THE ART OF MAGIC</p> <p>Light Touch: You have especially good hand-eye coordination and great proficiency for using your hands in precise, fast ways. You gain +3 to all rolls involving subtle manipulation of objects (like picking pockets) and roll one less botch die than you normally would in such activities (minimum of one). This bonus does not apply to archery.</p> <p>Luck: You perform well in situations where luck is more of a factor than skill or talent. You get +1 to +3 (storyguide's discretion) on rolls in such situations, depending upon how much luck is involved. You do well at games of chance, but may be labeled a cheater if you play them too often.</p> <p>Magical Animal Companion: You are accompanied by a magical animal that's smart enough to follow your orders. The smaller and more innocuous the creature, the more intelligent it is. A ferret or crow is as intelligent as a human, a wolf is very cunning, and an animal the size of a horse is simply more intelligent than normal. If you wish, you may give your magical companion up to two points of Virtues, balanced with one Flaw point of your own. The creature has a Magic Might score of 10 - Size.</p> <p>Mentor: A person of some importance, wealth, or wisdom has taken an interest in your life, and at times provides you with material aid and advice. However, at some point your mentor may have a small favor to ask of you. He might not necessarily like your relationship with the covenant\u2014perhaps you must keep it a secret.</p> <p>Patron: An influential person provides you with materials and a handsome (by medieval standards) salary, in return for services of some kind. The relationship with your patron is one of business more than friendship, and you may occasionally have to walk on eggshells to avoid any unacceptable behavior, whether real or imagined.</p> <p>Piercing Gaze: By staring intently at people you make them feel uneasy, as if you are peering into their souls. Those with ulterior motives, uneasy consciences, or lying tongues must make rolls against an appropriate Personality Trait, Guile, or whatever the storyguide deems appropriate, to remain calm. Furthermore, you gain a +3 to rolls involving intimidation. Faeries and demons are unfazed by your power.</p> <p>Reserves of Strength: Once per day, when in need, you can perform an incredible feat of strength. For the duration of the action, add +3 to your effective Strength score. Afterwards, though, you must make two Fatigue rolls.</p> <p>Skinchanger: You have a magical cloak, animal skin or similar item made from an animal. While in physical contact with it, you may transform into the form of the animal represented by the item. The transformation takes one full round, and you retain both intelligence and sentience while in animal form. Clothing and possessions (save the animal item) do not transform, and you may be seen as a transformed human with InIm 20 or similar spells. If the item is stolen, the new owner has a arcane connection to you, and you may not transform until the item is retrieved. Skinchangers may transform into any nonmagical animal between Size -5 (robin) and Size +2 (bear). The character has the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 252), except that +3 is added to the character's Soak score (in animal form only).</p> <p>Superior Armaments: You can start with expensive arms and armor.</p> <p>Temporal Influence: Through blood or a position of trust, you enjoy some political weight in society. You have the ear of a leader and may yourself lead common folk at times, if they respect your position. The more influence you have, the more responsibility, and the harder it is to work unopposed with magi.</p> <p>True Love: You have found the one person meant for you in all of creation, and the bond between the two of you cannot be sundered. Whenever you are suffering, in danger, or dejected, the thought of your love will give you strength to persevere. Thus, you may add +3 to appropriate Personality Trait rolls, and add additional bonuses as</p> <p>allowed by the storyteller (never in excess of +3) to activities that will return you to your love, or save her life. In dire need, she may even come to rescue you. On the other hand, you are tied to your lover, to whom you must return frequently. If you do not, you may suffer penalties to most actions requiring spirit due to melancholy. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it.</p> <p>Visions: You often see images related to emotionally or magically laden events. A vision might be of the past, a possible future, or a distant occurrence, and is often symbolic or confusing. Visions usually come to you at quiet times in places connected with a powerful emotional or magical event, such as the site of a patricide or diabolic sacrifice. Choosing this Virtue confers the Talent Visions 1, which can be improved with experience points. When you wish to use this Talent, you tell the storyguide what specifically you would like to have a vision regarding. The storyguide assigns an ease factor based on the difficulty of gaining information about the topic. The storyguide should then make the roll in secret\u2014on a botch, incorrect information is divulged.</p> <p>Withstand Magic (companions and grogs): You are innately nonmagical and can resist many spell effects. You have a +6 bonus to natural resistance rolls against spells, faerie powers, and infernal powers. This bonus also applies to your Soak score against damage from spells. You resist good magic as well, and suffer a -6 penalty on any roll to determine if a beneficial spell (like healing) affects you. This Virtue does not apply to the effects of Exceptional Talents, nor does it protect against powers of the Dominion. You can have no magical powers.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-45/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 45","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER II CHARACTERS 45</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-45/#3-virtues","title":"+3 Virtues","text":"<p>Charmed Life: Fortune protects you from the most terrible injury and harm.

The storyguide should also be lenient where there is a chance of your rescue or protection.</p> <p>Fast Learner (companions and grogs): You get an extra experience point per story and per year (allotted during the summer) because of your ability to pick up knowledge faster than normal. You begin the game with 10 extra experience points to use in purchasing Abilities. The storyguide may wish to adjust the value of this Virtue\u2014it is much more useful in decade- or century-spanning sagas than it is in more short-lived ones.</p> <p>Giant Blood (companions and grogs): The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2. You gain two additional hurt Body levels and winded Fatigue levels.</p> <p>Guardian Angel: You have learned to hear the words of a divine watcher who gives you practical and spiritual advice. The angel whispers in your ear and tells you what is best for you spiritually, rather than materially. It approves of violence only when there is a holy reason\u2014often difficult to demonstrate. If you act against the angel's advice, it may leave you until you correct your ways. Your guardian angel may help you by bestowing +3 to rolls when you are resisting infernal powers, depending on the current state of your soul.

Those who know of your favored status treat you carefully; those who do not often pay the price. You have a Reputation (good or bad, your choice) of level 3, which could be higher if your protector is particularly great or well-known.</p> <p>Relic: You own a holy relic, such as the finger bone of a saint, with one Faith point in it. This can be built into any other item you possess (a sword, for instance).</p> <p>True Faith: Through piety and holy devotion you have faith that can move mountains. You have one Faith point and can gain more. For more about Faith points, see page 244.</p> <p>Visual Eidetic Memory: You remember everything you see as vivid images, giving you an increased chance to recall things and visualize them precisely. You gain +3 to all Intelligence rolls to remember a scene; if successful, you get another roll at an additional +3 (+6 total) to recollect all but the slightest of details.</p> <p>Wealth: You own land and other valuable things, and have a yearly income of about 700 silver pennies.

If an untimely demise ever threatens the fulfillment of your purpose, then something, somehow, will likely preserve you. You will meet your fate at the proper time, though it may cost you your life. You must have the approval of your storyguide to select this Virtue.</p> <p>Divination: Divination involves divining the nature, location, and possible futures of people, places, objects, and events through a variety of methods. This Virtue grants you the Exceptional Talent Divination at level 1, which can be improved with experience. Numerous types of divination existed in the 13th Century. This talent gives a character knowledge of only a specific type of divination. Common forms of divination in this era include astrology, analyzing dreams, gazing into fires, crystals, or mirrors, and reading the entrails of animals. Each variety of divination gives similar results, but each requires its own special preparations which must be performed in order to divine effectively. To ask a question the diviner must make a stress roll adding Divination and Intelligence; the result must equal the level of difficulty for the question being asked.</p> <p>Examples of sample questions with their levels of difficulty are listed below. Note that divination does not imply predestination. A correct reading about the future will only give you the most likely of all of the possible futures.</p> Roll Required Nature of Question 9+ Answer one question about a distant person's current fate. 9+ Answer one question about an object which is present. 12+ Determine the location or fate of a distant object. 12+ Determine the basic character of a person 15+ Determine auspicious and inauspicious days and times for performing a given endeavor * 18+ Determine some important piece of information about the possible future of an individual 18+ Determine the likely course of a planned endeavor <p>*If the diviner successfully determines the best day and time for a single endeavor which takes place in a limited time frame (not more than a day) and requires a single roll (for example, looking for a lost treasure, asking a favor of the king, or playing a game of chess with death), then the diviner rolls a simple die, and compares it with the following: 1-6: +3, 7-9: +6, 10: +9. The bonus determined is then added to the roll in question, provided that the endeavor is undertaken at the proper time. The storyguide decides how far into the future the divined time is.</p> <p>If the endeavor is a long one requiring numerous rolls, like fighting a battle, going on a journey, or slaying a dragon, a successful divination roll gives a +1 to all rolls directly concerning this endeavor. If the diviner botches the roll to determine an auspicious day and time, then they have inadvertently determined the worst possible time for such an endeavor, and all the bonuses listed above are treated as penalties.</p> <p>Entrancement: You have the power to control another's will. By staring deeply into someone's eyes for several seconds\u2014generally impossible in combat\u2014you can verbally command the person to perform a certain task. Roll Presence + Entrancement against the target's Stamina roll. The person being controlled may get a bonus to resist at the option of the storyguide, according the table below.

It might be a grandparent, a childhood friend, or anyone else who cares for you enough to stay around after death. The ghost is invisible and silent to all but you and those with Second Sight (see page 42). It can see and hear what is going on around you and makes an excellent spy, since it can leave your presence once per day for up to half an hour. However, death does not leave people in their normal state of mind, so the ghost probably has some quirks that make it less than dependable\u2014it might even encourage you to join it on the other side. The ghost has 20 experience points in various Abilities that it can use to advise you.</p> <p>Incredible (Characteristic): You have an incredible capacity in one of your Characteristics, raising it from +3 to +5. Describe what it is about you that causes the increase (such as sheer bulk, lean muscles, or extreme charisma).</p> <p>Magic Resistance: You have an innate immunity to magical effects and may possess some unusual physical sign, such as a birthmark or iron fingernails.

Armaments so mended can only receive +1 bonuses, at most.</p> <p>Ways Of The (Land): You have a deep understanding of a type of terrain, feeling more natural and at home there than anywhere else. Examples include Ways of the Forest, Ways of the Mountain, or Ways of the Steppe. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls that directly involve that area and its inhabitants; mundane, magical, or faerie. In addition, you roll one less botch die than normal (but always at least one) in rolls that pertain to your area of understanding. You are not normally molested by animals of the terrain, and though particularly vicious creatures may still attack you, at least they\u2019ll accord you proper respect.

The severity of the curse determines the number of Flaw points: in general, the more intense or commonly manifested the effect, the higher the point value. Example \u20131 Curses: everything you say is taken in the worst possible way, or a live toad appears in your mouth when you speak a direct lie. Example \u20132 Curses: you stutter uncontrollably when you try to say something important, or if you ever tell a secret that was entrusted to you, the secret somehow harms you. Example \u20133 Curses: you are pained by light, with greater light bringing greater pain, or you see shapes and phantoms in the night that terrify and immobilize you. Example \u20134 Curses: you are doomed to be wounded in every battle you take part in (and in some that you try to avoid), or normal tools break whenever you use them.</p> <p>Enemies: Someone is causing trouble for you, such as a local baron or bishop, a band of outlaws, or a really nasty innkeeper. The enemy must be powerful enough to endanger you\u2014this is best agreed on with the storyguide and the rest of the troupe. The value for a local enemy with moderate means is \u20131. Vastly powerful enemies with considerable means and spare time to spend making your life miserable are worth up to \u20134.</p> <p>Outsider: You belong to a group that is both readily identifiable and distrusted or disliked. Examples include Saracens, Jews, and Moors. You are shunned and often persecuted because of this, and your life and freedom may occasionally be in peril. You have a bad Reputation of level 1 to 3 (depending upon how easy it is to identify you) among members of the dominant social group of your area. There is no way for you to ever remove that stain, and you are marked by it wherever you go. The cost of this Flaw is equal to the Reputation that it causes.</p> <p>Vow: You have sworn to do something difficult, and breaking your vow is a serious matter. Examples vows include never raising a weapon, never speaking, or living in poverty. If you do fail to uphold your vow, you must perform some kind of atonement, whether it be religious penance or coming to terms with your failure in some other way. Furthermore, you lose one point of Confidence. Depending on your vow, some people may respect your dedication, giving you a good Reputation of level 1 among those people.

Examples include drinking, sex, perfection, bragging, or gambling. You may take this Flaw more than once.</p> <p>Dark Secret: You are haunted by something that would lead to shame, rejection, and possibly revenge if discovered. Hints about the secret continually arise, and there might be others who know it and could betray you. This makes you avoid certain places, dislike certain people, or fear certain things.</p> <p>Deep Sleeper: When you sleep, you don't go halfway. You can sleep through loud noises and generally only wake up when shaken, or when good and ready. Even then you suffer -3 on your rolls for half an hour or so after awakening, and you're likely to head back to bed if at all possible.</p> <p>Delusion: You believe wholeheartedly in something that just isn't so. Examples include that you are a magus (if you are not), that you are the Pope's child, or that your imaginary friend is real. This can cause real problems for you and your associates.</p> <p>Dependent: You are responsible for someone, like a young child or a decrepit grandparent. This restricts your freedom and time in a variety of ways, which may change with time\u2014a child grows up and moves away, a grandparent gets seriously ill and requires constant care. You may take this Flaw repeatedly to reflect several dependents.</p> <p>Disfigured: A visible disfigurement makes you ugly and easy to recognize. Presence rolls that involve good looks and gaining respect from most people are at -3. You probably have a cruel nickname that refers to your unfortunate appearance.</p> <p>Driving Goal: You have some personal objective that you feel compelled to attain, even if it gets you into trouble or jeopardizes the group. Such goals are ideal or open-ended\u2014you can never finally accomplish them. Examples include freeing peasants from oppression, harassing and killing Norman warriors, or amassing vast amounts of personal wealth. You may take this flaw more than once.</p> <p>Dutybound: You adhere to a restrictive code of conduct that forbids certain behavior, probably including prohibitions against lying, killing prisoners, stealing, and other occasionally useful actions. You follow this code out of guilt or fear rather than high-flown moral standards, and may spend more time justifying yourself than keeping your conduct pure.</p> <p>Evil Eye: One of your eyes is misshapen, causing your face to have a frightening appearance. People generally regard you as evil, and hide their children's faces from your gaze. You are at a -3 when dealing with mundanes in any social setting, in addition to any penalty you may have for the Gift.</p> <p>Expenses: You must pay a significant portion of your wealth and income (25% - 50%) to a person or organization, or devote it to expenses that bring you no personal gain. Failure to pay your dues brings unpleasant consequences, such as the loss of privileges or the ill will of an important person.</p> <p>Faerie Enmity: Faeries dislike you and take every opportunity to pester you. Faerie forests are extremely dangerous, but even field faeries may spoil your food, plague your dreams, or otherwise torment you. Luckily, your life is not in danger\u2014they prefer to let you live so they can continue to harass you.</p> <p>Favors: You owe a boon to someone (or to a great many people), and may be called upon to return the favor at any time. The consequences of ignoring such a request can range from mild to deadly serious, at the storyguide's discretion.</p> <p>Fragile Constitution: You are sickly and weak. You suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls to recover from wounds and diseases.</p> <p>Hatred: You are consumed with hatred for some person who is so powerful that exacting proper vengeance is impractical or impossible. Nevertheless, you constantly pursue opportunities to gain power over or hurt the object of your hatred, so much so that your reason is clouded.</p> <p>Hunchback (magi): You have a deformed body that gives you a grotesque appearance and hinders your movements. You are at a -3 to all rolls involving agility and balance. Presence rolls that involve good looks are at a -3.</p> <p>Infamous Family: Your family is very well known, but not very well liked. You have a bad Reputation at level 3 among those who know your family, and have a particularly hard time losing it because it applies to the whole family, not just you. You have trouble trusting others because the community has always acted against you.</p> <p>Judged Unfairly: Somehow you come across the wrong way to people, and they universally distrust and underestimate you. You catch no one's eye, impress no one, and can get no one to take you seriously. If you ever find an exceptional someone who sees you as you want to be seen, you will cling to that person.</p> <p>Lost Love: You have lost your true love to death, distance, or marriage. You take little joy in life's pleasures and give up easily in the face of difficulty, since you've already lost the most important struggle. On those occasions when you forget yourself and have a good time, you inevitably feel sorrow afterwards, thinking about how it could have been if your love were with you.</p> <p>Low Self-Esteem: You have a deflated opinion of your own self-worth. You begin the game with only 2 Confidence points.</p> <p>Magical Air (companions and grogs only): Although you do not have the Gift, you look and act like a magical person. This can be detrimental when dealing with mundane society\u2014you suffer the same -3 penalty to social interaction rolls as magi.</p> <p>Magic Susceptibility: You are easily affected by magic. You suffer a -3 penalty on all magic resistance and natural resistance rolls, and get -3 to Soak against direct magical damage. However, you receive a +3 bonus when rolling for the effects of beneficial magic.</p> <p>Meddler: You want to fix other peoples' lives: arrange matches, teach children to sew \"properly,\" or tend the sick. You waste a lot of time and energy on such endeavors, and people usually resent it. You have a Personality Trait of Meddlesome +3 and a bad Reputation, level 1, as a meddler. If you are a magus, you probably interfere in the affairs of other magi, companions, and apprentices. You don't violate Hermetic law, but you probably come close\u2014and you almost certainly irritate the other magi of your covenant.</p> <p>Missing Ear: You cannot accurately locate the direction of sounds, and suffer a penalty of -3 to hearing rolls.</p> <p>Missing Eye: You cannot judge close distances easily and get -3 on Attack rolls for missiles. In melee combat you suffer -1 on Attack rolls because your field of vision is limited. You also have a blind side from which people can approach unseen. This Flaw can be combined with Poor Eyesight (below), but the penalties are cumulative.</p> <p>Oath of Fealty: You owe one season of service each year to someone or some organization outside the covenant. Additionally, you must justify your actions to those persons, and sometimes there is a conflict between your oath and your activities in the covenant. Magi are forbidden from taking Oaths of Fealty by the Hermetic Code.</p> <p>Obese: You are large because of fat, not muscle. You are at -1 to all rolls that involve moving quickly or gracefully and at -3 to all Fatigue rolls. Your Size is +1, and so you gain one Hurt Body level. You do not gain an extra Fatigue level.</p> <p>Obligation (companions and grogs): You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-48/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 48","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>ARS MAGICA</p> <p>THE ART OF MAGIC</p> <p>Obsessed: You are fixated on some prized object, action, or ideal. This interferes with your accomplishment of more immediate tasks. Examples might include obsessive protection of magi to the point that you attack those who insult them, or obsessive neatness where you keep yourself spotless and deride those who do not.</p> <p>Offensive To Animals: (companions and grogs only): You are somehow disturbing to animals. Horses do not let you ride them, and dogs growl or cower in your presence. People may well suspect you of being a wizard or Devil-worshipper.</p> <p>Oversensitive: Something that others find merely unpleasant you consider intolerable. Examples might include an oversensitivity to disrespect, to slovenliness, or to impiety. If you are the violent type, you may start fights with those who offend you.</p> <p>Poor Armaments: You can only have inexpensive arms and armor, and can only have inexpensive equipment relevant to your occupation.</p> <p>Poor Eyesight: Bleary vision impedes your performance. Rolls involving sight, including rolls to attack and defend, are at $-3$. New environments are disorienting and perhaps frightening for you. This flaw can be combined with Missing Eye (above), but the penalties are cumulative.</p> <p>Poor Hearing: Subtract 3 from rolls involving hearing. Speech that is hard for others to understand because of language, dialect, or accent is almost impossible for you to follow. You often pretend to be listening to people when in fact you are not.</p> <p>Poor Memory (companions and grogs): You have a very hard time recalling one type of thing, such as names, faces, or places. When attempting to remember such an item, you must make a stress roll of $6+$ to succeed. You get $-3$ on any other memory-related rolls. On a botch, you recall incorrectly but are convinced you have the right information. For best effect, the storyguide should make recollection rolls secretly.</p> <p>Reclusive: You prefer to do things on your own, and do not like being interrupted. You feel that an intrusion by another upon your time is unnecessary at best, and an insult at worst. You have a Personality Trait of Reclusive $+3$. If someone interrupts you, make a stress roll against this Trait; on a $6+$, you rudely show them the door. If you botch, you lose your temper completely, while a multiple botch likely results in violence as you try to get rid of the pest.</p> <p>Short Attention Span (companions and grogs): You have trouble concentrating, which makes it hard to learn anything. You must earn double the normal experience points to raise your Knowledge Abilities, and expend twice as much to buy them in the first place. Keeping watch, listening to complex orders, following the plot of a story, or performing other such tasks that require continued attention are usually not within your ability.</p> <p>Simple-Minded: You can only think about one thing at a time\u2014guarding the bridge, hunting for a missing ring, or hiding in the trees for example. You become easily confused unless others give you very clear instructions. When unexpected circumstances pop up, you find them difficult to deal with.</p> <p>Social Handicap (companions and grogs): You have some trait that keeps you from interacting easily with other people. This impairs your dealings with most of society, causing penalties of $-3$ on appropriate rolls. Examples include morose temperament, unworldliness, an unpleasant odor, or outspoken atheism.</p> <p>Soft-Hearted: You cannot bear to witness suffering, and causing it brings you sleepless nights. Even the deaths of enemies are painful for you. You avoid danger and try to keep your friends out of it as well. Life and health mean so much that you would rather give up important goals than let another person risk combat. You are easily moved by song and story.</p> <p>Tainted With Evil (magi): An air of corruption surrounds you as a result of something you, your parens, or your ancestors did. Others naturally feel very ill at ease around you, and can easily grow to hate you. Gaining a positive Reputation is impossible. Magi do not react as strongly to this attribute as normal people.</p> <p>Uncommon Fear: Something that others find innocuous or even pleasant makes you nervous, edgy, and unable to concentrate. If you are prone to violence, you might respond by attacking or destroying the feared thing, but only if you cannot escape its presence. The object of your fear is not something you're likely to meet on a daily basis. Examples include wild animals, strange sounds, and clergy.</p> <p>Weakness: You have a soft spot for some object or person. In the face of this, all else is unimportant: promises are forgotten, duties neglected, and common sense cast to the winds. Examples include poets and storytellers, food, flattery, or a pretty face.</p> <p>Weak-Willed: You look to others for guidance rather than to yourself. Those who try to fool, intimidate, or manipulate you gain $+3$ to their rolls. What you need more than anything else is to find someone you can trust.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-48/#-2-flows","title":"-2 Flows","text":"<p>Clumsy: You are not very graceful and tend to drop things\u2014you are at a $-3$ in all related rolls.

Examples include fires, buildings, and the touch of others.</p> <p>Curse of Venus: You are very attractive to people whom you do not wish to attract (add +3 to Presence rolls). People you detest keep getting crushes on you, and will not be dissuaded. Furthermore, you tend to fall in love with inappropriate people, and in inappropriate circumstances. These people you are interested in tend to think you are vain and shallow, causing a \u20131 penalty on Presence and Communication rolls.</p> <p>Decrepit: You have one Decrepitude point (see page 181) from old wounds or a past serious illness.</p> <p>Diabolic Upbringing: Your parents were diabolists, and though you have escaped their evil ways, you are still haunted by your upbringing and the memory of acts best left unspoken. Thoughts of demons plague you, and you live in a constant state of dread and hatred. The powers of Hell might have a special interest in your soul. You may purchase the Knowledge Occult Lore, even if you are normally not permitted to buy Arcane Knowledges.</p> <p>Haunted: You are plagued by a ghost that only you (and those with Second Sight) can see and hear. It insults, berates, and distracts you\u2014especially when you need to keep your cool. It might steal and hide your smaller items, give others near you the chills, or cause a buzzing in your ears that prevents you from hearing clearly. In no case, however, does the ghost have any powers when more than seven paces away from you. The storyguide should use his imagination in making the ghost irritating but not fatal. Yelling can drive the ghost away for a time, but also confuses those around you. Unless you are exceptionally strong-willed, you might have to aid the ghost in its purpose in order to be rid of it. A magus with this Flaw is haunted by a particularly powerful ghost, and therefore has trouble controlling it even with spells. It also often interferes with magical research, giving \u20133 to all Lab Totals.</p> <p>Hunchback (companions and grogs): As per the \u20131 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.</p> <p>Infamous: People know you well and curse you in their prayers. You have a level 4 bad Reputation, specifying the horrible deeds that earned you such ill will.</p> <p>Lame: One of your legs is weakened, whether since birth or through some accident. You move slowly and clumsily. Your base speed is a mere one mile per hour, and anyone can outrun you. You suffer a \u20136 penalty on rolls involving moving quickly or with agility, \u20133 on Dodge, and \u20131 on other combat scores.</p> <p>Lycanthrope: You have been cursed to change form into a dangerous predator (such as a wolf, lynx, or bear) on nights of the full moon. No items or clothing transform between shapes, and it takes one full round for the full transformation to take effect. You are not immune to normal weapons, and the curse does not infect bite victims. The animal may be detected as a cursed human with a InIm 25 or equivalent spell.</p> <p>You have the intelligence of a animal while changed, react to all stimuli as an animal, and do not retain any memory of actions taken in animal form, save occasionally in dreams. You may not even realize that you are under this curse. You can still recognize both friends and enemies when changed.</p> <p>Lycanthropes may transform into any non-magical animal between Size \u20131 (wolf) and Size +2 (bear). You have the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 252), except that +3 is added to your Soak score (in animal form only). Furthermore, you are fully healed of all wounds incurred in animal form upon resuming human form (which happens at dawn).</p> <p>Missing Hand: Perhaps it was an accident or a punishment in your past that cost you one of your hands. Climbing, combat, and other activities normally requiring both hands are at a penalty of \u20133 or greater.</p> <p>Noncombatant (magi): You have no interest or ability in the fighting arts. You cannot learn any Weapon Skills, and suffer \u20133 on all Attack and Damage scores. You may not learn combat spells (defined at storyguide discretion). You cannot pick Virtues and Flaws relating to armament quality. You may learn and engage in cert\u00e1men.</p> <p>Obligation (magi): You are required to perform certain services for someone. These duties typically occupy at least one season out of every year, occasionally longer. This may be out of personal choice (like protecting a family member) or a true duty, like that of a knight to a lord. Whatever the nature of your services, failure to perform them may have serious or lasting consequences.</p> <p>Overconfident: You have an exaggerated and unshakable opinion of your capabilities, and you do not hesitate to try things that promise only defeat. If you are convincing in your speech, you can infect others with your overconfidence. You gain the Personality Trait Overconfident at +3.</p> <p>Poor: You have almost no wealth, and for some reason you can never seem to hang onto the valuables you do gain. You automatically begin the game with inexpensive arms and armor, and whenever you put your hands on something of value, you can bet you won\u2019t have it for long.</p> <p>Poor (Characteristic): You have an exceedingly bad Characteristic\u2014lower one which is already \u20133 to \u20134. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a feeble stature, hideous visage, or slack-jawed stupidity.</p> <p>Sheltered Upbringing: You grew up completely separated from society, knowing only your parents or mentor. Recently you have been introduced to a wondrous new world of strangers, and you are overwhelmed. Depending on your personality, you might react with contempt, fear, or wonder. You are unable to function normally because you cannot understand most human customs. You suffer a penalty of \u20133 to most tasks involving social interaction, and you may have no Social Talents or Skills as beginning Abilities. Eventually you may overcome your upbringing.</p> <p>Small Frame (companions and grogs): You are of a lighter-than-average build. Your Size is reduced by 1. You have no Hurt Body Level and no Winded Fatigue Level.</p> <p>Tainted With Evil (companions and grogs): As the \u20131 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above. Mundanes react much more strongly to your atmosphere of corruption.</p> <p>Terrors: Some specific thing fills you with overwhelming dread. You can do nothing but scramble and fight to flee its presence. If escape is impossible, you are likely to collapse into a quivering heap.

His imagination fell far short of the truth.</p> <p>Yesterday I was summoned again to the abbot, and Fulk was with him once more. The abbot seemed distracted, and told me that I was to leave the monastery and go with Fulk to his home. I was shocked, because the abbot has always preached firmly that monks must stay in their monasteries. I began to protest, but he stopped me, telling me that I was sworn to obedience. I left, but it was not true. I have not taken my vows yet. I could have disobeyed him and remained. Instead I left.</p> <p>Fulk spoke to me before I left the abbot, and told me that we would leave before dawn. I own nothing, and so brought nothing but my clothes and this book. Fulk met me in the cloister, and we left in the half dark. Fulk quickly led me away from the road, and I heard voices ahead, and saw a camp fire. Fulk led me to the top of a hill, and stood between me and the rising sun.</p> <p>\"Watch and learn,\" he said, \"for this is your destiny.\" I faced the old man, dressed in the plain white habit of the Cistercians, and for a moment nothing happened. As the sun rose above the horizon, a darkness spread through his robes, and through his hair, his skin became fair, and his body changed, and I thought that a demon had surely possessed him. Perhaps it had. The white habit of a monk became rich robes of deepest blue, decorated with shining silver, and I was frozen to the spot as ice seemed to clutch at my heart. The old man was gone, and a beautiful woman stood before me. The silence of that moment seemed to last forever, as she seemed to gather the disappearing darkness into herself.</p> <p>\"I am Julia, follower of Jerbiton, and I am your mistress.\" The words broke whatever spell held me there, and I turned to flee back to the monastery, but men from the camp had climbed up behind us, and one of them caught me.</p> <p>We walked all day, the warriors guarding me so that I could not flee, and Julia leading the way. We camped shortly before sunset, and I watched carefully to see if she would change back. She did not, only performing some ritual. Now, she watches me across the flames, and I see my soul in hell, watching her through the flames for eternity. Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.</p> <p>The Feast of Epiphany, in the year of our Lord twelve hundred.</p> <p>May our Lord Jesus Christ protect me, the Blessed Virgin Mary send angels to guard me, and Ailred of holy memory intercede for me, for I am in the den of vipers, yea, the very house of robbers.</p> <p>I am sitting in my room, which is lit by a fire which never goes out. The worm which never perishes will come for me when I sleep, for this is an unholy place, surely cut off from the love of God.</p> <p>It does not look like the mouth of Hell. It is a stone manor house, well built around three sides of a courtyard, the fourth side closed by a wall with a gate in it. Two towers rise from the rear corners, and there are people busy within it. It even looks something like a monastery, but without a chapel. There is no chapel, and no church in the village. Truly, all those here are lost, and I am among them.</p> <p>When we arrived it was clear that Julia had come home, for everyone rushed around to make her welcome. She sent a servant to summon a council, and led me to a large chamber in the rear of the house. In this room stood a large table, round like Arthur's, and she sat in a chair finer even than the abbot's, with her name carved on the back. She told me to stand behind her and keep silent. As I waited, the others came.</p> <p>The first was a man, small and thin, dressed in robes of deep red, the color of blood. He brought with him a smell of burning, and there was ash on his hands. The second was another woman, taller than Julia, and very pale, dressed entirely in white. Her cheeks and forehead were covered with scars in an intricate pattern, as were her hands. In one hand she held a dagger which glittered like ice, and she toyed with it throughout the council. They had entered through the door by which we had come, and I was sure then that I was in a house of demons.</p> <p>Then a bird, a raven, flew in through one of the windows and settled on another chair. In a moment it had changed to a man, small, with dark hair, who sat naked in the seat, staring at me with hungry eyes.</p> <p>One chair remained empty, and I fixed my eyes on it to avoid looking at the others, who were talking in Latin, too quietly for me to follow. As I watched, the final councilor appeared in the chair, appearing from nothing amid a stench of rotting flesh. He was robed in rough brown, and his face had the pallor of a corpse. I was about to run, but Julia had seized my wrist, and I found that I could not move. She spoke to the assembly.</p> <p>\"Sodales, this is William of York, my new apprentice. He is under my protection.\" I am sure that the raven looked disappointed at that.</p> <p>Then I was sent from the room, and guarded by two of the soldiers who had come with us from the monastery, until Julia emerged to lead me to my room.

You may only choose beginning Abilities that you could have learned in the wilds or picked up at the covenant (such as how to use a mace instead of a club). You have neither the inclination nor the capacity to learn more refined skills, and have no Speak or Scribe Own Language Ability.</p> <p>Fury: A violent temper sometimes overwhelms you, sending you into a destructive, uncontrollable rage. You are likely to be provoked by some sort of specific event, such as being insulted, being hurt, or hearing the Order of Hermes disparaged. Roll 9+ on a stress die to avoid flying into a rage when such an event occurs, with another roll every round to try to calm yourself should you fail the first. On a botch, you try to kill everyone around you. While enraged you get +3 to Damage, but -1 on all other scores and rolls.</p> <p>Mute (companions and grogs only): You cannot speak; perhaps your tongue was cut out. You probably use rudimentary hand gestures and grunts to communicate your needs. Not only is this inconvenient, it can annoy your companions.</p> <p>Noncombatant (companions and grogs): As per the -2 Flaw of the same name for magi, listed above.</p> <p>Sense of Doom: You have gained knowledge best left unknown\u2014perhaps a vision of your demise or eternal fate, perhaps secrets about your true nature. At times you are listless, as nothing can shake your feeling of impending doom. Whenever you are defeated in a meaningful attempt at something, you are incapable of taking any energetic action for up to a day. If forced to defend yourself during this time, you suffer -3 on all scores.</p> <p>Small Frame (magi): As per the -2 Flaw of the same name for companions and grogs.</p> <p>-4 Flaws</p> <p>Dwarf (companions): You are the size of a child. Your comfortable walking speed is two-thirds that of a normal person. Though your muscles are mature, you lack the leverage that benefits larger folk. Even if you are strong, this prevents you from using any weapons that require a positive Strength. Your Size is -2, so you have no Winded or Weary Fatigue Levels, and have no Hurt or Lightly Wounded Body Levels.</p> <p>Feeble (Characteristic): You are extremely disadvantaged in one of your Characteristics\u2014lower it from -3 to -5. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a ham-handed clumsiness, exceedingly disgusting appearance, or near-immobility.</p> <p>Plagued by (Supernatural Entity): You have somehow earned the enmity of a powerful ghost, an angel, a demon, or a very powerful faerie. The entity does not harass you constantly, but usually affects you in dangerous ways during important times of your life. When attempting to overcome its victim's Magic Resistance, the entity has +12 on its Penetration roll. The storyguide should decide on the nature and purpose of the entity's plans.</p> <p>-5 Flaws</p> <p>Age Quickly: Probably due to a curse or a magical disaster, you age twice as fast as normal people. Your effective age (which applies as if it were your actual age when making longevity potions) increases two years for every year that passes, and you make two aging rolls each year. There is no way to halt or slow this other than longevity potions, and even then two potions are required to modify both aging rolls.</p> <p>Blind (companions): You have little or no sight. Using missile weapons is futile, reading is impossible, and navigation in unknown territory is difficult to say the least.</p> <p>Dwarf (magi): As the -4 Flaw for companions and grogs.</p> <p>Enfeebled (companions): You cannot exert yourself for longer than a few seconds. Any need for rapid movement, such as combat or a chase, leaves you helpless. Long hikes are likewise beyond your capability. You are unable to learn Weapon Skills or any other skills involving physical exertion, since you cannot train in them.</p> <p>Pathetic (Characteristic): You are absolutely without redeeming value in the area of one of your Characteristics. Lower a Characteristic from -3 to -5. Furthermore, the storyguide, once per session of play, may maliciously initiate some misfortune related to your shortcoming, causing you injury or embarrassment. A character with pathetic Dexterity might accidentally fall down a well, or a character with pathetic Intelligence might unknowingly cut a deal with the enemy to turn the magi over to thieves. Describe what it is about you that makes you so pathetic.</p> <p>-6 Flaws</p> <p>Enfeebled (magi): As per the -5 Flaw of the same name for companions, listed above. In addition, you lose double Fatigue levels from casting spells.</p> <p>Poor Memory (magi): As per the -1 Flaw of the same name for companions, listed above. In addition, it takes you twice as long to learn spells. You begin the saga with half the normal spell levels.</p> <p>Abilities</p> <p>Abilities represent what a character can do beyond the basic functions described by Characteristics. They usually represent training or practice in the way that Characteristics represent innate capacity. Abilities are broken down into Skills, Talents, and Knowledges based on the different ways that they can be improved. Skills, Talents, and Knowledges are broken down further into related groups such as Arcane Skills or Formal Knowledges. Each Ability is assigned a score, representing the character's level of expertise. In general, an Ability score of 3 suggests basic competence, 5 represents professional mastery, and scores of 9 or higher suggest folk who are approaching the pinnacle of human knowledge and achievement.</p> <p>It is possible to gain special Abilities that are not mentioned specifically in these descriptions. These are referred to as Exceptional Abilities. Usually, they are gained by purchasing specific Virtues. They function and improve just like the Abilities listed here.

Generally you will add your character's score in the appropriate Ability to your score in one Characteristic to the roll of a die. Often times, other modifiers will also apply based on the specific circumstances of the action. The Characteristic chosen depends on how the Ability is used. For example, Athletics is usually used in combination with either Stamina, Dexterity, or Quickness. In a situation where your character is attempting to leap over a chasm, you would apply your Athletics score and your Dexterity score. On the other hand, when running a foot race, you would sum your Athletics and Quickness.</p> <p>The Storyguide determines the ease of success in given tasks by assigning ease factors. When using an Ability against a static force the ease factor is based on the difficulty of the task. For example, when attempting to pick a lock, the ease factor would be based on the quality of the lock. When the attempt is opposed by another person's actions both roll and compare results. The higher total usually wins, but the storyguide must take into account any other modifiers that apply, such as Encumbrance, Virtues and Flaws, or special circumstances.</p> <p>The storyguide decides whether the roll is a stress or simple die. If your character is feeling pressured and is likely to make mistakes or do exceptionally well as a result, the roll is stress. The storyguide can also set a minimum Ability score that must be met even to attempt certain rolls.</p> <p>You may not always be aware of the reasons for rolling, the modifiers to your rolls, or the results of success or failure. In situations where your character does not know what is going on, the storyguide may simply roll on your behalf and announce the results.</p> <p>If your character attempts an action covered by an Ability that he does not have, there are three possible procedures. For Talents (except Exceptional Talents\u2014see page 59), roll a stress die modified only by the appropriate Characteristic, with three additional botch dice if you roll a 0. For Skills, you receive a -3 penalty to your stress roll as well as three extra botch rolls. Where the action requires a Knowledge, you cannot even make the attempt.

Hence, Abilities are purchased on a pyramid system. In order to raise an Ability to the next level, you must pay a number of experience points equal to the score you wish to attain. For example, to raise a score of 0 to a score of 1 costs one experience point. To raise a score of 4 to a score of 5 requires five experience points. The Ability Cost Table below is a summary of this system, recording the total number of experience points required to bring your score from 0 to a given number.</p> <p>Be sure that the Abilities you choose make sense for your character's identity, especially those related to his profession, background and culture. If you are using a vocation template, suggestions are spelled out there. In general, however, grogs should choose the Abilities they need to be warriors, guards, and servants. Typically these include good Weapon Class scores, Awareness, Survival, or Chirurgy. Companions generally have high scores in Abilities related to their specialty, whatever that is.

It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other academic knowledge without a score of at least three in this one.</p> <p>The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)</p> <p>Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The auctores are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the auctor, in his logica vetus and logic nova. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The auctor is Cicero, especially his De Inventione.</p> <p>Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The auctor is Boethius, De arithmetica. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the auctor is Euclid, in his Elementa. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's Optica is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the auctor is Ptolemy, in the Libri Almagesti. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in De Musica. Specialties: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music. (Intelligence)</p> <p>Civil and Canon Law: Civil Law is the law of the Roman Empire. Most local legal systems are based upon it (England being the notable exception), and when a law is needed to govern international relations, Civil Law is appealed to. The authority is Justinian's Digest. Canon Law is the law of the Church. It is important to Mythic Europe as it applies in all nations, governing the working of the church and some other areas, such as marriage. It is important to note that members of the clergy are only subject to canon law, not customary or civil law. Most high churchmen are skilled canonists, not theologians. Canon Law is made by Papal bulls (pronouncements), but the auctor is Gratian, in his Decretum. This skill covers the knowledge of both types of law. Specialties: laws and customs of a specific area, papal laws.

Medical practice is based on the theory of the four humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Diseases are believed to be caused by imbalances among them, hence such practices as bloodletting, to restore the balance. The auctores are Galen and Hippocrates, in many works. Medicine may be used in the place of Chirurgy, by an individual so trained. Specialties: anatomy, apothecary, physician. (Intelligence)</p> <p>Philosophiae: There are three philosophies\u2014natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. Aristotle is the auctor for all of them, in different books. Most scholars study the philosophies after the Arts but before going on to Law, Theology or Medicine. Natural philosophy is the study of the sub-lunar world. It roughly corresponds to today's science. The main texts are the Physica, De Meteorologia, and De historia animalium. Moral philosophy is the study of the proper way of human life. It covers ethics, politics, and economics\u2014the texts are the Ethica, Politica, and Economica. Metaphysics is the philosophy of the fundamental nature of the world. The main text is Aristotle's Metaphysica. Specialties: natural philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics.

Characters with foreign backgrounds may choose either of these instead of Latin. Specialties: academic usage, Church ceremonies, Hermetic usage. (Intelligence)</p> <p>Theology: Theology is the study of God and his work in the world. The auctores are the Bible and Peter the Lombard's Sententiae, the Bible having theoretical primacy, being infallible, and the Sentences being most studied. The speculations of theology are very abstruse, and many theologians are accused of heresy. Sometimes those accused recant, and sometimes they convince the Church that they were right after all.

He assures me that I will be allowed to leave.</p> <p>He came to me on the day after I arrived, and offered to show me around the place. This is the covenant Voluntas, part of the Order of Hermes. The magi, those whom I saw at the council, rule the covenant, while the consortes like Jocelin see to day to day administration and the turb does all the menial work. The magi all have private areas, which Jocelin refused to show me: he said it was too dangerous. Julia of Jerbiton, my mistress, is the most approachable of them. Kirist of Flambeau, the one in red, has a nasty temper, and can make you burn by snapping his fingers. Phessallia of Merinita, the woman in white, is cruel and cold, and I should stay away from her. Corvus the Raven of Bjornaer is just wrapped up in his own world, and doesn't like interruptions. Desiderius of Verditius is a necromancer, and would be more interested in me were I dead. I asked Jocelin where all these places \u2014 Jerbiton, Flambeau, and the rest \u2014 were, and he laughed, saying that they were not places, although they were houses.

She warned me about stealing from the</p> <p></p> <p>larder, and told me that I was not a magus yet. He showed me round the dormitories, and took me to the door of the library and showed me a crack in the door. I peered in, and I was amazed. There were dozens of books, maybe more than two hundred. Jocelin told me that the library was off-limits to all but the magi, but that most covenfolk could not read, anyway. Then he took me to meet the grogs, the soldiers who had guarded me on the way here. The leader of the grogs is a woman, although I didn't realize that until she spoke. I think I was a bit rude in my confusion, but Maud just laughed and went back to training the others. Jocelin explained that the grogs were there to protect me, and were supposed to die to defend me, if necessary. I asked him why, since I was nobody important.

The most immediate advantage of Hermetic magic was that it allowed wizards of diverse magical backgrounds to share their knowledge. Before Bonisagus' theory, the practice of magic had been highly individualized and therefore limited in scope. With the ability to share and accumulate knowledge, Hermetic magi gained an immense advantage over other wizards. This universal theory is not without its disadvantages, however. Detractors of the system believe that the strict regimentation of Hermetic magic robs truly brilliant magi of the chance to discover the modes of magic power that best suit them, and that it is truly helpful only to mediocre magi who need an exact system to guide them.</p> <p>The Order of Hermes is only a part of the greater magical world. There exist non-Hermetic magi from European traditions, whose magic can be quite powerful in specific areas but is less flexible than that practiced by the members of the Order. There are rumors that groups of wizards from Araby and far-off Cathay use magic that is quite different even from the non-Hermetic magi of Europe. Be this as it may, the rules presented here cover Hermetic magic only. Storyguides should feel free to create non-Hermetic magic that governs monsters, wizards, and magic items that do not fit the paradigm set out in these rules, and thus keep magic a mystery even to those who think they know it all.</p> <p>Hermetic magic is a highly useful but not entirely perfect theory. These rules reflect the things that magi expect to happen when they work with magic. While the expected usually occurs, the exact effects of magic can be influenced by countless factors, including such vagaries as the phase of the moon, the spiritual nature of the target, and the mental state of the caster.

Techniques govern the essential manipulations that magic can perform; Forms, the essential natural phenomena that magic can manipulate. Techniques and Forms have Latin names. A Technique is referred to by a verb conjugated in first person, and a Form by a noun. You combine one Technique and one Form to cast a spell, and together their names indicate the spell's general function. For example, a \"Creo Ignem\" spell employs the Technique of \"Creo\" (\"I create\") and the Form of \"Ignem\" (\"fire\") and produces light, heat, or fire. A \"Muto Ignem\" spell (\"Muto\"=\"I transform\") transforms light, heat, or fire in some way, such as by increasing its intensity, its size, or its shape.</p> <p>Hermetic magi have a score in each Art, just as if it were an Ability. Your scores in the Arts represent your aptitude for working with the various types of magic. But Arts are not merely knowledges; your Arts are ultimately ways your very being expresses magical energy. In reflection of this, your score in a Form (in addition to allowing you to cast spells incorporating that Form) helps you resist spells of that type and avoid harm from mundane sources related to that Form. For instance, your Ignem (fire) score gives you a bonus to resist damage from fire and cold.</p> <p>In the following two sections, each of the Arts is listed with its common two-letter abbreviation, its translation from Latin, a general description, and its Hermetic pronunciation.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-65/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 65","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER III</p> <p>HERMETIC MAGIC</p> <p>65</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-65/#techniques","title":"Techniques","text":""},{"location":"page-refs/page-65/#creo-cr-i-create","title":"Creo (Cr) \"I create\"","text":"<p>This Art allows you to produce objects from nothing.

She, and the other magi here, are members of the Order of Hermes, which seems to be much like the Cistercian Order to which I once belonged. It is divided into twelve Houses, of which Jerbiton is hers, and will, as her apprentice, one day be mine. The Order governs magi by the Code, which is enforced by the Quaesitores and at the Tribunals, which meet every seven years, one in each region of Europe. My mistress wants to build a Great Chamber, a new meeting place for our Tribunal, in London, because she says that the covenant of Blackthorn, as host, unduly influences the decisions. There are no abbots in this Order, and every magus has a say, so there is no-one to stand against Blackthorn\u2019s corruption.</p> <p>Covenants, like Blackthorn and Voluntas, are something like monasteries, I think. Several magi live together, sharing resources and governing themselves. Voluntas has a council of all the magi, and my mistress believes that we should build a fine new chamber for the council meetings, so that their importance is more obvious to the other magi. I think that she wants Corvus and Desiderius to regard them as more than simply distractions from work. They complain every time they are forced to leave their laboratories, even if it is only to fetch a book from the library.</p> <p>My training will last for fifteen years, and at the end of it I will be admitted to the Order, and then I shall have the same rights as my mistress, and the power that Jocelin spoke of.</p> <p>Fourth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress is going to visit another covenant, and she has decided to take Jocelin and me along. This will be the first time I have been out of the covenant since I arrived, apart from brief visits to Wilton, and Jocelin has been helping me with preparations. Henry the Tailor has made me a proper traveling cloak, and Henry the Smith has prepared me a dagger and an ax. We leave at dawn, and Jocelin is being deliberately mysterious about our destination. He won\u2019t tell me where the covenant Semitae is, telling me that I shall understand when we get there.</p> <p>Eighth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>We were attacked by brigands today. They were waiting in ambush, and the grogs had to fight them off at first, until my mistress could cast a spell. The spell, and the speech that she made after casting it, convinced them that we were important allies. They swore by the Holy Cross that they would not harm us, and then escorted us to the edge of their territory. Jocelin noted the route, and says that we will return another way. I don\u2019t see why: we dealt with them easily, but Jocelin is afraid to rely on magic too much.</p> <p>Twelfth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>We have arrived at the covenant Semitae, and I see what Jocelin meant. The covenant lives in several large wagons, and travels around the Tribunal. Their route is planned by Gerfallon of Criamon, the head of the covenant, which Jocelin says makes it nearly impossible for any sane person to track them down. My mistress is closeted with Gerfallon, but I haven\u2019t seen him (or her, I don\u2019t know) yet. Junius of Verditius, who makes the wagons, is entertaining us. They are fashioned of iron, so that a magus may have his laboratory in one, and they change the ground that they cross to make a firm road. Junius told us about his new project, which is to make a wagon that can be pulled through the sky and over the seas. He said that the main problem is the horses, and he thinks that he may have to make them as well, mundane horses not being suitable. I suggested that he just make the wagon move itself, but he didn\u2019t like that idea. Wagons do not move themselves naturally, while horses do, so it is easier to enchant a horse to move than to do the same for a wagon. There are so many things to remember when working magic.</p> <p>Thirteenth day of Leo, thirteen hundred and forty first year of Aries.</p> <p>We have left Semitae, and my mistress is pleased with the results of our visit. I asked Jocelin why we had to walk, and he told me that most magi cannot ride horses, because the beasts hate their magic, and throw them off. I am unusual in that. He told me not to ask my mistress about it, because she is sensitive on the subject.</p> <p>Twentieth day of Virgo, thirteen hundred and forty second year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress is in a foul mood. She went to the council today to try to convince them to build the new council chamber. I have seen the plans: it is heptagonal, with a vaulted stone roof supported by a slender central pillar. It is truly beautiful, but they made her choose between that and the Great Chamber. She chose the bigger project, and made them promise to give her the money for the land next year, but she is still raging about their lack of vision.</p> <p>Ninth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-70/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 70","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>ARS MAGICA</p> <p>THE ART OF MAGIC</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>They cannot affect an area larger than you can see (though the effects may move out of your sight and control once a spell is cast).</li> <li>Their duration cannot be longer than one month.</li> <li>They cannot be used to perceive anything in the past or future.</li> </ul> <p>Ritual spells can surpass these limits, creating farther-reaching and longer-lasting effects.

In addition to involving the two primary Arts\u2014Corpus and Muto in this case\u2014casting the spell concerns your Anim\u00e1l score as well. This third Art is a requisite.</p> <p>Requisites, if any, are listed for each formulaic spell in the Spells chapter. (See the spell Curse of Circe on page 125 as an example.) Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have wider knowledge. You must use the lesser of your score in the requisite and your score in the spell's main Technique or Form\u2014Technique if the requisite is a Technique, Form if the requisite is a Form. For example, if you have the scores Anim\u00e1l 6 and Corpus 13, and you cast the Muto Corpus spell Curse of Circe, which has a requisite of Anim\u00e1l, you treat your Corpus score as if it were only 6. Note that if your requisite happened to be higher (for example, if your Anim\u00e1l were 15), you would use the lower basic form (your Corpus of 13 in this case).</p> <p>Sometimes a spell has a requisite for both its Technique and Form. You must use the lowest in each case. And, if several requisites apply to the same primary Art (for example, if there are two Form requisites), your effective score is the lowest of the group.

If you want to increase the range or duration of a formulaic or ritual spell (to the amount listed after the slash in the description), you expend one pawn of raw vis per 5 levels of the spell or fraction thereof. If you wish to extend both range and duration, you must expend vis for both.

He could also choose to use Perdo vis and Mentem vis in combination, as long as the total number of pawns does not exceed 10 and the number of pawns of Mentem vis does not exceed 6.</p> <p>For laboratory activities, Vim + Magic Theory is the limit to the number of pawns of vis (regardless of type) that you may use in one season.

There are numerous spells described in the Spells chapter that are designed to dispel other magics. Most of these spells are tailored to affect spells of their own Form and Technique.

It serves as a nonlethal way for one magus to establish dominance and precedence over another, and has formal restrictions to keep it from disrupting the unity of the Order. One need not accept a challenge to cert\u00e1men, but the social cost may be no less than that of accepting and losing. You may challenge anyone to cert\u00e1men once, but the Code prohibits you from challenging the same person again unless he challenges you in the meantime. Thus, you cannot hound an unwilling opponent into cert\u00e1men. Cert\u00e1men is solely an institution of the Order of Hermes; non-Hermetic wizards do not have the ability to participate in the ceremony.</p> <p>To engage in cert\u00e1men, you and the other magus must agree on one Form and Technique combination you will both use. If you do not agree on the Form and Technique, the duel cannot take place. By tradition, the aggressor in the duel chooses the Technique and the defender chooses the Form, but this system is purely artificial. The rules of cert\u00e1men permit the use of any system for determining the Arts used as long as it is acceptable to both magi.</p> <p>Once the Technique and Form are chosen, you and your opponent concentrate for a moment, both entering trances. While entranced, competing magi have no defense against physical attacks. Each becomes attuned to the magical forces surrounding them, shaping them into phantasms representing the Technique and Form of the duel. If the Technique and Form are Muto and Anim\u00e1l, the phantasms might be two animals, one controlled by each magi. During the course of the duel, each animal changes into various other animals in an effort to defeat the other. A Creo Ignem contest could consist of two fiery beings fighting. In an Int\u00e9llego Aquam contest it might appear that the combatants are in hazy water, each trying to reach some goal. The illusionary battle is a representation of the more subtle magical battle which affects the minds of the combatants.</p> <p>To attempt to emerge the victor, each combatant rolls a stress die + Technique + Form + Intelligence + Cert\u00e1men each round. The magus with the highest result determines the amount by which he beat the other combatant. These points can be used to weaken the other combatant immediately, or they can be saved and added to the next round's roll.</p> <p>If used to weaken the opponent, roll a stress die + Intelligence + Cert\u00e1men + the difference between your score and your opponent's score. Compare this to your oppo</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-79/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 79","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER III</p> <p>HERMETIC MAGIC</p> <p>nent's roll of a stress die + Stamina + Cert\u00e1men. For every full five points by which you exceed your opponent, your opponent loses one Fatigue level. Penalties for these Fatigue levels lost apply immediately to further rounds of cert\u00e1men.</p> <p>If you save your excess points for your next roll, you hope their addition to that roll gives you an even greater excess score in the next round. However, if your next comparison roll against your opponent is low, you may lose the advantage you had in the previous round. It's a gamble to hold on to points from one round to the next, but doing so can help keep you consistently ahead in the contest until such time as you make a roll that truly devastates your opponent.</p> <p>Relevant Affinities can be applied as bonuses to cert\u00e1men rolls. The magus who chooses the Form of the battle chooses the shapes of the phantasms used. So, if you have an Affinity with wolves and choose wolves as the phantasms, you get your Affinity bonus to your cert\u00e1men rolls.</p> <p>There are three ways to win cert\u00e1men. The first involves wearing your opponent down until he falls unconscious. When this happens, the victor is entitled to cast a single spell at the loser. This spell, which must be of the same Technique and Form of the contest, circumvents the loser's Parma Magica (though the loser still gets a magic resistance roll based on the Form of the spell). In most cert\u00e1men contests, this \"free\" spell is unnecessary, because your opponent's collapse already designates your victory. However, some duelists use it anyway to intimidate and embarrass those who fight them. This free spell can be used to harm your fallen opponent, but remember, cert\u00e1men is intended to be a harmless way to resolve disputes.</p> <p>The second way to win cert\u00e1men is by surrender. If your opponent realizes he is outmatched, or wants to walk away from the duel, he can concede the con</p> <p></p> <p>test. Such a submission means that loser is still capable of defending himself, so he has full Parma Magica and Magic Resistance against any final spell cast at him.</p> <p>The third way to win cert\u00e1men is to maintain concentration in the face of distraction when your opponent does not. Concentration rolls are not necessitated by the loss of Fatigue levels during cert\u00e1men. Sometimes, however, conditions surrounding the duel necessitate that the duelists make Concentration rolls. If one of the duelists fails a Concentration roll, the fight ends. The duelist's loss of concentration causes his phantasm to disappear, indicating the opponent's victory. A victor through loss of concentration does not get a free spell.</p> <p>Loss of concentration, however, does not necessarily mean that cert\u00e1men is over and that a victor is decided. If the victor under these circumstances refuses the honor, and the combatant who lost concentration agrees, the battle may resume until a clear victor emerges. A magus might refuse a victory by loss of concentration for reasons of honor, or because he intends to do more harm.</p> <p>You can use raw vis at any time during cert\u00e1men, even if your opponent doesn't use it or doesn't expect its use. For every pawn you expend, add 5 to a single contest roll. This bonus applies to your rolls that involve Form and Technique, not to rolls that determine Fatigue levels lost by your opponent. Raw vis used must be attuned to one of the Arts used in the duel, either Form or Technique. The number of pawns you can use in one round is limited to your score in the Form or Technique the vis is attuned to or your cert\u00e1men score, whichever is lower.</p> <p>If the duel is integrated into a melee situation, rolls for cert\u00e1men are made in the magic phase of the round. Magi involved in cert\u00e1men can do nothing else until the duel is resolved.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-8/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 8","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>ARS MAGICA</p> <p>THE ART OF MAGIC</p> <p>The covenant council have given my mistress the money for the land, and so we are going to London.

Jocelin took me around for an hour or so, showing me how to get to the inn from St. Paul's, and where I could buy food. Then he left me. I think I lost my purse less than half an hour after that, but it is no matter. The merchants balance the thieves, and I can make as many silver pennies as I need. I watched a miracle play, which showed the martyrdom of St. Catherine, and wandered round St. Paul's, listening to people conduct business until they realized I was eavesdropping.</p> <p>Then I wandered up among the merchant houses, and met Elisabeth. She is working as a servant for one of the big houses, and was happy to go with me to an inn. I bought her wine, rather than the cheaper ale, and made sure that we were away before sunset. It's amazing what a tiny amount of magic can achieve. Perdo Mentem made her forget the time and the greetings from her friends, Creo Mentem enhanced her liking for me, and Creo Corpus made her burn with lust. Magic, and a bit of timing. The sun set while we were in flagrante delicto, so she barely noticed the magic wear off. She did hurry home as soon as we had finished, though, and I got back to the inn to discover that I had missed Jocelin's performance. Ah well.</p> <p>Twenty sixth day of Gemini, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>Elisabeth had a young man, it seems. Quite a wealthy one, with a large number of rough friends. They sent a messenger, claiming to be from her, and like a fool I followed him. They were all waiting for me, and I couldn't affect</p> <p>enough of them. I don't know if they would have killed me, but Jocelin arrived, with the household guards of some noble, and they fled. He has promised not to tell my mistress, and hopes that I have learnt a lesson.</p> <p>I certainly have. I must get my mistress to teach me more Int\u00e9llego.</p> <p>First day of Cancer, thirteen hundred and forty third year of Aries.</p> <p>The negotiations are complete, and my mistress holds the deeds to a large plot of land just outside the city. She has spent most of today expounding her plans for the Great Chamber, both as a masterpiece of architecture and art and as a place where all the magi of the Tribunal can meet away from the influence of Blackthorn. Apparently Semitae has also agreed to support this idea. We shall leave London tomorrow, and I still haven't heard Jocelin sing.</p> <p>Tenth day of Libra, thirteen hundred and forty seventh year of Aries.</p> <p>My mistress talked to representatives of many covenants at last year's Tribunal, and now we are traveling about the country to negotiate support for the Great Chamber. She plans to form a religious order to look after it while the magi are not using it, thus giving it legitimacy while preserving our control. Personally, I doubt that many magi will want to meet in the Dominion, but she plans to portray that as a benefit: it grants additional safety to those attending Tribunal.</p> <p>We have come to the covenant Schola Pythagoranis in Cambridge. They are well-disposed to us, as House Jerbiton dominates them, but they are more interested in scholarship than art, and I think that our visit is somewhat ill-timed. They have taken advantage of the dissolution of the university at Oxford to lure the Masters and scholars here, and the town is bursting at the seams. It is strange to be in a town, and all the churches be closed. Even the round church of the Holy Sepulcher is closed, although I thought that the Templars had an exemption from the interdict. Jocelin is nervous about his immortal soul, but I told him not to worry: the faithful are not damned merely by dying during an interdict.</p> <p>We are being accommodated in one of the covenant's houses for tonight: they have buildings scattered through the town.

We also see that the basic range for Creo Ignem is Near, the basic duration is Momentary, and the basic target is Small. The magus wishes to be able to do this from across the room, so the range Near makes sense. He wants it to set logs on fire, but the magic need not sustain the fire\u2014wood will burn by itself once ignited. The duration is therefore Momentary, as per the default. The magus decides that the target Small is not large enough to ignite the large fireplace in his covenant's great hall. Therefore, he must move the default target of Small up one step to Individual, adding five levels.

powers.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-85/#talismans","title":"Talismans","text":"<p>Talismans help you concentrate and extend your magical powers. A talisman is a very personal item that contains magics and materials that tie it intimately to you and that can be used as a channel for your magical power.</p> <p>To create a talisman, you must first choose the item's physical form and prepare the item for enchantment as described above. Once you have prepared the item for enchantment, you must simply spend one season attuning the item's mystical energies to your own. At the end of this season, you have a talisman that may be used to aid your magic.</p> <p>Talismans have several powers. First, your talisman is an extension of your touch as long as you're in contact with it. When you cast a spell of Touch range, you may reach your target by touching him with your talisman. Thus, if your talisman is a staff, your reach is increased by the length of the staff. Second, you always have an arcane connection to your talisman, making it easy to find if it is lost (but also making it a hazard if it falls into enemy hands). Third, your talisman is fully protected by your Magic Resistance if you are touching any part of it. Thus, while an outstretched staff can extend outside the radius of your usual Magic Resistance, it is still fully protected. Finally, even when you're not touching your talisman, it receives the Magic Resistance offered by your Form scores.</p> <p>In addition to the basic powers of a Talisman, you may also, at any time, spend a season to open your talisman to one kind of magic attunement, based on the shape and material of the talisman. Use the \"Form and Effect Bonuses Table\" to determine what attunements are possible. Your talisman may be able to accept more than one kind of attunement, and can hold more than one attunement, but you can only invest one new attunement per season. For instance, a magus can enhance his staff talisman by spending a season to attune it to spells that control things at a distance. He then gets a +4 bonus on rolls with spells that control things at a distance (because that is the bonus listed on the Form and Effect Bonuses Table). He could further enhance it to give him a +3 to project bolts and missiles (for example), but that would take another season.</p> <p>Bonuses from attunements only apply when the magus is touching the talisman. They do not apply to Magic Resistance or any laboratory activities. There's no limit to the number of attunements a talisman can have at one time, though remember that you can only add one per season. There's no roll involved in giving your talisman an attunement bonus; you must simply spend the time to get the bonus.</p> <p>You can only have one talisman at a time; one must be completely destroyed before you can make another, and you cannot make a talisman for someone else.</p> <p>You can instill effects into a talisman (see \"Invested Devices,\" below), and because the talisman has already been set up to have an intimate connection to your magic ability, you receive a +2 bonus to your Lab Total to invest it with effects. You can also turn an item already invested with magical powers into your talisman. Whether you invest an item with effects or whether it already has magic powers, an item only needs to be prepared for enchantment once. When that has been done, you simply need to spend the season to make it your talisman.</p> <p>Note that a talisman is different from a spell focus. A talisman is personalized to a magus and can give a bonus to many of his spells. A spell focus, on the other hand, is specific to a given spell (see those listed in the Spells chapter). You can, if you wish, make a spell focus into your talisman\u2014it retains all the benefits of both.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-85/#invested-devices","title":"Invested Devices","text":"<p>Once an item has been prepared for enchantment, you may spend time and magical resources to bestow magical powers upon it.

Consult the \"Effect Frequency Table.\" The number you choose corresponds to a modifier, which is added to the level of the effect. Next, if the effect is not of Constant Use, you must specify a triggering action or ritual of some kind to activate the effect. The trigger must be specific about exactly what actions need to be performed. A trigger can involve a command word or phrase, moving the item in a specific way (for example, waving or pointing a wand), a stance to be adopted, or anything physical that you can imagine. The enchanted item cannot read thoughts, so the trigger action must be physical, not mental.</p> <p>Finally, choose any effect modifications you wish to apply to the device (see below), adjusting the level of the effect for each modification.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-86/#effect-modifications","title":"Effect Modifications","text":"<p>You have some options on how effects in an invested device operate.

For each factor of range and duration that you want to leave open to accept vis in the field, add +3 to the effect's level. For instance, a healing wand only heals damage temporarily unless vis is used with it (the same amount of vis that is required for the spell being imitated). Therefore, you must leave the user the option to add vis to extend the duration of the effect, thereby adding 3 levels to the effect. The number of pawns of vis that may be used in the field to extend range and duration is limited. The wielder may only expend a number of pawns of vis equal to his score in the Art that corresponds to the type of vis being used.</p> <p>Penetration: You may elect to have the effect make Penetration rolls using the Art scores you had when the effect was originally invested, rather than using the device's own power, by adding +4 to the level.

This option adds +5 to the effect's level. Note that the wielder still needs to concentrate to change how the effect is used. For instance, a levitation belt that does not require concentration can hold someone in the air, but to move up or down the wielder must concentrate. Effects left to their own concentration start to wear off at sunset and sunrise. At these times the wielder must concentrate on the effect for a few moments to perpetuate it until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first.</p> <p>Effect Use: You can restrict the use of a device's effect to a specific list of people (for example, to you and all your current apprentices) by adding +3 to the level of the effect. Otherwise, invested devices can be activated by anyone who knows their trigger actions.</p> <p>Charges: It is possible to instill an effect whose power expires after a given number of uses. The following table lists Lab Total modifiers to place a given number of charges in a device. Each time the power you have instilled is activated, one charge is used up. When all the charges have been used, the item stops functioning.</p> <p>Note that you must still choose a number of uses per day when you instill an item with charges. Thus such an item is restricted in how often and how much it can be used. You cannot give charges to an item of Constant Use.</p> <p>A device that uses charges can be made rechargeable by adding 5 levels to the level of the effect. Actually recharging the effect takes one season and costs an amount of vis equal to that which was originally spent investing the effect.

If the amount of raw vis required to instill an effect brings the total amount of raw vis used above the total used to prepare the item for enchantment in the first place, the effect cannot be invested. So if you are enchanting a silver dagger (which takes 12 pawns of vis to prepare for enchantment), you can only put 12 pawns worth of effects in it.

Magi of two hundred years or older are rare, but not unheard of.</p> <p>The longevity potion acts as a magical anchor, sustaining the vital life force of the magus, often by directly affecting the tissues of the magus's body.

Though called a potion, the longevity effect may be imparted through any number of media. Charms, potions, clothes, and tattoos are just some of the possibilities, each one having unique properties. A longevity charm, for example, has to be worn constantly to provide its preserving power; if it were removed, you could die immediately, or you might slowly fade away until the charm was returned or a new longevity \"potion\" created.

Unfortunately, most of the forest is under the control of the faerie, and all attempts to construct laboratories have been thwarted. He wants us to negotiate a peace with the fay. If we succeed, he will support my mistress's plan at the next Tribunal. She agreed, of course.

This event deserves a more detailed account, however. The forest is only an hour's travel from Cambridge, and so we left shortly before dawn, my mistress preferring to deal with the faeries of the light. We arrived there a while after the sun had risen, and walked into the forest. My mistress was calling out that we wanted to speak with the ruler of this place, and the grogs were looking around nervously. I, of course, maintained my poise and dignity, as did Jocelin. He said that the fay were well known to be fond of minstrels, so he felt safe.</p> <p>After we had wandered for an hour, Guy, our woodsman, announced that we were lost, and that he could no longer make sense of the vegetation. My mistress was pleased at the news because, she said, it showed that we had entered the faerie forest. I felt a burning by my side, and realized that my knife was glowing with red heat. I plucked it from the sheath and threw it to the ground, where it melted and ran away like water. All around me, the grogs were doing the same. Poor Stephen was wearing chain mail, and</p> <p>we could not get it off him in time. As we stood there, completely unarmed, Jocelin said, quietly, \"I seem to remember that faeries dislike iron.\" My mistress turned on him, and seemed about to do something serious, but after a moment she relaxed.</p> <p>\"Yes, I should have thought. My apologies, lord.\" I was confused for a moment, until I followed her gaze, and saw that the faeries had arrived. Their lord was dressed in gleaming silver armor like the scales of a fish, and sat on a throne of ice, which sparkled in the sun. Beside him stood his guards, great bears in a silver livery, carrying clubs the size of young trees. At the lord's feet sat his minstrel, a tiny creature with enormously long, spindly fingers, which cradled a lute. I sensed other eyes on us, but I could see nothing.</p> <p>\"Why have you sought me out?\" the lord asked. My mistress replied.</p> <p>\"We are here on behalf of the magi of Schola Pythagoranis. They seek permission to build a laboratory on the edge of your wood.\"</p> <p>\"Why should I permit that?\" My mistress was silent, and Jocelin stepped forward, clearing his throat.</p> <p>\"Would you accept a wager for your permission?\" The faerie lord considered him, and nodded.</p> <p>\"Perhaps. What wager, and what contest?\"</p> <p>\"A singing contest, between me and your minstrel. If I win, you will allow the magi of Schola Pythagoranis to build and use laboratories in that area of your woods, for as long as they wish. If he wins, they will give up any attempt to build there.\"</p> <p>\"And you will remain here as my servant, until you die.\"</p> <p>\"Agreed.\" He said it quickly, before any of us could intervene. My mistress was pale, and went to talk to him, but he waved her away, turning his attention to tuning his lute. He looked at me over the frets and winked, and I realized that I was finally going to hear him sing.</p> <p>He struck a chord, and began. It was an old lay, the tale of a faerie maiden who enslaved human knights with her beauty, and kept them imprisoned in a cave. He sang well, and the faerie minstrel joined in. Its fingers moved like lightning over the strings, and it seemed to be playing three parts at once. It opened its mouth to sing, and three voices spilled out, the high voice of a young boy, the deep voice of a mature man, and a voice that was like the singing of birds in the dawn.

You may, with the approval of the troupe or storyguide, substitute any type of vis that your magical talents are strongly associated with.</p> <p>A longevity potion's effect lasts until you actually suffer the ill effects of aging; that is, you develop an affliction, have the score of an existing affliction increase, or gain a Decrepitude point through aging (see \"Aging\" on page 180). After this, the potion loses its effectiveness and a new potion must be brewed. You can invent a new potion (following the normal rules for doing so), or brew a new batch from the old formula. This involves simply making a new investment of vis (of an amount based on your current age) but no significant investment in time. This \"replacement\" potion may be created using your lab text (see next section) from the previous brewing. If your longevity potion fails and you make aging rolls before you create a new one, you suffer the full effects of your age. You do not gain back any affliction points or Decrepitude points that you suffered when you were not under the effects of a potion when you do finally take one.</p> <p>When creating a longevity potion for the first time, you can increase its potency by adding extra vis to the brew. This vis is above and beyond that which you must spend for your current age. For each additional pawn you add to the brew, add 1 to your Lab Total. This vis is invested when you originally create a given version of a potion, but you must use the same amount of vis with each new potion of this formula that you make when the previous one fails. If you reinvent the potion to take advantage of increased Art scores, you can choose not to use extra vis. Extra vis spent does not increase your Lab Total to determine if you can create a longevity potion in the first place.</p> <p>You can make longevity potions for others, even for non-magi. To determine the ingredients for another person's potion, you and that character must spend one season of research and brewing. Your Lab Total (based on Intellego Corpus), plus aura, must equal 30+. Otherwise, you cannot determine what ingredients need to go into the potion. If your score is 30+, you can make the potion and must invest one pawn of vis per five years of the character's current age. A longevity potion made for another magus functions just as if made for you (-1 to aging rolls for every 5 points of Lab Total). Non-magical people, however, are not as resilient as magi. The potion you create for a mundane therefore only subtracts one from the character's aging rolls for every 10 full points in your Lab Total.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-90/#laboratory-texts","title":"Laboratory Texts","text":"<p>When you instill a power into an enchanted item or create a batch of potions, your work is not forgotten as soon as the enchantment is complete. You create a laboratory text to record your work, and you can use the lab text to help you recreate your work. Lab texts can record the enchantment of devices, the brewing of potions, and the creation of longevity potions. Because of the inflexible, complex nature of enchantments, however, a lab text is not as useful as a spell written out in full.

If you have a lab text describing how to create a batch of potions, you get a bonus to your Lab Total when creating a batch of potions with the same powers. Lab texts that detail longevity potions also give a bonus to the magus's Lab Total, making more recent potions more potent and more helpful to resisting aging.

All of this indicates how the item was created, what its powers are, and how to unleash them.</p> <p>You discover the powers in an enchanted device in order from weakest to strongest, that is, from the power of the lowest effect level to that of the highest. (A device's function as a talisman is treated as a level 20 power.) When you investigate an enchantment for the first time, you spend a season, add a stress die to your Int\u00e9llego Vim Lab Total, add in your aura, and compare the result to the level of the weakest power in the enchantment. If you succeed in your roll to find the weakest power, you may roll again in that same season to identify the power immediately above it in strength. For example, if a device has three powers of level 10, 20, and 30 and you rolled a Lab Total of 25, you do not automatically find the first two powers. As your rolled Lab Total is over 10 (the level of the first power), you find the first power and may roll again in the season to find the second power (level 20), and the third power if you discover the second. Note that the level of a power in an enchanted device includes any effect modifications that apply to the power (see \"Invested Devices,\" page 85).</p> <p>As long as you succeed in finding powers, you keep rolling to find more in that season.

A golden cord connects your magical abilities, a silver cord connects your minds, and a bronze cord connects your bodies. These cords may be seen by someone with the Second Sight Virtue, but they are otherwise imperceptible.</p> <p>The strength of each of these cords is rated from 0 to +3. To determine all the cords' ratings, divide the points of your bond score among them however you choose and then use the points allocated to each to buy cord scores. A cord strength of 0 costs nothing, a strength of +1 requires 5 points, a score of +2 requires 15 points, and a score of +3 requires 30 points. The total cost of the cords you buy cannot exceed your bond score.</p> <p>Each cord has a varying effect (described below) depending on how well it is forged. Regardless of the strength, however, effects apply only when the familiar is within 100 paces of you. On the positive side, these benefits also apply to the familiar.</p> <p>The Golden Cord: The familiar helps you avoid magical errors, letting you roll fewer botch rolls when using magic. Your golden cord score is the number subtracted from the number of botch rolls you would normally make (though you must always roll at least one).</p> <p>The Silver Cord: You can apply your silver cord score as a bonus to all rolls that involve Personality Traits, to natural resistance rolls against mental magic, and to rolls to protect you from a natural mental influence like intimidation or verbal trickery. In addition, if your mind is ever overcome by another force your familiar may be able to free you. To be successful, it must roll 9+ on a stress die with the silver cord score as its bonus (one attempt per day). If the roll botches, the animal's mind is overcome along with yours.</p> <p>The Bronze Cord: You can apply your bronze cord score as a bonus to Soak rolls, to healing rolls, and to rolls to withstand deprivation (such as to holding your breath or resisting sleepiness). It does not help you withstand Fatigue.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-97/","title":"Rulebook \u2013 Page 97","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>This page is raw OCR source material and may contain errors.</p> <p>CHAPTER IV LABORATORY 97</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-97/#the-third-season","title":"The Third Season","text":""},{"location":"page-refs/page-97/#tempering-the-bond","title":"Tempering the Bond","text":"<p>In the third season, you strengthen the bond between you and your familiar by evoking certain magical powers through the bond.

Negative bond qualities provide you with additional points for purchasing positive bond qualities, just like Flaws provide extra points for Virtue purchase.</p> <p>Almost all bond qualities affect both you and your familiar in some related way; they characterize your bond. By choosing bond qualities you are determining how the physical, mental, and magical qualities of each of you affect the other. In addition, almost all bond qualities are accompanied by the exchange of some minor physical, mental, or (rarely) magical quirk or habit related to a particular bond characteristic. For example, if you choose a bond characteristic that increases your awareness of each other, then you might each gain some minor habit linked to each other's special sensory strengths: for example, a magus with a dog familiar may sniff people when he first meets them, whereas the dog scrutinizes the text of signs and book covers.</p> <p>You and the storyguide must agree on all changes that you and a familiar undergo during the formation of the bond. There are several factors you can consider to choose these changes. Perhaps your magic Arts indicate the type of powers the familiar receives. Perhaps the qualities you receive from your familiar are based on the beast's abilities, either natural abilities, such as a cat's ability to see in the dark, or on any natural magical Powers the beast may have possessed before it became your familiar.</p> <p>See \"Bond Qualities\" for powers you and your familiar may share. The qualities listed can be considered guidelines, and you may create any new bond quality you like, provided it works similarly to those shown and you get the storyguide's approval. Some tales tell of magi who invest familiars with superior powers and abilities by actually reducing their own powers and abilities. However, the nature of the bond between familiar and magus requires that the magus gain something in return, though the boon gained to offset a given loss of ability may be subtle.</p>"},{"location":"page-refs/page-97/#the-fourth-season","title":"The Fourth Season","text":""},{"location":"page-refs/page-97/#closing-the-enchantment","title":"Closing the Enchantment","text":"<p>In the fourth season of the familiar's enchantment, you simultaneously complete the enchantment and close it so that it cannot be dispelled, which takes another three pawns of Vim vis.
